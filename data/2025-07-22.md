*Andreas Alpers,Orkun Furat,Christian Jung,Matthias Neumann,Claudia Redenbach,Aigerim Saken,Volker Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较分析用于拟合3D图像数据的镶嵌模型算法策略，评估优化方法并权衡模型复杂度与拟合质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在材料科学中，准确拟合3D图像数据（如多晶体和泡沫）的镶嵌模型对理解微观结构至关重要。

Method: 比较线性/非线性规划、随机优化（交叉熵法）和梯度下降等方法，生成Voronoi、Laguerre和GBPD模型。

Result: 通过体积、表面积和拓扑差异评估拟合质量，揭示模型复杂度、优化难度与近似质量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 为根据数据特征和应用需求选择合适方法提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of algorithmic strategies for
fitting tessellation models to 3D image data of materials such as polycrystals
and foams. In this steadily advancing field, we review and assess
optimization-based methods -- including linear and nonlinear programming,
stochastic optimization via the cross-entropy method, and gradient descent --
for generating Voronoi, Laguerre, and generalized balanced power diagrams
(GBPDs) that approximate voxelbased grain structures. The quality of fit is
evaluated on real-world datasets using discrepancy measures that quantify
differences in grain volume, surface area, and topology. Our results highlight
trade-offs between model complexity, the complexity of the optimization
routines involved, and the quality of approximation, providing guidance for
selecting appropriate methods based on data characteristics and application
needs.

### [2] [Semantic Segmentation based Scene Understanding in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14303)
*Ehsan Rassekh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习在自动驾驶场景理解中的应用，提出了几种高效的语义分割模型，并研究了不同主干网络对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能的发展，深度学习在复杂任务中表现出色，尤其是在自动驾驶领域。研究旨在通过语义分割提升场景理解能力。

Method: 使用BDD100k数据集，提出多种高效模型，并尝试不同主干网络作为编码器。

Result: 实验表明，选择合适的主干网络显著影响语义分割模型的性能，最终模型的准确性、平均IoU和损失函数均有所提升。

Conclusion: 通过优化主干网络，语义分割模型的性能得到显著改善，有助于更好地理解自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
prominent keyword because it is promising in solving complex tasks. The need
for human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines
have achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the
right decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help
of deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence
technologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the
development of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In
this work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene
understanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to
investigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of
several Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that
choosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the
model for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation
allows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.
In the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,
mean IoU, and loss function, and the results show that these metrics are
improved.

### [3] [CLIPTTA: Robust Contrastive Vision-Language Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14312)
*Marc Lafon,Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim,Clément Rambour,Christian Desrosier,Nicolas Thome*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPTTA是一种基于梯度的测试时适应方法，针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）设计，通过软对比损失提升分布偏移下的泛化能力，并在开放集设置中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于熵最小化的测试时适应方法（TTA）与视觉语言模型的对比训练目标不匹配，导致性能受限和失败模式（如伪标签漂移和类崩溃）。

Method: CLIPTTA采用与CLIP预训练目标一致的软对比损失，并通过理论分析其梯度设计避免崩溃风险；在开放集设置中，使用Outlier Contrastive Exposure（OCE）损失提升OOD检测。

Result: 在75个数据集上的实验表明，CLIPTTA优于基于熵的目标，并在多种分布偏移下表现稳定，优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: CLIPTTA为视觉语言模型提供了一种有效的测试时适应方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在开放集和分布偏移场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities
but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation
(TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically
via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned
with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation
performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class
collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for
vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with
CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's
gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse.
We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution
(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier
Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75
datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms
entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA
methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more
stable performance across diverse shifts.

### [4] [A Hidden Stumbling Block in Generalized Category Discovery: Distracted Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14315)
*Qiyu Xu,Zhanxuan Hu,Yu Duan,Ercheng Pei,Yonghang Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为注意力聚焦（AF）的机制，通过剪除非信息性标记来解决广义类别发现（GCD）中的注意力分散问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法在处理未标记数据时容易受到背景区域的干扰，导致特征提取不理想。

Method: AF由两个组件组成：标记重要性测量（TIME）和多尺度标记自适应剪枝（TAP），通过量化标记重要性并剪除非信息性标记来优化注意力。

Result: 将AF集成到SimGCD方法中，性能提升了15.4%，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: AF是一种轻量级、即插即用的模块，能有效提升GCD方法的性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabeled data from
both known and unknown categories by leveraging knowledge from labeled known
categories. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often
overlook a hidden stumbling block in GCD: distracted attention. Specifically,
when processing unlabeled data, models tend to focus not only on key objects in
the image but also on task-irrelevant background regions, leading to suboptimal
feature extraction. To remove this stumbling block, we propose Attention
Focusing (AF), an adaptive mechanism designed to sharpen the model's focus by
pruning non-informative tokens. AF consists of two simple yet effective
components: Token Importance Measurement (TIME) and Token Adaptive Pruning
(TAP), working in a cascade. TIME quantifies token importance across multiple
scales, while TAP prunes non-informative tokens by utilizing the multi-scale
importance scores provided by TIME. AF is a lightweight, plug-and-play module
that integrates seamlessly into existing GCD methods with minimal computational
overhead. When incorporated into one prominent GCD method, SimGCD, AF achieves
up to 15.4% performance improvement over the baseline with minimal
computational overhead. The implementation code is provided in
https://github.com/Afleve/AFGCD.

### [5] [Hallucination Score: Towards Mitigating Hallucinations in Generative Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14367)
*Weiming Ren,Raghav Goyal,Zhiming Hu,Tristan Ty Aumentado-Armstrong,Iqbal Mohomed,Alex Levinshtein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）评估生成超分辨率（GSR）中的幻觉问题，并提出了“幻觉分数”（HS）和基于深度特征的奖励函数来减轻幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成超分辨率（GSR）在感知图像质量上表现优异，但存在幻觉问题（生成细节与低分辨率图像或真实图像不匹配），这一问题限制了其实际应用。现有指标无法有效衡量此类问题。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）构建提示，评估幻觉视觉元素并生成幻觉分数（HS）。同时，发现某些深度特征距离与HS强相关，提出将其作为可微分奖励函数来对齐GSR模型。

Result: HS与人类评估高度一致，并为超分辨率（SR）模型的现有指标提供了补充信息。深度特征距离与HS的强相关性被证实。

Conclusion: 通过HS和深度特征奖励函数，可以有效衡量和减轻GSR中的幻觉问题，提升模型的实用性和感知质量。

Abstract: Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in
terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur
of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models
do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity.
Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to
perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI),
is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical
deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating
these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are
not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they
are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we
take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a
prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a
"Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human
evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics
used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep
feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to
align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions
to mitigate hallucinations.

### [6] [DUSTrack: Semi-automated point tracking in ultrasound videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14368)
*Praneeth Namburi,Roger Pallarès-López,Jessica Rosendorf,Duarte Folgado,Brian W. Anthony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUSTrack是一个结合深度学习和光流的半自动化工具包，用于在B型超声视频中跟踪任意点，解决了噪声和运动模糊等问题，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: B型超声中组织运动的准确跟踪因噪声和低对比度而困难，需一种通用工具支持临床和生物力学研究。

Method: 结合深度学习和光流技术，提供图形界面生成训练数据，并采用新型光流滤波技术减少噪声。

Result: DUSTrack在多种应用场景中表现优异，准确性优于零样本跟踪器，与专用方法相当。

Conclusion: DUSTrack是一个开源、通用的超声组织运动跟踪工具，适用于临床和研究。

Abstract: Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue
behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports
science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound
remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane
movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks
over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical
and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning
and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated
framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine
deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking
across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes
a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality
training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a
novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency
frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack
demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point
trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its
potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical
research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:
cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis
during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an
open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point
tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos. DUSTrack is
available at https://github.com/praneethnamburi/DUSTrack.

*Zhou Chen,Joe Lin,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个神经符号框架，用于可解释的affordance grounding，通过结合ConceptNet和语言模型的结构化常识先验与CLIP的视觉证据，提升场景理解的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景理解中对象与动作关联的透明性和可解释性问题。

Method: 整合ConceptNet和语言模型的常识先验与CLIP的视觉证据，通过基于能量的推理循环迭代优化预测。

Result: 在多对象、无标签设置下，CRAFT提高了准确性并增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: CRAFT为稳健且可信的场景理解提供了重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT, a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable affordance
grounding, which identifies the objects in a scene that enable a given action
(e.g., "cut"). CRAFT integrates structured commonsense priors from ConceptNet
and language models with visual evidence from CLIP, using an energy-based
reasoning loop to refine predictions iteratively. This process yields
transparent, goal-driven decisions to ground symbolic and perceptual
structures. Experiments in multi-object, label-free settings demonstrate that
CRAFT enhances accuracy while improving interpretability, providing a step
toward robust and trustworthy scene understanding.

*Han Gong,Qiyue Li,Zhi Liu,Hao Zhou,Peng Yuan Zhou,Zhu Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）提升了体积视频表示质量，但带来数据量大和传输复杂的挑战。本文提出基于高斯变形场的3DGS视频构建方法，通过混合显著性分块和差异化质量建模，实现高效压缩和带宽适应。实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS视频数据量大且传输复杂，需解决压缩和带宽适应问题。

Method: 基于高斯变形场的3DGS视频构建，结合混合显著性分块和差异化质量建模。

Result: 实验显示在视频质量、压缩效率和传输速率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了3DGS视频流传输的挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has significantly enhanced the
quality of volumetric video representation. Meanwhile, in contrast to
conventional volumetric video, 3DGS video poses significant challenges for
streaming due to its substantially larger data volume and the heightened
complexity involved in compression and transmission. To address these issues,
we introduce an innovative framework for 3DGS volumetric video streaming.
Specifically, we design a 3DGS video construction method based on the Gaussian
deformation field. By employing hybrid saliency tiling and differentiated
quality modeling of 3DGS video, we achieve efficient data compression and
adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations while ensuring high transmission quality.
Then we build a complete 3DGS video streaming system and validate the
transmission performance. Through experimental evaluation, our method
demonstrated superiority over existing approaches in various aspects, including
video quality, compression effectiveness, and transmission rate.

### [9] [IRGPT: Understanding Real-world Infrared Image with Bi-cross-modal Curriculum on Large-scale Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14449)
*Zhe Cao,Jin Zhang,Ruiheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRGPT是首个针对真实红外图像的多模态大语言模型，基于26万真实红外-文本对数据集IR-TD，通过双跨模态课程迁移学习策略实现优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖合成红外图像，无法捕捉真实红外模态特性，需解决真实红外图像与文本对齐的稀缺问题。

Method: 构建IR-TD数据集，结合LLM生成和规则描述；提出双跨模态课程迁移学习策略，从可见光到红外域系统迁移知识。

Result: 在9项任务（如识别、定位）上达到最先进性能，优于更大规模模型。

Conclusion: IRGPT通过真实数据集和创新学习策略，显著提升了红外图像的多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Real-world infrared imagery presents unique challenges for vision-language
models due to the scarcity of aligned text data and domain-specific
characteristics. Although existing methods have advanced the field, their
reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from
visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique
characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT,
the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images,
built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K
authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared
images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts
originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of
visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we
introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that
systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by
considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT
achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Gestalt原则的并行交互网络（GPI-Net），用于点云配准中的高质量对应点识别，通过正交几何一致性和多粒度交互提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云配准中高质量对应点的识别面临局部与全局特征融合的挑战，Gestalt原则为解决这一问题提供了优势。

Method: 设计了Gestalt引导的并行交互网络，包括正交集成策略、Gestalt特征注意力块和双路径多粒度并行交互聚合块。

Result: 在多个挑战性任务中，GPI-Net表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: GPI-Net通过Gestalt原则和并行交互机制，有效提升了点云配准中对应点的识别质量。

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

Result: 实验表明，所提方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 本文解决了3DGS视频流的关键挑战，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting video (3DGS) streaming has recently emerged as a
research hotspot in both academia and industry, owing to its impressive ability
to deliver immersive 3D video experiences. However, research in this area is
still in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling,
quality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of
solutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by
saliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each
tile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and
multiple quality levels for adaptive selection. We also introduce a novel
quality assessment framework for 3DGS video that jointly evaluates
spatial-domain degradation in 3DGS representations during streaming and the
quality of the resulting 2D rendered images. Additionally, we develop a
meta-learning-based adaptive bitrate algorithm specifically tailored for 3DGS
video streaming, achieving optimal performance across varying network
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GEMINUS是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过混合专家模型（Global Expert和Scene-Adaptive Experts）和Dual-aware Router实现自适应和鲁棒性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模式规划方法难以处理多样化驾驶场景，需要一种能适应复杂交通环境的框架。

Method: GEMINUS结合全局专家、场景自适应专家组和双感知路由器，动态激活专家模块。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优异，驾驶评分和成功率均领先，单目视觉输入下仍达最佳性能。

Conclusion: GEMINUS通过混合专家模型显著提升自动驾驶性能，验证了其适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of
complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode
planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire
diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper
proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework
featuring a Global Expert, a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, and equipped with a
Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall
dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained
on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware
Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty
to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the
Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router,
GEMINUS achieves adaptive and robust performance in diverse scenarios. GEMINUS
outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even
with only monocular vision input. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate
significant improvements over the original single-expert baseline: 7.67% in
Driving Score, 22.06% in Success Rate, and 19.41% in MultiAbility-Mean. The
code will be available at https://github.com/newbrains1/GEMINUS.

*Huayuan Ye,Juntong Chen,Shenzhuo Zhang,Yipeng Zhang,Changbo Wang,Chenhui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisGuard是一个抗篡改的可视化图像数据检索框架，通过嵌入元数据链接解决现有方法易受篡改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可视化图像中嵌入元数据时易受裁剪和编辑等篡改影响，缺乏实用性。

Method: VisGuard采用重复数据平铺、可逆信息广播和基于锚点的裁剪定位技术，增强嵌入数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明VisGuard在数据检索准确性、嵌入容量和安全性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VisGuard能有效促进和保护可视化传播与信息传递。

Abstract: The dissemination of visualizations is primarily in the form of raster
images, which often results in the loss of critical information such as source
code, interactive features, and metadata. While previous methods have proposed
embedding metadata into images to facilitate Visualization Image Data Retrieval
(VIDR), most existing methods lack practicability since they are fragile to
common image tampering during online distribution such as cropping and editing.
To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework
that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images. The embedded data
link remains recoverable even after substantial tampering upon images. We
propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data
tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for
crop localization. VisGuard enables various applications, including interactive
chart reconstruction, tampering detection, and copyright protection. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on VisGuard's superior performance in data retrieval
accuracy, embedding capacity, and security against tampering and steganalysis,
demonstrating VisGuard's competence in facilitating and safeguarding
visualization dissemination and information conveyance.

*Zhenyu Li,Tianyi Shang,Pengjie Xu,Ruirui Zhang,Fanchen Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OptiCorNet提出了一种新的序列建模框架，结合空间特征提取和时间差分，通过端到端训练提升动态环境中的视觉地点识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态和感知混淆环境中视觉地点识别的挑战，现有方法忽视时间连贯性。

Method: 使用轻量级1D卷积编码器和可学习差分时间算子（DSD），结合LSTM和四元组损失优化。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中优于现有方法，尤其在季节和视角变化下表现优异。

Conclusion: OptiCorNet通过端到端学习序列级嵌入，显著提升了动态环境中的地点识别效果。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in dynamic and perceptually aliased
environments remains a fundamental challenge for long-term localization.
Existing deep learning-based solutions predominantly focus on single-frame
embeddings, neglecting the temporal coherence present in image sequences. This
paper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies
spatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable,
end-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D
convolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator,
termed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term
spatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models
directional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing
kernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection,
yielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance
shifts. To further enhance inter-class separability, we incorporate a
quadruplet loss that optimizes both positive alignment and multi-negative
divergence within each batch. Unlike prior VPR methods that treat temporal
aggregation as post-processing, OptiCorNet learns sequence-level embeddings
directly, enabling more effective end-to-end place recognition. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under challenging seasonal and viewpoint
variations.

*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Tian Zhang,Jianquan Liu,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFQ-ViT提出了一种无需数据的视觉变换器量化方法，通过合成样本和激活校正矩阵提升量化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在合成样本时未能平衡全局和局部特征，且量化模型与全精度模型的中间层激活分布差异大，导致性能下降。

Method: 按难度递增顺序合成样本，并引入激活校正矩阵对齐量化与全精度模型的中间层激活。

Result: DFQ-ViT性能优于现有DFQ方法，接近真实数据量化模型，如3位量化的DeiT-T性能提升4.29%。

Conclusion: DFQ-ViT无需微调，降低计算开销和部署门槛，符合绿色学习原则。

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers
(ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on
devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be
calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic
samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global
and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data
quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant
difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the
quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance
degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a
pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).
Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,
effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and
inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the
quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the
full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves
remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par
with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T
with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our
method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces
computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge
devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by
improving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in
resource-constrained environments.

*Hongye Hou,Liu Zhan,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强的点云补全框架，通过跨模态检索学习结构先验信息，生成细粒度点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完整点云补全任务中缺乏典型结构特征的问题，提升生成能力和泛化能力。

Method: 设计结构共享特征编码器（SSFE）提取跨模态特征，并采用渐进检索增强生成器（PRAG）分层融合参考先验信息。

Result: 在多数据集和真实场景中验证了方法的有效性，能够处理稀疏数据和未见类别。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成细粒度点云和泛化能力方面表现出色。

Abstract: Completing the whole 3D structure based on an incomplete point cloud is a
challenging task, particularly when the residual point cloud lacks typical
structural characteristics. Recent methods based on cross-modal learning
attempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.
However, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their
generation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented
point cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal
retrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from
similar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature
Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct
reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in
the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced
and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose
a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical
feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input
features from global to local. Through extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets and real-world scenes, our method shows its effectiveness in
generating fine-grained point clouds, as well as its generalization capability
in handling sparse data and unseen categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCP-LLaVA是一种新型多模态大语言模型，通过令牌压缩技术解决病理学全切片图像（WSI）的视觉问答（VQA）问题，显著降低计算成本并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学全切片图像（WSI）尺寸巨大，现有方法在生成能力和计算效率上存在不足，TCP-LLaVA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出TCP-LLaVA模型，利用可训练的压缩令牌通过模态压缩模块聚合视觉和文本信息，仅将压缩后的令牌输入语言模型。

Result: 在十种TCGA肿瘤亚型的实验中，TCP-LLaVA在VQA准确性上优于现有基线模型，并大幅减少训练资源消耗。

Conclusion: TCP-LLaVA为WSI的VQA任务提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000
pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model
(MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous
methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification
using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the
generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent
MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly
into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To
address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA
(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token
compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that
aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,
inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are
forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length
and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that
TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing
training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖光流或深度估计，而事件数据稀疏且高时间分辨率，结合几何约束可更高效处理运动分割和自运动估计。

Method: 采用优化流程，包括事件过分割、残差分析隔离独立运动物体，以及基于运动相似性和时间一致性的层次聚类细化分割。

Result: 在EVIMO2v2数据集上验证了方法在运动分割和平移运动估计中的准确性，尤其在物体边界表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时机器人和导航应用中具有显著潜力，尤其在处理稀疏事件数据时表现出优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces a robust framework for motion segmentation and
egomotion estimation using event-based normal flow, tailored specifically for
neuromorphic vision sensors. In contrast to traditional methods that rely
heavily on optical flow or explicit depth estimation, our approach exploits the
sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data and incorporates geometric
constraints between normal flow, scene structure, and inertial measurements.
The proposed optimization-based pipeline iteratively performs event
over-segmentation, isolates independently moving objects via residual analysis,
and refines segmentations using hierarchical clustering informed by motion
similarity and temporal consistency. Experimental results on the EVIMO2v2
dataset validate that our method achieves accurate segmentation and
translational motion estimation without requiring full optical flow
computation. This approach demonstrates significant advantages at object
boundaries and offers considerable potential for scalable, real-time robotic
and navigation applications.

vision, graphics, and immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR),
virtual reality (VR), and digital twins. Traditional methods rely on
computationally intensive iterative optimization in a complex chain, limiting

Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free
reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video
synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics,
and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed
statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We
conclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for
future work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance

Result: 显著减少了建模过程中的噪声，性能优于现有方法，并在挑战性场景中首次实现行人重建和多视角分割。

Conclusion: DCHM无需依赖人工标注，能有效提升行人检测的精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multiview pedestrian detection typically involves two stages: human modeling
and pedestrian localization. Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space
by fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection
accuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low
precision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D
annotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To
eliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we
propose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for
consistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates.
Specifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting
achieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded
scenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization.
Extensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise
during human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines.
Additionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians
and perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting. Code is
available on the \href{https://jiahao-ma.github.io/DCHM/}{project page}.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of educational applications, artistic creation, and
AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical
requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly
demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and
professional understanding. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA

Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first
expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main

Abstract: It has always been a rather tough task to communicate with someone possessing
a hearing impairment. One of the most tested ways to establish such a
communication is through the use of sign based languages. However, not many
people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign
language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the
communication barrier between deaf-mute and ordinary people so that they can
properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole
world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have
become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent
studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign
over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser
extension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for
everyone else in the video call. The Large-scale dataset which contains more
than 2000 Word-Level ASL videos, which were performed by over 100 signers will
be used.

Motivation: 解决情感认知科学中外部情绪刺激与人类内部体验关系的建模问题，尤其是探索ANN在捕捉个体感知差异方面的潜力。

Method: 提出一种新颖的感知边界采样方法，生成位于ANN决策边界的面部表情刺激，构建varEmotion数据集，并通过大规模人类行为实验验证假设。

Conclusion: 研究建立了ANN决策边界与人类感知变异性之间的系统性联系，为情绪解释的个性化建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in affective cognitive science is to develop models
that accurately capture the relationship between external emotional stimuli and
human internal experiences. While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in
facial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual
differences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates
the phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit
significant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same
stimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we
hypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN
classifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.
To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling
method to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision
boundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,
constructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments. Our analysis
reveals that these ANN-confusing stimuli also provoke heightened perceptual
uncertainty in human participants, highlighting shared computational principles
in emotion perception. Finally, by fine-tuning ANN representations using
behavioral data, we achieve alignment between ANN predictions and both
group-level and individual-level human perceptual patterns. Our findings
establish a systematic link between ANN decision boundaries and human
perceptual variability, offering new insights into personalized modeling of
emotional interpretation.

Motivation: 照片中的杂乱内容会分散注意力，影响情感或故事的传达，尤其是业余摄影师因经验不足容易忽略这一问题。

Result: 用户研究表明，该系统能帮助用户更高效地识别杂乱并提升照片质量。

Conclusion: 该系统通过灵活界面和准确算法，有效辅助用户改善摄影作品。

Abstract: Clutter in photos is a distraction preventing photographers from conveying
the intended emotions or stories to the audience. Photography amateurs
frequently include clutter in their photos due to unconscious negligence or the
lack of experience in creating a decluttered, aesthetically appealing scene for
shooting. We are thus motivated to develop a camera guidance system that
provides solutions and guidance for clutter identification and removal. We
estimate and visualize the contribution of objects to the overall aesthetics
and content of a photo, based on which users can interactively identify
clutter. Suggestions on getting rid of clutter, as well as a tool that removes
cluttered objects computationally, are provided to guide users to deal with
different kinds of clutter and improve their photographic work. Two technical
novelties underpin interactions in our system: a clutter distinguishment
algorithm with aesthetics evaluations for objects and an iterative image
inpainting algorithm based on generative adversarial nets that reconstructs
missing regions of removed objects for high-resolution images. User studies
demonstrate that our system provides flexible interfaces and accurate
algorithms that allow users to better identify distractions and take higher
quality images within less time.

Conclusion: Descrip3D通过语言增强的关系表示，显著提升了复杂室内场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires
reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D
scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,
particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles
and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and
powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects
using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D
embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that
captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These
relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level
integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for
unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and
question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional
supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,
Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms
strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided
relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.

Result: 在24个预训练模型和10个下游数据集上的实验表明，LEAD在低数据场景下仍表现优异。

Conclusion: LEAD通过单步优化填补优化差距，避免了冗长的微调过程，具有广泛适应性。

Abstract: The remarkable success of pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has led to a
proliferation of available pre-trained models for vision tasks. This surge
presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable
pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge
lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the
underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning
dynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely
align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential
nonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a
finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD
proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution
toward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware
decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes
and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned
optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the
differential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively
bridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning
process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised
pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive
performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: GAN在跨模态MRI图像合成中表现最佳，流匹配模型在小数据集上容易过拟合，未来研究可探索更多数据支持流匹配模型。代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image
contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering
distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities
increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods
for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize
missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time
while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides
a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM)
techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All
frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three
publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and
qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms
diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,
and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these
results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small
datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN
performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I
translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising
directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis. Code and
models are publicly available at

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis and monitoring.
Specifically, blood microscopy offers valuable insights into blood cell
morphology and the detection of hematological disorders. In recent years, deep
learning-based automated classification systems have demonstrated high

classifying blood cell images from the publicly available BloodMNIST dataset.
The study primarily focuses on inference time differences, but also
classification performance for different image sizes. The results reveal
variations in performance across frameworks, influenced by factors such as
image resolution and framework-specific optimizations. Classification accuracy
for JAX and PyTorch was comparable to current benchmarks, showcasing the

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction
applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing,
medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with
facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes
is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose
Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships
among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression
recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are
used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based
on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local
appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.
Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and
integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph
learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic
representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph
convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global
dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition
of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed
Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW.
The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%,
respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong
generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and
real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for
practical facial expression recognition applications.

TL;DR: 提出DD-SAM2框架，通过Depthwise-Dilated Adapter高效适配SAM2模型，用于医学视频分割与跟踪，减少计算成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法多为模态专用，适应性差，且SAM2在医学视频场景中需大规模数据集微调，成本高且易遗忘。

Method: 引入Depthwise-Dilated Adapter（DD-Adapter），增强多尺度特征提取，实现小数据高效微调。

Result: 在TrackRad2025和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上分别达到Dice分数0.93和0.97。

Conclusion: DD-SAM2为医学视频分割与跟踪提供高效适配方案，代码与模型将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep
learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific
designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a
streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new
opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting
these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets
for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and
the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose
DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a
Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective
fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike
existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully
exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and
segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation)
and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior
performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically
exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and
tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的进步增加了虚假信息的风险，现有单模态检测方法难以应对跨模态合成内容。

Method: 采用强化学习后训练策略，结合多阶段训练、思维奖励和混合推理，开发了BusterX++框架。

Result: 实验证明BusterX++在跨模态检测中表现优异，并具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: BusterX++为跨模态合成媒体检测提供了有效解决方案，并通过GenBuster++基准验证了其性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video
synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation
through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved
from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic
media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their
single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately,
making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media
formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel
framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of
synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning
(RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage
Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and
substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging
state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark
comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts
using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and
real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalizability of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型（SSM）的多光谱特征融合框架MS2Fusion，通过双路径参数交互机制解决现有方法在局部互补特征和跨模态共享语义之间的不足，显著提升了多光谱目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多光谱特征融合方法过度关注局部互补特征而忽视跨模态共享语义，且难以平衡感受野大小与计算复杂度，限制了泛化性能和可扩展性。

Method: MS2Fusion采用双路径参数交互机制：一路通过跨模态隐藏状态解码挖掘互补信息，另一路通过参数共享探索跨模态对齐的语义特征。两路径在SSM框架下联合优化。

Result: 在FLIR、M3FD和LLVIP等主流基准测试中，MS2Fusion显著优于其他先进方法，并在RGB-T语义分割和RGBT显著目标检测任务中表现出泛化能力。

Conclusion: MS2Fusion通过统一框架实现了功能互补和共享语义空间，为多光谱感知任务提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern multispectral feature fusion for object detection faces two critical
limitations: (1) Excessive preference for local complementary features over
cross-modal shared semantics adversely affects generalization performance; and
(2) The trade-off between the receptive field size and computational complexity
present critical bottlenecks for scalable feature modeling. Addressing these
issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed
MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving
efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction
mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch
inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information
with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter
branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain
cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing
in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing
multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy
both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive
experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our
MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object
detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general
and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even
without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T
semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its
generality. The source code will be available at
https://github.com/61s61min/MS2Fusion.git.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sports officiating
represents a paradigm shift in how decisions are made in competitive
environments. Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video
Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent
enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces
FST.ai, a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport
Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick
detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge
inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key
actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while
improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not
limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation,
motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of
sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team
sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance
tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging
scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability,
and sport-agnostic potential of FST.ai to transform officiating standards
across multiple disciplines.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模餐饮环境中的实时浪费跟踪系统奠定了基础，并提供了可行的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Quantifying post-consumer food waste in institutional dining settings is
essential for supporting data-driven sustainability strategies. This study
presents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level
food waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and
after meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models
(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped
dynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a
comprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a
custom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the
task. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at
least one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment
in pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter
counts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4
GPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more
rigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or
viscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically
post-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,
constrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is
pioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous
monitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for
automated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service
environments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future
directions for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce
institutional food waste.

Result: 在公共空间转录组数据集上，Gene-DML实现了最先进的基因表达预测性能。

Conclusion: Gene-DML通过联合建模细粒度和结构级判别，提升了跨模态表示的鲁棒性和预测准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a
scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant
implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However,
existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment
between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple
representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To
address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent
space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence
between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale
instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology
representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene
expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional
relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination
pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)
instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening
the alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and
structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal
representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across
diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial
transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art
performance in gene expression prediction. The code and checkpoints will be
released soon.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains
inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets.
While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial
solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts,
multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this
work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to
support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes
diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real
question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the
dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately
handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments
demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and
efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting
a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding. Data, code, and

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel
tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through
natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models.
Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to
balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains
underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we
propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal
WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust
task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific
accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task
allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch
and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through
internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge
bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the
final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on
multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs
and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: MIPD通过知识蒸馏有效提升了GSR模型的泛化和零样本能力，为复杂场景识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and
are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR
models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen
and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a
teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot
abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation
Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt
Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal
knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to
recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.
Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental
Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze
rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed
scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align
rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the
Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively
capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned
multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a
stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,
bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction
bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving
superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further
demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.

Abstract: Agricultural parcels serve as basic units for conducting agricultural
practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration,
food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing
agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or
regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced
terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we
introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global
Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset
covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex
terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution
images with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask
labels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and
transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing
datasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1)
terrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple
domain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks,
including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction,
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the
GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction
methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level
metrics. GTPBD fills a critical gap in terraced remote sensing research,
providing a basic infrastructure for fine-grained agricultural terrain analysis
and cross-scenario knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: MultiRetNet有望降低医疗成本，提高早期检测率，减少医疗资源分配不均，促进医疗公平。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness,
affecting over 100 million people worldwide. In the United States, individuals
from lower-income communities face a higher risk of progressing to advanced
stages before diagnosis, largely due to limited access to screening. Comorbid
conditions further accelerate disease progression. We propose MultiRetNet, a
novel pipeline combining retinal imaging, socioeconomic factors, and
comorbidity profiles to improve DR staging accuracy, integrated with a clinical
deferral system for a clinical human-in-the-loop implementation. We experiment
with three multimodal fusion methods and identify fusion through a fully
connected layer as the most versatile methodology. We synthesize adversarial,
low-quality images and use contrastive learning to train the deferral system,
guiding the model to identify out-of-distribution samples that warrant
clinician review. By maintaining diagnostic accuracy on suboptimal images and
integrating critical health data, our system can improve early detection,
particularly in underserved populations where advanced DR is often first
identified. This approach may reduce healthcare costs, increase early detection
rates, and address disparities in access to care, promoting healthcare equity.

Abstract: Traffic monitoring is crucial for urban mobility, road safety, and
intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced
video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA)
models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However,
existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic
scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal
dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct
VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models
for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of
real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into
10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering
spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other
critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on
InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained
spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally,
fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance
improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for

semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning
have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two
prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling
indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant
content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses
causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps
through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual
grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option
pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These
refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely
retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion
mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The
integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate
accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and
NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially
enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while
maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: FOCUS框架解决了Vision Transformers在HSI数据中解释性不足的问题，通过类特定光谱提示和[SINK]令牌，实现了高效且稳定的3D显著性映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI数据的高维性和现有显著性方法无法捕捉有意义的频谱线索，导致ViTs在HSI中的解释性不足。

Method: FOCUS引入类特定光谱提示和[SINK]令牌，通过单次前向传递生成3D显著性映射和频谱重要性曲线。

Result: FOCUS提高了波段级IoU 15%，减少注意力崩溃40%，且结果与专家标注高度一致。

Conclusion: FOCUS以不到1%的参数开销，为HSI应用提供了实用的ViT解释性方法。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous
wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and
environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in
this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing
saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing
attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally
prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI
data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient
spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core
components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward
semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained
with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these
designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps
and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient
backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15
percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency
results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent
parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability
practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing
gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.

*Wenbo Yue,Chang Li,Guoping Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息互补的下采样方法HPD，用于解决传统下采样方法在语义分割任务中丢失关键空间信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下采样方法（如最大池化和跨行卷积）在特征聚合、感受野扩展和计算量减少方面表现良好，但在语义分割任务中可能导致关键空间信息丢失，影响像素级预测精度。

Method: 提出Hybrid Pooling Downsampling (HPD)方法，用MinMaxPooling替代传统方法，通过提取局部区域的最大值信息，有效保留图像的明暗对比和细节特征。

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上的实验表明，HPD在分割性能上优于传统方法，平均DSC系数提高0.5%。

Conclusion: HPD模块为语义分割任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), downsampling operations are crucial
to model performance. Although traditional downsampling methods (such as
maximum pooling and cross-row convolution) perform well in feature aggregation,
receptive field expansion, and computational reduction, they may lead to the
loss of key spatial information in semantic segmentation tasks, thereby
affecting the pixel-by-pixel prediction accuracy.To this end, this study
proposes a downsampling method based on information complementarity - Hybrid
Pooling Downsampling (HPD). The core is to replace the traditional method with
MinMaxPooling, and effectively retain the light and dark contrast and detail
features of the image by extracting the maximum value information of the local
area.Experiment on various CNN architectures on the ACDC and Synapse datasets
show that HPD outperforms traditional methods in segmentation performance, and
increases the DSC coefficient by 0.5% on average. The results show that the HPD
module provides an efficient solution for semantic segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EPD的新型ODE求解器，通过并行梯度评估减少截断误差，实现高质量低延迟采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型因顺序去噪导致高延迟，现有加速方法在低延迟下图像质量下降。

Method: EPD通过并行梯度评估优化ODE步长，参数可学习且可并行化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EPD在5 NFE下FID显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EPD是一种高效插件式方法，显著提升扩散模型的采样质量和速度。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance
but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature.
Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation
under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel
Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates
truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in
each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are
independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling.
  Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation
fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead.
  In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE
samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and
low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD
achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26
on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant
margin. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/EPD.

Motivation: 探索基于Transformer的3D重建模型在航拍图像中的潜力，尤其是处理稀疏重叠、遮挡和无纹理区域的能力。

Method: 在UseGeo数据集的航拍图像块上评估预训练的DUSt3R、MASt3R和VGGT模型，进行姿态估计和密集3D重建。

Result: 这些模型能从极稀疏图像集（少于10张）中重建密集点云，完整性比COLMAP提高50%，VGGT计算效率更高。但高分辨率和大图像集时姿态估计可靠性下降。

Conclusion: Transformer方法无法完全替代传统SfM和MVS，但在低分辨率、稀疏场景中可作为补充。

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in
handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models
for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction
(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to
handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical
aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,
stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can
accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite
tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric
aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of
the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results
show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very
sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with
completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher
computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose
estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and
large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric
complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully
replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches,
especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.

Conclusion: 框架具有有效性、可扩展性和潜力，可作为通用低层视觉建模基础。

Abstract: Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image
restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ
significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the
challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual
task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target
image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of
low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing
backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible
integration with various architectures and effective utilization of
task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a
unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across
multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we
extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity.
We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision
tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of
training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited
data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations
through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization,
few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the
model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and
potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general
low-level vision modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法在单脸检测中表现良好，但在多脸场景中因缺乏上下文线索而表现不佳，需借鉴人类认知提升检测能力。

Method: 通过人类研究识别四种关键线索（场景运动一致性、脸间外观兼容性、人际注视对齐和脸身一致性），并基于此设计HICOM框架。

Result: HICOM在基准数据集上平均准确率提升3.3%，在真实扰动下提升2.8%，在未见数据集上优于现有方法5.8%。

Conclusion: 通过结合人类认知线索，HICOM显著提升了多脸深度伪造检测的准确性和可解释性，为防御深度伪造提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often
appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods.
Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in
multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In
this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to
analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of
human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in
social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely
on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal
gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we
introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face
in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that
\textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and
2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods
by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired
cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM
to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more
transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to
enhance defense against deepfakes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来运动轨迹对机器人、自动驾驶等领域至关重要，现有视频预测模型计算量大且延迟高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用改进的InstructPix2Pix模型，结合视觉和文本输入，预测未来100帧（10秒）的机器人观察画面。

Result: 在RoboTWin数据集上，该方法在SSIM和PSNR指标上优于现有基线模型，且仅需单张图像和文本输入。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，适用于对运动轨迹精度要求高的场景，如机器人和运动分析。

Abstract: Predicting future motion trajectories is a critical capability across domains
such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling
safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel,
efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering
significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to
conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation
of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic
tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep
learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will
observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a
textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to
accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame
prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world
scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared
to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike
conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy
computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image
and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,
reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for
applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion
trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.

Motivation: 扩散模型计算密集，部署在资源受限或延迟敏感环境中存在挑战。现有PTQ方法依赖特定架构启发式，通用性不足。

Method: 提出SegQuant框架，包含SegLinear（段感知图量化策略）和DualScale（双尺度量化方案），保留视觉保真度。

Result: SegQuant在Transformer以外的扩散模型中表现优异，兼容主流部署工具。

Conclusion: SegQuant为扩散模型提供了一种高效、通用的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but
are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an
effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training
quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with
pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However,
existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific
heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with
industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines
complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists
of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures
structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale
quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations,
which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant
is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving
strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream
deployment tools.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in chart

structures and domain-specific terminology, remain notably underexplored. We
introduce FinChart-Bench, the first benchmark specifically focused on
real-world financial charts. FinChart-Bench comprises 1,200 financial chart
images collected from 2015 to 2024, each annotated with True/False (TF),
Multiple Choice (MC), and Question Answering (QA) questions, totaling 7,016
questions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LVLMs
on FinChart-Bench. Our evaluation reveals critical insights: (1) the
performance gap between open-source and closed-source models is narrowing, (2)
performance degradation occurs in upgraded models within families, (3) many
models struggle with instruction following, (4) both advanced models show
significant limitations in spatial reasoning abilities, and (5) current LVLMs
are not reliable enough to serve as automated evaluators. These findings

Conclusion: PHATNet通过灵活的域适应方法，有效提升了去雾模型在未见域上的性能。

Abstract: Image dehazing aims to remove unwanted hazy artifacts in images. Although
previous research has collected paired real-world hazy and haze-free images to
improve dehazing models' performance in real-world scenarios, these models
often experience significant performance drops when handling unseen real-world
hazy images due to limited training data. This issue motivates us to develop a
flexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during
testing. Observing that predicting haze patterns is generally easier than
recovering clean content, we propose the Physics-guided Haze Transfer Network
(PHATNet) which transfers haze patterns from unseen target domains to
source-domain haze-free images, creating domain-specific fine-tuning sets to
update dehazing models for effective domain adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce a Haze-Transfer-Consistency loss and a Content-Leakage Loss to
enhance PHATNet's disentanglement ability. Experimental results demonstrate
that PHATNet significantly boosts state-of-the-art dehazing models on benchmark
real-world image dehazing datasets.

Abstract: The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images
is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the
high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,
which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there
is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly
used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.
First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to
learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality
of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,
existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding
annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in
supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.
The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation
of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional
diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices
and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training
process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show
that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.
Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus
enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 新方法解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了深度补全的效果。

Abstract: Depth completion is an important vision task, and many efforts have been made
to enhance the quality of depth maps from sparse depth measurements. Despite
significant advances, training these models to recover dense depth from sparse
measurements remains a challenging problem. Supervised learning methods rely on
dense depth labels to predict unobserved regions, while self-supervised
approaches require image sequences to enforce geometric constraints and
photometric consistency between frames. However, acquiring dense annotations is
costly, and multi-frame dependencies limit the applicability of self-supervised
methods in static or single-frame scenarios. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel self-supervised depth completion paradigm that requires only
sparse depth measurements and their corresponding image for training. Unlike
existing methods, our approach eliminates the need for dense depth labels or
additional images captured from neighboring viewpoints. By leveraging the
characteristics of depth distribution, we design novel loss functions that
effectively propagate depth information from observed points to unobserved
regions. Additionally, we incorporate segmentation maps generated by vision
foundation models to further enhance depth estimation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-in-one video restoration framework that
grounds degradation-aware semantic context of video frames in natural language
via foundation models, offering interpretable and flexible guidance. Unlike
prior art, our method assumes no degradation knowledge in train or test time
and learns an approximation to the grounded knowledge such that the foundation
model can be safely disentangled during inference adding no extra cost.
Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video
restoration, and propose two benchmarks in multi-degradation setting,
three-task (3D) and four-task (4D), and two time-varying composite degradation
benchmarks; one of the latter being our proposed dataset with varying snow
intensity, simulating how weather degradations affect videos naturally. We
compare our method with prior works and report state-of-the-art performance on
all benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of object detection with a focus on
improving both the localization accuracy of bounding boxes and explicitly
modeling prediction uncertainty. Conventional detectors rely on deterministic
bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model
robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement
framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as
multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth
distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter
high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a
simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.
Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively
integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further
extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability
of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks. Code

Abstract: Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the
emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the
fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging
topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not
been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion
states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with
a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the
framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately
designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale
temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion
of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations
for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further
propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges
between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of
body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the
relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an
emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow
architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is
jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing
self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is
evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and
achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the
existing methods.

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of foundation models for depth prediction has
led to remarkable progress, particularly in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their
outputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation
poses challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address
this, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation
models to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as
they require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,
fine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization
capabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,
we introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth
measurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into
metric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,
thereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation
models while enabling them to produce metric depth. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, high-lighting its potential to
bridge the gap between relative and metric depth without incurring additional
computational costs or sacrificing generalization ability.

Motivation: rPPG技术需要在大规模多样化数据集上实现有效泛化，而手工方法虽然计算高效但性能受限，深度学习则能提取更复杂的脉动信息。因此需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出BeatFormer，一种轻量级光谱注意力模型，结合了正交复数注意力和频域能量测量，并引入谱对比学习（SCL）实现无标签训练。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG和MMPD数据集上验证了BeatFormer的鲁棒性和性能，尤其在跨数据集运动场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: BeatFormer通过结合手工方法和深度学习的优势，提供了一种高效且鲁棒的rPPG估计方法，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) captures cardiac signals from facial
videos and is gaining attention for its diverse applications. While deep
learning has advanced rPPG estimation, it relies on large, diverse datasets for
effective generalization. In contrast, handcrafted methods utilize
physiological priors for better generalization in unseen scenarios like motion
while maintaining computational efficiency. However, their linear assumptions
limit performance in complex conditions, where deep learning provides superior
pulsatile information extraction. This highlights the need for hybrid
approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. To address this, we
present BeatFormer, a lightweight spectral attention model for rPPG estimation,
which integrates zoomed orthonormal complex attention and frequency-domain
energy measurement, enabling a highly efficient model. Additionally, we
introduce Spectral Contrastive Learning (SCL), which allows BeatFormer to be
trained without any PPG or HR labels. We validate BeatFormer on the PURE,
UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, demonstrating its robustness and performance,
particularly in cross-dataset evaluations under motion scenarios.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information
in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for
embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on
separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D
point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to
train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP
for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D
encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for
feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training
inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal
network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),
significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal
model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the
tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across
modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module
is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and
images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and
introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.
Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the
three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to
the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by
approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection
task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语义感知表示学习（SARL）方法，用于多标签图像分类，通过语义相关特征学习和最优传输注意力机制提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如注意力机制或图卷积网络）在图像表示中可能存在噪声且定位不精确，因此需要更精确的语义对齐表示。

Method: 1. 使用标签语义相关特征学习模块提取语义特征；2. 设计基于最优传输的注意力机制实现语义对齐；3. 采用区域分数聚合策略进行多标签预测。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和MS-COCO数据集上的实验表明，SARL优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARL通过语义对齐和噪声抑制，显著提升了多标签图像分类的准确性。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification, an important research area in computer
vision, focuses on identifying multiple labels or concepts within an image.
Existing approaches often employ attention mechanisms or graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to learn image representation. However, this representation may
contain noise and may not locate objects precisely. Therefore, this paper
proposes a Semantic-Aware Representation Learning (SARL) for multi-label image
classification. First, a label semantic-related feature learning module is
utilized to extract semantic-related features. Then, an optimal transport-based
attention mechanism is designed to obtain semantically aligned image
representation. Finally, a regional score aggregation strategy is used for
multi-label prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL
VOC 2007 and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of SARL over existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D高斯几何和外观预测上耦合紧密，依赖数据驱动先验且回归速度慢，计算资源需求高。

Method: 使用立体视觉骨干网络提取局部图像对特征，通过全局注意力块融合，生成多视点点图和外观高斯特征，结合为GS图表示3DGS对象，并通过细化网络提升重建质量。

Result: 实现了无姿态的高质量3D重建，减少了资源需求，提升了鲁棒性和实用性。

Conclusion: \method为实际3D内容生成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction showcases advanced
Image-to-3D content creation but requires substantial computational resources
and large datasets, posing challenges to training models from scratch. Current
methods usually entangle the prediction of 3D Gaussian geometry and appearance,
which rely heavily on data-driven priors and result in slow regression speeds.
To address this, we propose \method, a disentangled framework for efficient 3D
Gaussian prediction. Our method extracts features from local image pairs using
a stereo vision backbone and fuses them via global attention blocks. Dedicated
point and Gaussian prediction heads generate multi-view point-maps for geometry
and Gaussian features for appearance, combined as GS-maps to represent the 3DGS
object. A refinement network enhances these GS-maps for high-quality
reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that depend on camera parameters, our
approach achieves pose-free 3D reconstruction, improving robustness and
practicality. By reducing resource demands while maintaining high-quality
outputs, \method provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-world 3D
content generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多维尺度分析（MDS）和鲁棒优化的方法，用于低温电子显微镜（cryo-EM）中的姿态估计和位移校正，显著提高了3D重建的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低温电子显微镜（cryo-EM）中的低信噪比（SNR）导致姿态估计和位移校正困难，直接影响3D重建的准确性。

Method: 结合MDS技术和鲁棒优化框架（如ℓ₁范数），同时估计旋转轴和平面内向量，并通过迭代位移校正算法优化全局平移。

Result: 该方法在欧拉角精度和重建保真度（通过傅里叶壳层相关性FSC衡量）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒优化和全局校正框架显著提升了低SNR条件下的姿态估计和3D重建质量。

Abstract: Accurate pose estimation and shift correction are key challenges in cryo-EM
due to the very low SNR, which directly impacts the fidelity of 3D
reconstructions. We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that
leverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to
estimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.
We express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit
vector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the
concept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common
line estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM
projection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary
components: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based
on an $\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously
estimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm
and orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an
iterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane
translations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches
have leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation
recovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\ell_2$-based objectives
that are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only
approximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,
can lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR
regimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler
angle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell
Correlation (FSC).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概率框架，用于多实例学习（MIL）中的注意力机制，通过估计注意力值的概率分布，提升医学图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法在处理医学图像时，注意力机制确定性较强，可能忽略实例贡献的不确定性，需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 提出概率框架，估计注意力值的分布，同时考虑全局和局部交互。

Result: 在三个医学数据集和十一种基线方法对比中，表现最优，且提供可解释的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 概率框架显著提升了MIL在医学图像分类中的性能，并增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of
attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL
methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide
images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training.
Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating
instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the
bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions
among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various
mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially
overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this
work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability
distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local
interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven}
state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our
approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover,
the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are
interpretable in terms of illness localization.

Conclusion: MICU能有效提升开放集跨模态泛化能力，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: This paper extends Cross Modal Generalization (CMG) to open-set environments
by proposing the more challenging Open-set Cross Modal Generalization (OSCMG)
task. This task evaluates multimodal unified representations in open-set
conditions, addressing the limitations of prior closed-set cross-modal
evaluations. OSCMG requires not only cross-modal knowledge transfer but also
robust generalization to unseen classes within new modalities, a scenario
frequently encountered in real-world applications. Existing multimodal unified
representation work lacks consideration for open-set environments. To tackle
this, we propose MICU, comprising two key components: Fine-Coarse Masked
multimodal InfoNCE (FCMI) and Cross modal Unified Jigsaw Puzzles (CUJP). FCMI
enhances multimodal alignment by applying contrastive learning at both holistic
semantic and temporal levels, incorporating masking to enhance generalization.
CUJP enhances feature diversity and model uncertainty by integrating
modality-agnostic feature selection with self-supervised learning, thereby
strengthening the model's ability to handle unknown categories in open-set
tasks. Extensive experiments on CMG and the newly proposed OSCMG validate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嵌入式设备在实时多标签视频分类中面临计算和能源限制，而视频流的结构特性（如标签稀疏性、时间连续性和标签共现）可被利用以提高效率。

Method: Polymorph框架动态激活每帧所需的轻量级低秩适配器（LoRA），这些适配器专用于基于共现模式的子类，避免了全模型切换和权重合并。

Result: 在TAO数据集上，Polymorph降低了40%的能耗，并将mAP提高了9个百分点。

Conclusion: Polymorph通过模块化策略显著提升了嵌入式设备上的视频分类效率和性能。

Abstract: Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained
by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural
properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence
that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a
context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank
Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes
derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a
shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only
the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching
and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing
latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption
and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset.

Conclusion: 本文提出的深度学习框架为低重叠PCR任务提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了配准性能。

Abstract: Low-overlap point cloud registration (PCR) remains a significant challenge in
3D vision. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as Maximum Inlier Count, become
ineffective under extremely low inlier ratios. In this paper, we revisit the
registration result evaluation problem and identify the Decision version of the
PCR task as the fundamental problem. To address this Decision PCR task, we
propose a data-driven approach. First, we construct a corresponding dataset
based on the 3DMatch dataset. Then, a deep learning-based classifier is trained
to reliably assess registration quality, overcoming the limitations of
traditional metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to
address this task through a deep learning framework. We incorporate this
classifier into standard PCR pipelines. When integrated with our approach,
existing state-of-the-art PCR methods exhibit significantly enhanced
registration performance. For example, combining our framework with
GeoTransformer achieves a new SOTA registration recall of 86.97\% on the
challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark. Our method also demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities on the unseen outdoor ETH dataset.

Conclusion: HiCroPL通过分层跨模态交互有效解决了模态隔离和语义衰减问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent
generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to
downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains
challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer
from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality
isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,
we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that
establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,
enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge
flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early
layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts
through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of
low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific
task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper
alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations
at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain
transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further
introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient
cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate
HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11
benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 语义提示信息对MLLMs在多模态回归任务中至关重要，强调了有意义文本上下文的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based
regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods
fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts
(e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating
behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over
image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts
perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic
understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based
Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification
with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address
discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates
manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only
images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts
dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts
containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage
cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to
prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We
demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that
MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical
biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual
context in multimodal regression tasks.

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和预处理策略显著提升了文档去扭曲的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Document dewarping is crucial for many applications. However, existing
learning-based methods primarily rely on supervised regression with annotated
data without leveraging the inherent geometric properties in physical documents
to the dewarping process. Our key insight is that a well-dewarped document is
characterized by transforming distorted feature lines into axis-aligned ones.
This property aligns with the inherent axis-aligned nature of the discrete grid
geometry in planar documents. In the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned
geometric constraint to enhance document dewarping. In the inference phase, we
propose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping
difficulty. In the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned
Distortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with
human visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result,
our method achieves SOTA results on multiple existing benchmarks and achieves
18.2%~34.5% improvements on the AAD metric.

Abstract: Accurately identifying and representing object edges is a challenging task in
computer vision and image processing. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has
significantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high
memory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in
real-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything
(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM
often generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.
Therefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline
curve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the
robust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a
four-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed
to effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the
visual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising
critical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical
utility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential
for FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial
automation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and
efficient edge recognition is crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能充分反映视频LLMs在正确性和鲁棒性方面与人类智能的差距，尤其是在复杂视觉叙事和对抗性问题下的表现。

Method: 提出Video-TT，包含1000个YouTube Shorts视频，每个视频配有一个开放式问题和四个对抗性问题，以测试视觉和叙事复杂性。

Result: 评估显示视频LLMs与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: Video-TT揭示了视频LLMs在复杂视频理解和对抗性问题处理上的不足，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Human intelligence requires correctness and robustness, with the former being
foundational for the latter. In video understanding, correctness ensures the
accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent
performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language
models (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between
these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness
in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to
assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans.
Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and
evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises
1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four
adversarial questions that probe visual and narrative complexity. Our
evaluation shows a significant gap between video LLMs and human performance.

Conclusion: OpenBreastUS为开发创新神经PDE求解器并应用于实际医学成像问题提供了平台。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in
computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography
(USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered
waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally
intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for
quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative
approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their
effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets
oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a
large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between
theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes
8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million
frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a
comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward
simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,
scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and
extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing
innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in
real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate
efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像增强对海洋保护至关重要，但现有AI模型存在数据集偏差、高计算成本和缺乏透明度的问题，可能导致误解。

Method: EBA-AI利用CLIP嵌入检测和缓解数据集偏差，并采用自适应处理优化能效，显著减少GPU使用。

Conclusion: EBA-AI在效率、公平性和可解释性方面表现优异，为可持续的海洋保护提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement is vital for marine conservation, particularly
coral reef monitoring. However, AI-based enhancement models often face dataset
bias, high computational costs, and lack of transparency, leading to potential
misinterpretations. This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware
AI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to
detect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across
varied underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to
optimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining
competitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100
show that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable
real-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,
uncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven
environmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,
WaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing
efficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing. By
addressing key limitations of AI-driven enhancement, this work contributes to
sustainable, bias-aware, and computationally efficient marine conservation
efforts. For interactive visualizations, animations, source code, and access to

Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿技术存在跨领域泛化能力不足或数据偏差问题，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出服装先验生成机制和连续边界缝合技术以保留细节，利用DDIM反演实现精确姿势对齐。

Result: 实验表明OmniVTON在多种数据集和场景中表现优异，首次实现多人虚拟试穿。

Conclusion: OmniVTON通过解耦服装和姿势约束，解决了扩散模型在多条件处理中的偏差问题。

Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) techniques rely on either supervised
in-shop approaches, which ensure high fidelity but struggle with cross-domain
generalization, or unsupervised in-the-wild methods, which improve adaptability
but remain constrained by data biases and limited universality. A unified,
training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open
challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON
framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture
fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment
details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing
with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve
fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM
inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,
ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By
disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias
inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance
across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it
is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment
transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene. Code is available at

Motivation: 针对当前全色锐化领域模型庞大、计算开销高且泛化性差的问题，提出更高效、通用的解决方案。

Method: 设计轻量级单步框架PanTiny，采用多数据集（WV2、WV3、GF2）联合训练和复合损失函数。

Result: PanTiny在性能和效率上优于大型专用模型，显著提升全分辨率数据的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过模型设计、训练范式和损失函数的优化，证明了轻量高效模型可超越暴力扩展，推动领域向高效通用方向发展。

Abstract: The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly
large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets.
This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor
generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper.
In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step
pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance.
More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a
single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite
datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral
information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only
simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on
full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite
loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for
pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny
model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior
performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized
models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled
engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass
brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards
creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for
pan-sharpening. The code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 当前的人体图像动画扩散模型在参考图像和驱动视频差异较大时难以保持身份一致性。

Method: StableAnimator++ 结合了可学习的姿态对齐模块、全局内容感知的人脸编码器和分布感知的 ID 适配器，并通过 HJB 优化在推理阶段提升面部保真度。

Result: 实验证明 StableAnimator++ 在定性和定量上均表现出色。

Conclusion: StableAnimator++ 通过创新的模块设计和优化策略，显著提升了身份一致性和生成视频的质量。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain
identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving
video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce
StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with
learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned
on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building
upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed
modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In
particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the
similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven
poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These
matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating
misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face
embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a
global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a
distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal
layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference
stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization
integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for
enhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of
StableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本图像在现代电子社会中具有独特重要性，但生成和编辑文本图像的复杂性仍是一个挑战。研究旨在评估现有生成模型是否能掌握这一任务。

Method: 通过将33个典型OCR任务分为五类，对六种模型进行全面评估，使用高质量图像输入和提示。

Result: 研究发现现有模型在OCR任务中存在不足，并提出了将文本图像生成和编辑作为通用生成模型基础技能的建议。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁将文本图像生成和编辑内化为通用生成模型的基础能力，而非依赖专门解决方案。

Abstract: Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual
aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety
and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and
evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of
specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative
models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a
natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and
editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative
models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We
incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our
evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR
generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into
five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and
complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six
models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,
high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial
observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR
tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be
internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,
rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this
empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve
this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our
GitHub repository.

Result: LASED训练模型召回率显著提升，可转向CNN比传统CNN平均提高12%召回率。

Conclusion: 结合大规模数据集和可转向CNN，显著增强了无人机视觉地点识别的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse
environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique
challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude
datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational
ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a
large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,
systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a
decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured
design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training
for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,
leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,
orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking
demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall
compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the
benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover,
steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial
imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures,
achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing
non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with
rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model
robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.

Motivation: 解决当前AI方法在ESD中仅关注出血区域分割，而忽略出血源检测和动态跟踪的问题。

Method: 引入BleedOrigin-Bench数据集和BleedOrigin-Net双阶段检测-跟踪框架。

Result: 在出血起始检测、初始源检测和点跟踪方面均达到先进性能。

Conclusion: BleedOrigin-Net在ESD中实现了高效的出血源定位与跟踪，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses
significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous
monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In
particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only
milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs
operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence
(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the
critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in
the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual
obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of
specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first
comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated
bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with
39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6
challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel
dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in
ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection
to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection
models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking
methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset
detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source
detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) loop closure problem is the recognition of previously visited places. In
this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop
closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the
embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the
classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic
visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is
designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an
index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction
quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors,
LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep
learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is

Conclusion: VideoPlan方法有效解决了视觉规划中的关键挑战，展现了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user
actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the
user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon
visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in
training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural
annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics
effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to
explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when
compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce
Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks
relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to
augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured
action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token
Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads
to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,
achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,
surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3
future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term
Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art
approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made
available.

Conclusion: 结构化图建模有效提升了异步视觉任务的性能，证明了方法的优越性。

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by
generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data
into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these
inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such
methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance
on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal
changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph
leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal
graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This
design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally
expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM
datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in
detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup,
reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results
highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous
vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.

Conclusion: MeshMamba及其衍生模型在3D人体网格生成和重建任务中表现出高效性和扩展性，为复杂场景提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MeshMamba, a neural network model for learning 3D
articulated mesh models by employing the recently proposed Mamba State Space
Models (Mamba-SSMs). MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large
number of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh
models with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.
The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of
mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is
achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D
vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the
structure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,
a denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)
Mamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape
and pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can
generate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and
outperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.
Additionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric
human mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses
using around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,
while achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for
feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven
especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending
generative models. However, generative models perform better in image
generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a
connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the
representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by
approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a
semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for
recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the
diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition
model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of
mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to
incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked
tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to
further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study
to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes
will be released soon in public.

Abstract: Advancements in 3D vision have increased the impact of blood vessel modeling
on medical applications. However, accurately representing the complex geometry
and topology of blood vessels remains a challenge due to their intricate
branching patterns, curvatures, and irregular shapes. In this study, we propose
a hierarchical part-based frame work for 3D vessel generation that separates
the global binary tree-like topology from local geometric details. Our approach
proceeds in three stages: (1) key graph generation to model the overall
hierarchical struc ture, (2) vessel segment generation conditioned on geometric
properties, and (3) hierarchical vessel assembly by integrating the local
segments according to the global key graph. We validate our framework on real
world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in
modeling complex vascular networks. This work marks the first successful
application of a part-based generative approach for 3D vessel modeling, setting
a new benchmark for vascular data generation. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像等高风险领域，模型决策的可解释性对临床应用至关重要。本文旨在通过SAE方法提升乳腺影像模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）分析预训练的乳腺影像-语言基础模型Mammo-CLIP，识别与临床特征相关的潜在特征。

Result: 研究发现SAE潜在空间中的激活神经元与真实区域一致，并揭示了影响模型决策的混杂因素。

Conclusion: SAE潜在表示有望为乳腺影像基础模型的内部机制提供更深入的理解。

Abstract: Interpretability is critical in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging,
where understanding model decisions is essential for clinical adoption. In this
work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast
imaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model
pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level
\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features
associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and
\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class
level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground
truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the
model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons
the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast
concept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE
latent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings
of foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Coalescent Projection（CP）的新方法，结合自监督变换（SSTs）生成伪类，解决了CD-FSL中因参数过多导致的过拟合问题，并在BSCD-FSL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CD-FSL方法在参数更新过多时容易因样本稀缺而过拟合，需要一种更有效的方法来应对这一挑战。

Method: 提出CP作为软提示的替代方案，结合SSTs生成伪类，仅依赖基础域数据为网络适应新域样本做准备。

Result: 在BSCD-FSL极端域偏移场景下，该方法表现优异。

Conclusion: CP与SSTs的结合为CD-FSL提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the progress in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), a model
pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the
latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that
updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to
the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new
concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.
Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with
Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to
prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The
proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the
extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published

Result: 实验表明，FreeCus在零样本主题合成中达到或超越需训练的方法，且兼容现有修复和控制模块。

Conclusion: FreeCus成功解锁DiT的零样本能力，为高保真主题驱动合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,
particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are
increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that
preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design
workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require
either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training
specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.
Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their
practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully
leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers
(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this
gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates
DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal
attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while
preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis
of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly
improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic
representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully
unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse
contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to
approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework
demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and
control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于近似盲PnP的对应学习方法MinCD-PnP，通过最小化学习到的2D和3D关键点之间的Chamfer距离来优化I2P配准，解决了传统微分PnP对噪声和异常值敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微分PnP在图像到点云（I2P）配准中对噪声和异常值敏感，影响了对应学习的有效性。受盲PnP的鲁棒性启发，作者提出了近似盲PnP方法。

Method: 提出MinCD-PnP方法，将盲PnP简化为最小化学习到的2D和3D关键点之间的Chamfer距离，并设计轻量级多任务学习模块MinCD-Net。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，MinCD-Net在跨场景和跨数据集设置中均优于现有方法，具有更高的内点比率（IR）和配准召回率（RR）。

Conclusion: MinCD-PnP和MinCD-Net有效解决了I2P配准中的噪声和异常值问题，提升了配准性能。

Abstract: Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer
vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a
point cloud. The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to
supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on
2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise
and outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the
effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind
PnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated
blind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high
computational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of
minimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called
MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task
learning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the
existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,
RGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)
and registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.

Motivation: 基于条件扩散模型在人类视觉感知对齐方面的优势，探索其在视频压缩中的应用。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：多粒度条件捕捉、紧凑表示设计、多条件训练。

Result: 在感知质量指标（如FVD和LPIPS）上显著优于传统和神经编解码器，尤其在高压缩比下。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型在视频压缩中具有巨大潜力，能够实现感知优化的高效重建。

Abstract: Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at
reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on
this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages
conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.
Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,
where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative
signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular
conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic
spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient
transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition
training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent
over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and
neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance
(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

Motivation: 随着生物识别系统检测技术的进步，攻击手段也日益复杂，传统深度学习模型在适应新型攻击或环境变化时表现不佳，且需要大量训练数据。

Method: 提出了一种基于开源视觉语言模型（VLM）的上下文学习框架，用于检测物理和数字攻击。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在物理和数字攻击检测中表现优异，优于某些传统CNN模型，且无需资源密集型训练。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升攻击检测的泛化能力提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the
detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection
methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks
on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital
approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence
against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in
scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to
different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These
subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable
performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,
including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse
attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the
application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning
framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing
attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first
systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in
security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is
established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available
databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive
performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of
the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental
results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving
generalisation in attack detection.

Motivation: 解决指纹识别在多样化采集条件下鲁棒性和准确性的挑战。

Result: 在多种指纹数据集上实现了最先进的准确性和高效性。

Conclusion: DMD方法在指纹识别中表现出强大的泛化能力和应用潜力。

Abstract: Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental
challenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance
in such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense
representation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and
discriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.
Specifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and
oriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where
two dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the
third encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures
abstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained
description that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their
surrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial
correspondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground
segmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,
comparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving
efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,
contactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,
showing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition. Corresponding
code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Yy/DMD.

Motivation: 当前少样本目标检测方法在有限训练样本下难以准确提取有效特征，表现为高权重通道未必有效，低权重通道可能仍有价值。

Method: 设计了SCSM模块，包含空间特征建模（SFM）和基于Mamba的通道状态建模（CSM），以平衡空间与通道关系学习。

Result: 在VOC和COCO数据集上的实验表明，SCSM模块显著提升了特征表示质量，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SCSM模块通过建模通道间相关性，有效解决了FSOD中的特征提取问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we
observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective
features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:
i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)
channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this
problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the
novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can
correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since
the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal
sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel
sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space
Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the
effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In
SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the
learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce
the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in
channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM
module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature
representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse
applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth
foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to
inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on
alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth
representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose
BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected
downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular
feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial
understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses
DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing
problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and
provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work
sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model
evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth
estimation.

Conclusion: ExDD通过双重分布建模和合成数据生成，显著提升了工业缺陷检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined
to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier
distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing
environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework
that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature
distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the
distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns,
addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual
conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve
industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly
fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting
both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.
Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%
I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.

high variability in defect appearances across different road conditions. We
propose RoadFusion, a framework that addresses these limitations through
synthetic anomaly generation with dual-path feature adaptation. A latent

Abstract: The state of the art in human-centric computer vision achieves high accuracy
and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in
this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large
datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but
high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher
efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of
detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data
provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also
provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address
unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real
input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction
tasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground
segmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and
inference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy. Our

Conclusion: ORSANet有效解决了遮挡和数据集偏差问题，提升了FER的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive
occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially
occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,
leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which
introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary
multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn
high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic
segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced
facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric
prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.
Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal
priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively
fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within
different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement
Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,
further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We
further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate
specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,
dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER
demonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a crucial role in surgical workflow
analysis, enabling various applications such as surgical monitoring, skill
assessment, and workflow optimization. Despite significant advancements in deep
learning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently
opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of
interpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To
address this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation
framework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition
models by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we
introduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for
neurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,
associating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for
predictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition
models, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction. This
highlights the potential of our method in explaining surgical phase
recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SurgX

Motivation: 第一人称视频（egomotion）是具身AI代理的主要视觉输入，但现有方法计算成本高且未充分利用其时空连续性，因此需要更高效的推理方法。

Method: EgoPrune包含三个组件：关键帧选择器、视角感知冗余过滤（PARF）和基于最大边际相关性（MMR）的令牌选择器。

Result: 在两个第一人称视频基准测试中，EgoPrune在多种修剪比例下均优于现有方法，显著降低了FLOPs、内存使用和延迟。

Conclusion: EgoPrune在边缘设备上展示了实际部署的可行性，适用于实时第一人称视频推理。

Abstract: Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes
continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual
input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient
is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in
vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,
but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video
inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person
videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints
inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a
training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.
EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR
for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering
(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and
removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token
selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame
diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune
consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning
ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,
we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB
edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for
on-device egomotion video reasoning.

TL;DR: RAda是一种简单有效的视觉语言模型（VLM）微调方法，通过动态校准融合表示中的元素贡献，提升跨模态交互效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽视融合表示在决策中的关键作用，RAda旨在填补这一空白。

Method: RAda使用轻量级注意力层生成学习掩码，动态调整融合表示中各元素的贡献。

Result: 在不同设置下，RAda均显著提升基线性能，且与现有方法表现相当。

Conclusion: RAda是一种通用且高效的微调技术，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective
fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation
from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of
their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational
matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple
yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly
exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a
learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end
of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the
rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal
interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.
Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained
encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the
unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning
technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably
against current arts in most settings. Code is available at

Motivation: 在德国农村一起家庭谋杀案中，传统搜索方法因植被密集而失效，亟需一种有效的异常检测方法支持搜捕和救援行动。

Method: 利用研究飞机拍摄高分辨率航拍图像，通过众包标注生成包含遮挡和真实场景的异常数据集，并开发了交互式网络界面支持动态标注。

Result: 现有异常检测方法在复杂森林环境中表现不佳，凸显了需要上下文感知方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 该数据集为改进复杂环境下的异常检测提供了基准，支持未来搜捕和救援技术的开发。

Abstract: After a family murder in rural Germany, authorities failed to locate the
suspect in a vast forest despite a massive search. To aid the search, a
research aircraft captured high-resolution aerial imagery. Due to dense
vegetation obscuring small clues, automated analysis was ineffective, prompting
a crowd-search initiative. This effort produced a unique dataset of labeled,
hard-to-detect anomalies under occluded, real-world conditions. It can serve as
a benchmark for improving anomaly detection approaches in complex forest
environments, supporting manhunts and rescue operations. Initial benchmark
tests showed existing methods performed poorly, highlighting the need for
context-aware approaches. The dataset is openly accessible for offline
processing. An additional interactive web interface supports online viewing and
dynamic growth by allowing users to annotate and submit new findings.

Abstract: Odometry is a critical task for autonomous systems for self-localization and
navigation. We propose a novel LiDAR-Visual odometry framework that integrates
LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our
method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images
through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction
network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware
representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine
flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our
hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively,
ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities.
Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our
approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art visual and LiDAR odometry methods.

TL;DR: UMIVR是一个基于不确定性最小化的交互式文本到视频检索框架，通过量化文本模糊性、映射不确定性和帧不确定性，生成针对性问题以优化检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频检索存在文本模糊性、映射不确定性和低质量视频帧等问题，现有方法缺乏对这些不确定性的量化，限制了检索效果。

Method: UMIVR使用语义熵（TAS）、Jensen-Shannon散度（MUS）和时间质量采样器（TQFS）量化不确定性，并生成针对性问题迭代优化查询。

Result: 在MSR-VTT-1k数据集上，UMIVR在10轮交互后Recall@1达到69.2%，显著提升检索效果。

Conclusion: UMIVR通过量化不确定性并生成针对性问题，为交互式文本到视频检索提供了有效的不确定性最小化基础。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by
multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct
text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems
have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through
clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc
strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their
effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an
Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that
explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping
uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:
semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based
Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions
guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,
significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1
(69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby
establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.

TL;DR: SAIGFormer是一种基于Transformer的低光增强方法，通过动态积分图像表示和光照引导的自注意力机制，显著提升了非均匀光照场景下的恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在非均匀光照场景（如背光和阴影）中表现不佳，导致过曝或亮度恢复不足。

Method: 提出动态积分图像表示建模空间变化光照，构建SAI²E估计器，并引入光照引导的多头自注意力机制（IG-MSA）。

Result: 在五个标准低光数据集和跨域基准（LOL-Blur）上，SAIGFormer在定量和定性指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAIGFormer在非均匀光照增强中表现卓越，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Transformer-based low-light enhancement methods have made promising
progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with
non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as
over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge,
we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer)
framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we
propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying
illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral
Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an
Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which
leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward
visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard
low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our
SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves
superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频间帧对帧对应关系学习中，受顺序变化、背景/冗余帧和重复动作影响，性能不佳。

Method: 采用融合Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输和结构先验的框架，并引入对比正则化以避免嵌入空间退化。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中表现优于传统方法如OPEL。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了自监督程序学习中的关键挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: We study the problem of self-supervised procedure learning, which discovers
key steps and establishes their order from a set of unlabeled procedural
videos. Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame
correspondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.
However, their performance often suffers from order variations,
background/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which
utilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a
structural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,
optimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to
degenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the
embedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To
address that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization
term, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,
avoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,
ProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our
approach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional
Kantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.

Motivation: 手术场景理解需要全面捕捉工具、解剖结构及其交互，但现有图表示方法对工具-动作-目标组合和操作手身份的研究不足。

Conclusion: Endoscapes-SG201和SSG-Com为手术场景理解提供了更全面的图表示方法，未来可进一步优化和扩展。

Abstract: Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention
systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves
diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their
interactions. To effectively represent the complex information in surgical
scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model
surgical entities and their relationships. Previous surgical scene graph
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of representing surgical scenes using
graphs. However, certain aspects of surgical scenes-such as diverse
combinations of tool-action-target and the identity of the hand operating the
tool-remain underexplored in graph-based representations, despite their
importance. To incorporate these aspects into graph representations, we propose
Endoscapes-SG201 dataset, which includes annotations for tool-action-target
combinations and hand identity. We also introduce SSG-Com, a graph-based method
designed to learn and represent these critical elements. Through experiments on
downstream tasks such as critical view of safety assessment and action triplet
recognition, we demonstrated the importance of integrating these essential
scene graph components, highlighting their significant contribution to surgical
scene understanding. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 解决现有方法在零样本人-物交互检测中难以区分相同对象动作或泛化到未见类的问题。

Method: 低秩分解VLM文本特征，生成类共享基特征和可调权重，结合LLM动作正则化优化权重适应。

Result: 在HICO-DET上达到27.91的未见类mAP，创下零样本HOI检测新纪录。

Conclusion: HOLa通过特征分解和权重适应，显著提升零样本HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging
task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address
this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge
beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions
involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen
classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with
Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both
enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In
training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank
factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.
These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves
shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.
Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI
class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction
representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight
adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show
that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on
HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

Motivation: 传统方法将空间和时间信息分开处理，导致快速移动物体的空间信息难以准确表示，影响时空交互和视频理解。

Method: 引入非关键帧作为时间提示，结合4D视频旋转位置嵌入，保持时空顺序，增强模型对快速移动物体空间特征的关注。

Result: 实验表明，DynImg在多个视频理解基准上比现有方法提升约2%。

Conclusion: DynImg通过时间提示有效提升了视频理解的准确性，证明了其在时空信息整合中的优势。

Abstract: In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.
However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical
research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information
separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately
represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to
temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature
extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and
video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video
representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce
a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas
containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature
extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the
fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to
maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video
Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency
of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this
combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video
understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in
enhancing video comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mixup的像素级插值在医学等高风险应用中可能生成不真实图像，影响学习效果。

Method: 使用StyleGAN2-ADA生成器，通过Dirichlet和Beta分布混合标签向量，生成语义连贯的图像。

Result: 在COVIDx-CT-3数据集上，GeMix结合真实数据提升了所有测试骨干网络的macro-F1，降低了COVID-19检测的假阴性率。

Conclusion: GeMix可作为传统Mixup的直接替代方案，提供更强的正则化和语义保真度，且不破坏现有训练流程。

Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,
yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that
can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We
propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a
learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a
StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,
we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different
classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition
the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that
lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale
COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,
EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1
over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for
COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,
delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without
disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at
https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further
research.

Result: 实验显示在低功耗硬件上实现0.7 Mpixel/s的吞吐量，F1分数表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现卫星上端到端变化检测，满足实时需求。

Abstract: Change detection from satellite images typically incurs a delay ranging from
several hours up to days because of latency in downlinking the acquired images
and generating orthorectified image products at the ground stations; this may
preclude real- or near real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we
propose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This
requires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration
and change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we
present a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that
addresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep
neural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,
tailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight
co-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a
novel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection
model. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks
in a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard
processing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current
state-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system
in realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results
are obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining
a throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.

Conclusion: 通过大规模人类视频和物理指令调优，Being-H0显著提升了复杂操作任务的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained
on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation
tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and
tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant
sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To
address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation
manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web
data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training
paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical
space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic
tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which
achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand
trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further
develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous
sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a
large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We
empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and
instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.
Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic
manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied. More details are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tri-plane表示在对称区域共享特征导致多面伪影，限制了360度视图图像的生成能力。

Method: 采用圆柱坐标系设计CylinderPlane表示法，通过嵌套圆柱结构捕捉多尺度特征，避免特征混淆。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成数据集和真实图像上均优于现有方法，实现了高质量、无伪影的360度图像合成。

Conclusion: CylinderPlane表示法解决了Tri-plane的局限性，支持多视角一致性，适用于复杂几何和多分辨率场景。

Abstract: While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the
development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its
inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same
features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view
images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit
representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature
ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different
from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based
Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly
separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation
possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis.
We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites
multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more
adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of
cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical
locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning
and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is
agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any
neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and
unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation
achieves superior performance over previous methods.

Conclusion: 在特定手稿中，基于不确定性的主动学习效果不佳，需探索更实用的方法。

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is a cornerstone of music digitization
initiatives in cultural heritage, yet it remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and the complexity of historical manuscripts. In this paper, we
present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning
(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval
music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the
highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and
retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully
boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results
indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved
with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a
preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the
Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across
Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,
uncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in
data-scarcity scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对信息完整性和社会信任构成挑战，现有检测方法模型庞大且机制不明确，难以在资源有限环境中部署。

Method: 使用MesoNet、CNN-5和ResNet-18架构，在OpenForensic和FaceForensics++数据集上进行实验，采用LTH迭代幅度剪枝方法。

Result: MesoNet在80%稀疏度下保持56.2%准确率（基线为62.6%），仅需3,000参数；LTH剪枝方法优于一次性剪枝。

Conclusion: LTH方法可高效剪枝并保持性能，子网络具有跨数据集可迁移性，为可部署的深度伪造检测系统提供潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing
synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and
social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make
them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study
investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake
detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing
deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with
MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and
FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain
winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at
substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%
accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000
parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results
also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach
consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM
visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical
facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the
transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for
efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EVA的训练无关方法，通过动态选择中间层提取视觉事实信息，显著减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉识别和语言理解结合方面取得进展，但仍存在物体幻觉问题，即模型生成看似合理但实际错误的输出。研究发现先验知识在深层抑制视觉信息，但中间层的机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出EVA方法，通过对比原始输入和纯文本输入的中间层输出分布，动态选择视觉事实信息最显著的层，并将其整合到最终层以修正输出。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，EVA显著降低了幻觉率，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EVA是一种模型无关、无需训练的方法，能有效缓解MLLMs中的幻觉问题，且兼容多种解码策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by
combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content
that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to
struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible
but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the
image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly
suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.
However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer
stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and
the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability
distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a
simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with
the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output
distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and
pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally
incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,
EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding
strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on
widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces
hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a core task in computer vision. Multimodal
methods based on vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated
exceptional generalization capabilities in IQA tasks. To address the issues of
excessive parameter burden and insufficient ability to identify local distorted
features in CLIP for IQA, this study proposes a visual-language model knowledge
distillation method aimed at guiding the training of models with architectural
advantages using CLIP's IQA knowledge. First, quality-graded prompt templates
were designed to guide CLIP to output quality scores. Then, CLIP is fine-tuned
to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP
teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple
IQA datasets, and the results show that the proposed method significantly
reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods,
demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法为实际遥感应用提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera
pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.
Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose
regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that
register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from
computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are
particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,
high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To
overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel
scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We
introduce $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework
that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting
the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian
primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate
partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic
memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse
stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy
and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,
and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine
dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.
Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real
flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive
localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while
effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI点云压缩方法依赖特定训练数据分布，限制了实际应用；而INR方法虽解决了分布问题，但仅支持有损压缩且编码时间和解码器尺寸受限。

Method: 设计了点云级编码框架和高效网络初始化策略以减少60%编码时间；提出基于多尺度SparseConv的轻量级编码网络，包含尺度上下文提取、子节点预测和模型压缩模块。

Result: 在MVUB数据集上，相比G-PCC TMC13v23和SparsePCGC，分别减少21.21%和21.95%的比特流。

Conclusion: LINR-PCGC首次实现了基于INR的无损点云几何压缩，显著提升了压缩效率和编码速度。

Abstract: Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on
specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by
encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more
distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time
and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry
compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud
geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for
Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we
design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network
initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A
lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale
context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is
proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental
results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based
methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method
reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and
21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅在重建高质量新视图时容易过拟合高频细节，现有傅里叶变换方法参数调优困难且偏向有害高频学习。

Method: 利用小波空间损失提供额外空间监督，仅监督低频LL子带，同时自监督高频HH子带的稀疏性。

Result: 实验表明DWTGS优于基于傅里叶的方法，低频策略提高了泛化能力并减少了高频幻觉。

Conclusion: 小波变换的频率正则化方法在稀疏视图3D重建中表现更优。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related
applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved
significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a
key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world
systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA
method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,
our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and
distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher
model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first
train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate
pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are
used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to
combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model
through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further
pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.
The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,
pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled
images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an
extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place
in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at

Result: 控制标记预填充表现优异，采样时间增强技术显著提升控制生成一致性。

Conclusion: 适配器方法在有限数据下保持生成质量，但全训练在一致性上表现更优。

Abstract: Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important
area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their
own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task
has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing
stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific
comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation
paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to
performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches
become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways
across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop
transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the
literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on
ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.
First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and
performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously
underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending
classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a
strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the
motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate
"forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream
data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control
consistency. Code will be released upon publication.

Result: 显著提升了长视频的时序和内容一致性，且计算开销可控。

Conclusion: TokensGen为长视频生成提供了可扩展的模块化解决方案，适用于叙事、电影制作等领域。

Abstract: Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while
diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,
extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and
long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage
framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method
decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic
control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth
transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion
model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses
short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To
(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens
at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,
an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,
reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal
and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By
leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method
provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new
possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive
simulations. Please see our project page at

Method: 采用Transformer预测空间自适应双边网格，校正光度变化，保持多视角一致性，无需场景特定重训练，并将其集成到3D高斯泼溅管线中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重建保真度和收敛速度上优于或匹配现有场景特定优化方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多视角光度校正和重建质量上表现优异，同时保持高效训练。

Abstract: Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as
exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while
beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across
views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade
the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene
representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to
address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and
slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that
predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations
in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization
without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned
grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction
quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show
that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization
methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.

mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割方法对所有错误同等惩罚，未能利用标签空间的语义层次关系，尤其在标签类别复杂时表现不佳。

Method: 提出两种树状语义损失函数，结合稀疏标注训练方法，应用于全监督和稀疏标注的医学图像分割任务。

Result: 在头部MRI全脑分区和神经外科高光谱图像分割任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 树状语义损失函数能有效利用标签层次结构，提升医学图像分割的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: Rich and accurate medical image segmentation is poised to underpin the next
generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for
pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and
supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning
methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors
equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels
space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of
labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose
two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical
organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently
proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to
extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are
reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI
for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art
performance in both cases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LoRA方法中固定秩选择对医学图像任务复杂性的挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且鲁棒，能自动适应任务需求，提升医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is
increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness
and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently
occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its
implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be
challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each
medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image
processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that
dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank
representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value
decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,
and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a
penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find
task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic
few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA
and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base
organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant
performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and
robustness against suboptimal rank initialization. Our code is publicly

Abstract: The paper investigates the performance of state-of-the-art low-parameter deep
neural networks for computer vision, focusing on bottleneck architectures and
their behavior using superlinear activation functions. We address interference
in feature maps, a phenomenon associated with superposition, where neurons
simultaneously encode multiple characteristics. Our research suggests that
limiting interference can enhance scaling and accuracy in very low-scaled
networks (under 1.5M parameters). We identify key design elements that reduce
interference by examining various bottleneck architectures, leading to a more
efficient neural network. Consequently, we propose a proof-of-concept
architecture named NoDepth Bottleneck built on mechanistic insights from our
experiments, demonstrating robust scaling accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.
These findings contribute to more efficient and scalable neural networks for
the low-parameter range and advance the understanding of bottlenecks in

Conclusion: ConformalSAM有效利用基础分割模型，解决了标签稀缺问题，提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive
and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised
semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the
labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through
self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation
models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize
across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational
segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as
an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of
using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual
input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the
shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose
ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation
model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable
pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as
supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models
to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the
strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which
benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training
strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training
stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,
ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and
helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在MICL中未能有效利用视觉信息，导致性能受限。本文旨在解决这一问题，提升模型的多模态适应能力。

Method: 提出动态注意力重分配（DARA）策略，调整视觉和文本令牌的注意力权重；并构建TrueMICL数据集，明确要求整合多模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，提出的方法显著提升了模型的多模态上下文学习能力。

Conclusion: DARA和TrueMICL为提升MLLMs的多模态适应能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language
backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new
tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and
answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language
datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the
demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on
textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal
adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its
practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the
improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual
context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably
evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,
we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient
fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by
rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present
TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that
explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly
visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements
in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are

Conclusion: 扩散模型在多变量建模和反演中具有高效性和灵活性，适用于直接和间接条件数据。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for
deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of
multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first
demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities
compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In
diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large
number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for
conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion
Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce
a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is
inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate
geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance.
Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and
nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly
improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability
density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original
approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data,
individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the
diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop
around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Motivation: 现有T2V模型在物理常识方面表现不足，生成的视频常违反因果关系、物体行为和工具使用等直觉期望。

Method: 设计PhysVidBench基准，包含383个提示，通过三阶段评估（问题生成、视频字幕、语言模型回答）间接测试物理合理性。

Result: PhysVidBench提供了一个结构化、可解释的框架，用于评估生成视频模型的物理常识能力，尤其关注工具使用和材料属性。

Conclusion: PhysVidBench填补了T2V评估中物理常识的空白，为未来模型改进提供了明确方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis
of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.
However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing
outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,
and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The
benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,
material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical
plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse
state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)
formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated
video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer
several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect
strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based
evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas
overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,
interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video
models.

Motivation: 当前视频对象分割方法依赖外观匹配，缺乏人类对对象的概念理解，导致在复杂场景中表现不佳。

Method: SeC利用大型视觉语言模型构建对象中心的高层次表示，动态平衡语义推理和特征匹配。

Result: SeC在SeCVOS基准上比SAM 2.1提升11.8分，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: SeC通过概念驱动的方法显著提升了视频对象分割的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring
models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable
advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human
capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex
scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance
matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that
enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,
we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that
shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and
utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,
constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a
comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,
realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively
balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,
dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To
rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual
reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex
Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160
manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with
substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In
particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.

Motivation: 现代生成模型的训练目标（如从高斯噪声或掩码中重建干净信号）与分词器的设计目标存在潜在联系，作者希望通过对齐这两者来提升分词器的有效性。

Method: 提出l-DeTok，通过训练分词器从受插值噪声和随机掩码污染的潜在嵌入中重建干净图像。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，l-DeTok在六种代表性生成模型中均优于标准分词器。

Conclusion: 去噪应作为分词器设计的基本原则，为未来分词器设计提供新视角。

Abstract: Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make
visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that
modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --
reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or
masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose
aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,
encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily
corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer
(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images
from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer
consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative
generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design
principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new
perspectives for future tokenizer design.

Motivation: LLMs在专业领域（如金融、医学、法律）写作时缺乏深度知识且易产生幻觉，现有方法（如RAG或在线搜索）存在不一致性或质量下降问题。

Method: DeepWriter采用任务分解、大纲生成、多模态检索和分步写作的流程，结合结构化知识库和视觉元素，生成专业文档。

Result: 实验表明，DeepWriter在金融报告生成中表现优于现有基线，内容质量和事实准确性更高。

Conclusion: DeepWriter通过离线知识库和多模态方法，显著提升了专业领域写作的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various applications. However, their use as writing assistants in specialized
domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep
domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,
such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency
across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often
degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we
introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant
that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a
novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal
retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining
information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual
elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and
professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge
representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on
financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality,
verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and
generated content quality.

Result: 编辑的知识在微调中更容易遗忘，冻结相关层可显著提升知识保留。

Conclusion: 当前编辑方法在微调下的稳健性不足，未来需改进编辑方法以增强知识保留。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often
requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired
information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as
efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge
modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training.
In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream
tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge
remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how
different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing
techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more
susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired
through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current
editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under
downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further
find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly
improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods
might be made more robust.

Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source
collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple
open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this,
we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework
with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and
generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior
Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select
the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose
an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the
generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the
high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight
mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating
fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,
e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)
across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results
of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source
LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence. Code will be released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人很少阅读隐私政策，但需要了解其内容以保护个人数据。PoliAnalyzer旨在自动化分析隐私政策，帮助用户掌握数据使用情况。

Method: 结合NLP提取政策文本的正式表示，通过逻辑推理比较用户偏好与政策内容，生成合规报告。扩展了现有的数据使用政策语言。

Result: 在评估中，PoliAnalyzer的F1分数达90-100%，能高效识别数据使用实践。分析显示95.2%的政策内容与用户偏好无冲突。

Conclusion: PoliAnalyzer能规模化支持个性化隐私政策分析，帮助用户控制数据，促进社会对平台数据实践的讨论。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites despite claiming
otherwise. This paper introduces PoliAnalyzer, a neuro-symbolic system that
assists users with personalized privacy policy analysis. PoliAnalyzer uses
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract formal representations of data
usage practices from policy texts. In favor of deterministic, logical inference
is applied to compare user preferences with the formal privacy policy
representation and produce a compliance report. To achieve this, we extend an
existing formal Data Terms of Use policy language to model privacy policies as
app policies and user preferences as data policies. In our evaluation using our
enriched PolicyIE dataset curated by legal experts, PoliAnalyzer demonstrated
high accuracy in identifying relevant data usage practices, achieving F1-score
of 90-100% across most tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how PoliAnalyzer can
model diverse user data-sharing preferences, derived from prior research as 23
user profiles, and perform compliance analysis against the top 100 most-visited
websites. This analysis revealed that, on average, 95.2% of a privacy policy's
segments do not conflict with the analyzed user preferences, enabling users to
concentrate on understanding the 4.8% (636 / 13205) that violates preferences,
significantly reducing cognitive burden. Further, we identified common
practices in privacy policies that violate user expectations - such as the
sharing of location data with 3rd parties. This paper demonstrates that
PoliAnalyzer can support automated personalized privacy policy analysis at
scale using off-the-shelf NLP tools. This sheds light on a pathway to help
individuals regain control over their data and encourage societal discussions
on platform data practices to promote a fairer power dynamic.

Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness frequently underdiagnosed due to
subtle early symptoms and social stigma. This paper explores the advanced
natural language processing (NLP) models for recognizing signs of bipolar
disorder based on user-generated social media text. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA,
DistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized
(BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed
on a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity
through sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate
that RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an
F1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical
results. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture
meaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the
critical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In
addition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers
an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. In general, our study

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在用户交互应用中会根据用户的身份标记（如种族、性别、年龄）产生偏见，导致医疗、法律、政治等领域的不公平结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs如何利用用户文本中的身份信息进行决策，并分析其在高风险应用中的潜在偏见。

Method: 对五个高风险领域的LLM应用（医疗、法律、政治、政府福利、薪资）进行全面分析，评估身份标记对模型响应的影响。

Result: LLMs对身份标记极为敏感，导致不同种族、性别、年龄的用户在相同情境下获得不同的响应，例如医疗建议、薪资推荐和政治观点。

Conclusion: 使用现成的LLMs可能加剧社会不平等，建议在部署前进行更严格的评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in user-facing
applications, from providing medical consultations to job interview advice.
Recent research suggests that these models are becoming increasingly proficient
at inferring identity information about the author of a piece of text from
linguistic patterns as subtle as the choice of a few words. However, little is
known about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in
real-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how
identity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five
different high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,
politics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are
extremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,
gender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For
instance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different
standards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same
symptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a
conservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by
older (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for
non-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken
together, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these
applications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps,
and create different political factual realities for people of different
identities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for
evaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts
model decisions. Given the serious implications of these findings, we recommend
that similar thorough assessments of LLM use in user-facing applications are
conducted before future deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出CCL-XCoT框架，通过两阶段微调减少多语言大模型在低资源语言中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言中易产生幻觉（如错误或虚构输出），影响领域特定生成任务。

Method: 1. 基于课程的对比学习增强跨语言语义对齐；2. 跨语言思维链（XCoT）提示策略引导模型推理。

Result: CCL-XCoT将幻觉率降低62%，显著提升跨语言事实知识迁移。

Conclusion: CCL-XCoT有效减少幻觉，无需外部检索或多模型集成。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate strong generalization
across languages, yet they remain prone to hallucinations, especially in
low-resource languages, due to training data imbalances. These hallucinations,
which include inaccurate or fabricated outputs, are particularly problematic in
domain-specific generation tasks (Chataigner et al., 2024). To address this
challenge, we propose CCL-XCoT(Curriculum-based Contrastive Learning-based
Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought), a two-stage fine-tuning framework for
mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. Our approach first enhances cross-lingual
semantic alignment through curriculum-based contrastive learning combined with
next-token prediction during continued pre-training. Building on this
foundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting
strategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a
high-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource
language. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates
by up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across
language pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.

Motivation: 由于LLM的开发、训练和部署需要大量资源，且模型和数据集可能继承漏洞或偏见，因此理解其供应链关系对风险检测、公平性和合规性至关重要。

Method: 设计了一种系统收集LLM供应链数据的方法，并构建了有向异构图来建模模型与数据集的关系。

Result: 发现供应链图具有大规模、稀疏性、幂律分布、核心密集外围碎片化、数据集关键作用、模型与数据集强依赖以及动态更新等特点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning to process and predict
sequences of words from context, enabling them to perform various NLP tasks,
such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation.
However, the growing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying
advanced LLMs require extensive computational resources and large datasets.
This creates a barrier for users. As a result, platforms that host models and
datasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular
platforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no
sign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained
models, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or
malicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical
to understand the origin and development of these components to better detect
potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by
this, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,
which are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to
systematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a
directed heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and
datasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We
then perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the
LLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree
distribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented
periphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong
interdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is
dynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.

Evaluated across 5 task categories, Promptomatix achieves competitive or
superior performance compared to existing libraries, while reducing prompt
length and computational overhead making prompt optimization scalable and

Conclusion: ChartScope为图表理解提供了高效解决方案，并建立了新的评估基准。

Abstract: Recent methods for customizing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for
domain-specific tasks have shown promising results in scientific chart
comprehension. However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First,
they rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization
to wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for
chart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying
data. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth
chart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data
generation pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart
types, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model
to succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning
capabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we
establish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering
at different levels but also underlying data understanding. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChartScope significantly enhances comprehension on a
wide range of chart types. The code and data are available at

Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言中表现较差，而高质量对齐数据稀缺且翻译成本高，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出选择性翻译技术，仅翻译可翻译部分，保留代码、数学表达式等非翻译内容，并比较了GCP和Llama-3.1-405B的翻译效果。

Result: 实验表明选择性翻译优于传统翻译方法，尤其在保留非翻译内容和句子结构方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 选择性翻译是提升多语言大模型对齐效果的实用且有效的方法。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap
between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource
settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet
challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets
are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive
and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English
alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve
critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured
formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective
translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable
parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence
structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this
approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the
importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated
samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on
the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by
Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the
promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for
improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Motivation: 探究LLMs是否以类似人类的方式处理语言中的时间意义（如叙事中的时态），以评估其认知能力。

Method: 采用专家参与的探测流程，通过一系列实验评估LLMs对语义和语用推理的处理。

Result: LLMs过度依赖典型性，产生不一致的时态判断，且在因果推理方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在叙事理解上与人类存在根本差异，需开发标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit increasingly sophisticated linguistic
capabilities, yet the extent to which these behaviors reflect human-like
cognition versus advanced pattern recognition remains an open question. In this
study, we investigate how LLMs process the temporal meaning of linguistic
aspect in narratives that were previously used in human studies. Using an
Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted
experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and
pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner. Our findings show that LLMs
over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and
struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about
their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs
process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative
understanding. Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized
experimental framework for the reliable assessment of LLMs' cognitive and
linguistic capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻依赖广告收入，导致标题常为点击诱饵，影响信息质量和读者信任。研究旨在提升检测方法，尤其在资源较少的语言中。

Method: 构建了克罗地亚新闻标题数据集CLIC，微调BERTi'c模型，并与基于LLM的上下文学习方法（克罗地亚语和英语提示）对比。

Result: 近半数标题含点击诱饵，微调模型表现优于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 微调模型在点击诱饵检测任务中效果更佳，尤其在资源较少的语言中。

Abstract: Online news outlets operate predominantly on an advertising-based revenue
model, compelling journalists to create headlines that are often scandalous,
intriguing, and provocative -- commonly referred to as clickbait. Automatic
detection of clickbait headlines is essential for preserving information
quality and reader trust in digital media and requires both contextual
understanding and world knowledge. For this task, particularly in
less-resourced languages, it remains unclear whether fine-tuned methods or
in-context learning (ICL) yield better results. In this paper, we compile CLIC,
a novel dataset for clickbait detection of Croatian news headlines spanning a
20-year period and encompassing mainstream and fringe outlets. We fine-tune the
BERTi\'c model on this task and compare its performance to LLM-based ICL
methods with prompts both in Croatian and English. Finally, we analyze the
linguistic properties of clickbait. We find that nearly half of the analyzed
headlines contain clickbait, and that finetuned models deliver better results
than general LLMs.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在人格评估中的潜力，解决以往研究中依赖合成数据或缺乏心理测量效度的问题。

Method: 使用555份半结构化访谈和BFI-10自评分数作为基准，测试了三种先进LLM（GPT-4.1 Mini、Meta-LLaMA和DeepSeek）在零样本提示和思维链提示下的表现。

Result: 模型表现出高重测信度，但构念效度低（最大Pearson's r = 0.27），预测偏向中等或高特质水平。思维链提示和更长输入上下文略微改善了分布对齐，但未提升特质准确性。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在人格推断中存在局限性，需基于证据的开发以支持心理学应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's LLaMA offer a
promising approach for scalable personality assessment from open-ended
language. However, inferring personality traits remains challenging, and
earlier work often relied on synthetic data or social media text lacking
psychometric validity. We introduce a real-world benchmark of 555
semi-structured interviews with BFI-10 self-report scores for evaluating
LLM-based personality inference. Three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1 Mini,
Meta-LLaMA, and DeepSeek) were tested using zero-shot prompting for BFI-10 item
prediction and both zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting for Big Five trait
inference. All models showed high test-retest reliability, but construct
validity was limited: correlations with ground-truth scores were weak (max
Pearson's $r = 0.27$), interrater agreement was low (Cohen's $\kappa < 0.10$),
and predictions were biased toward moderate or high trait levels.
Chain-of-thought prompting and longer input context modestly improved
distributional alignment, but not trait-level accuracy. These results
underscore limitations in current LLM-based personality inference and highlight
the need for evidence-based development for psychological applications.

self-serve data insights from a large, dynamic data lake. Our approach features
three components. First, we construct a knowledge graph that captures
up-to-date semantics by indexing database metadata, historical query logs,
wikis, and code. We apply clustering to identify relevant tables for each team

context from the knowledge graph, writes a query, and automatically corrects
hallucinations and syntax errors. Third, we build an interactive chatbot that
supports various user intents, from data discovery to query writing to
debugging, and displays responses in rich UI elements to encourage follow-up
chats. Our chatbot has over 300 weekly users. Expert review shows that 53% of
its responses are correct or close to correct on an internal benchmark set.
Through ablation studies, we identify the most important knowledge graph and

Abstract: Relation Classification (RC) in biomedical texts is essential for
constructing knowledge graphs and enabling applications such as drug
repurposing and clinical decision-making. We propose an error-aware
teacher--student framework that improves RC through structured guidance from a
large language model (GPT-4o). Prediction failures from a baseline student
model are analyzed by the teacher to classify error types, assign difficulty
scores, and generate targeted remediations, including sentence rewrites and
suggestions for KG-based enrichment. These enriched annotations are used to
train a first student model via instruction tuning. This model then annotates a
broader dataset with difficulty scores and remediation-enhanced inputs. A
second student is subsequently trained via curriculum learning on this dataset,
ordered by difficulty, to promote robust and progressive learning. We also
construct a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph from PubMed abstracts to
support context-aware RC. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on 4 of 5 PPI datasets and the DDI dataset, while remaining
competitive on ChemProt.

Abstract: Detecting collaborative problem solving (CPS) indicators from dialogue using
machine learning techniques is a significant challenge for the field of AI in
Education. Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to
reliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the
multimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and
acoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial
results demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of
these enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on
leveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop
paper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not
only improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,
but it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT
model for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar
significant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for
classifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted
that larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall
performance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision
of the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement
among human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within
these subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance
across all indicators was inconsistent. We conclude the paper by outlining a
structured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS
diagnosis, highlighting the crucial inclusion of model explainability to
support human agency and engagement in the reflective coding process.

Motivation: 增强BERT模型在CPS诊断中的可解释性，以提升教师等终端用户的信任和采用率。

Method: 使用SHAP分析BERT模型中词标记对CPS分类的贡献。

Result: 发现分类性能高不一定解释合理，某些词标记频繁影响分类，甚至存在无意义的虚假词。

Conclusion: 模型对词标记的合理使用与类别数量相关，需研究集成模型架构和人机互补以提升CPS诊断。

Abstract: The use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
model and its variants for classifying collaborative problem solving (CPS) has
been extensively explored within the AI in Education community. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised
words in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions.
Enhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to
better inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and
facilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary
step towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription
data contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The
findings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily
equate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular
tokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis
also identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the
classification but was not semantically meaningful to the class. While such
model transparency is unlikely to be useful to an end user to improve their
practice, it can help them not to overrely on LLM diagnostics and ignore their
human expertise. We conclude the workshop paper by noting that the extent to
which the model appropriately uses the tokens for its classification is
associated with the number of classes involved. It calls for an investigation
into the exploration of ensemble model architectures and the involvement of
human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, since considerable human reasoning
is still required for fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills.

Motivation: 解决领域特定机器学习任务中数据稀缺和类别不平衡的问题，探索传统方法在新一代模型中的表现。

Method: 选择了利用ChatGPT的方法和传统数据增强方法（如复述和回译），并在多个实验设置中比较了四种不同的数据增强方法。

Result: 回译和复述方法在生成数据质量和分类性能上表现优于零样本和少样本生成方法。

Conclusion: 传统数据增强方法结合新一代模型可以取得与纯生成方法相当甚至更好的效果。

Abstract: Numerous domain-specific machine learning tasks struggle with data scarcity
and class imbalance. This paper systematically explores data augmentation
methods for NLP, particularly through large language models like GPT. The
purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate whether traditional methods
such as paraphrasing and backtranslation can leverage a new generation of
models to achieve comparable performance to purely generative methods. Methods
aimed at solving the problem of data scarcity and utilizing ChatGPT were
chosen, as well as an exemplary dataset. We conducted a series of experiments
comparing four different approaches to data augmentation in multiple
experimental setups. We then evaluated the results both in terms of the quality
of generated data and its impact on classification performance. The key
findings indicate that backtranslation and paraphrasing can yield comparable or
even better results than zero and a few-shot generation of examples.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在非洲基层医疗中的有效性，尤其是在资源匮乏的环境中，以改善医疗服务的可及性。

Method: 使用RAG技术将临床问题与肯尼亚国家指南对齐，生成多语言临床场景、选择题和答案，并通过专家评审确保质量。

Result: 创建了Alama Health QA数据集，揭示了LLMs在本地化医疗内容上的性能不足。

Conclusion: 该研究为非洲医疗系统中的AI安全部署提供了一个可复制的动态基准测试模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) hold promise for improving healthcare access in
low-resource settings, but their effectiveness in African primary care remains
underexplored. We present a methodology for creating a benchmark dataset and
evaluation framework focused on Kenyan Level 2 and 3 clinical care. Our
approach uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ground clinical questions
in Kenya's national guidelines, ensuring alignment with local standards. These
guidelines were digitized, chunked, and indexed for semantic retrieval. Gemini
Flash 2.0 Lite was then prompted with guideline excerpts to generate realistic
clinical scenarios, multiple-choice questions, and rationale based answers in
English and Swahili. Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, and
a blinded expert review process ensured clinical accuracy, clarity, and
cultural appropriateness. The resulting Alama Health QA dataset includes
thousands of regulator-aligned question answer pairs across common outpatient
conditions. Beyond accuracy, we introduce evaluation metrics that test clinical
reasoning, safety, and adaptability such as rare case detection (Needle in the
Haystack), stepwise logic (Decision Points), and contextual adaptability.
Initial results reveal significant performance gaps when LLMs are applied to
localized scenarios, consistent with findings that LLM accuracy is lower on
African medical content than on US-based benchmarks. This work offers a
replicable model for guideline-driven, dynamic benchmarking to support safe AI
deployment in African health systems.

Method: 使用Bigger Analogy Test Set，通过线性变换Ws（s为主词标记的中间层表示，W为模型导数）重现客体状态。

Result: 在形态学关系上达到90%的忠实度，多语言和多模型验证了类似结果。

Conclusion: 语言模型中的某些概念关系（如形态学）可通过跨层线性变换稀疏编码，且在潜在空间中易于解释。

Abstract: A two-part affine approximation has been found to be a good approximation for
transformer computations over certain subject object relations. Adapting the
Bigger Analogy Test Set, we show that the linear transformation Ws, where s is
a middle layer representation of a subject token and W is derived from model
derivatives, is also able to accurately reproduce final object states for many
relations. This linear technique is able to achieve 90% faithfulness on
morphological relations, and we show similar findings multi-lingually and
across models. Our findings indicate that some conceptual relationships in
language models, such as morphology, are readily interpretable from latent
space, and are sparsely encoded by cross-layer linear transformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成内容时可能出现幻觉（不准确回答），这对其安全性和可靠性构成威胁。不确定性估计是解决这一问题的关键。

Method: Cleanse方法通过聚类量化隐藏嵌入中的语义一致性比例，以估计不确定性。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B、LLaMA-13B、LLaMA2-7B和Mistral-7B模型及SQuAD和CoQA基准测试中验证了Cleanse的有效性。

Conclusion: Cleanse为检测LLM幻觉提供了一种有效的不确定性估计方法，有助于提升模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) across
various NLP tasks, hallucinations in LLMs--where LLMs generate inaccurate
responses--remains as a critical problem as it can be directly connected to a
crisis of building safe and reliable LLMs. Uncertainty estimation is primarily
used to measure hallucination levels in LLM responses so that correct and
incorrect answers can be distinguished clearly. This study proposes an
effective uncertainty estimation approach, \textbf{Cl}ust\textbf{e}ring-based
sem\textbf{an}tic con\textbf{s}ist\textbf{e}ncy (\textbf{Cleanse}). Cleanse
quantifies the uncertainty with the proportion of the intra-cluster consistency
in the total consistency between LLM hidden embeddings which contain adequate
semantic information of generations, by employing clustering. The effectiveness
of Cleanse for detecting hallucination is validated using four off-the-shelf
models, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B and two
question-answering benchmarks, SQuAD and CoQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语料库处理泰语时缺乏透明度和文化适应性，导致低质量和风险内容未被处理。

Method: 采用泰语适配的Dolma流程，包括自定义语言识别、质量过滤器和内容过滤器，结合非网络来源数据。

Result: 语料库显著提升模型性能，SEA-LION模型在泰语基准测试中超越其他模型。

Conclusion: Mangosteen为泰语及区域LLM研究提供了可复现的高质量基础。

Abstract: Pre-training data shapes a language model's quality, but raw web text is
noisy and demands careful cleaning. Existing large-scale corpora rely on
English-centric or language-agnostic pipelines whose heuristics do not capture
Thai script or cultural nuances, leaving risky material such as gambling
content untreated. Prior Thai-specific efforts customize pipelines or build new
ones, yet seldom release their data or document design choices, hindering
reproducibility and raising the question of how to construct a transparent,
high-quality Thai corpus. We introduce Mangosteen: a 47 billion-token Thai
corpus built through a Thai-adapted Dolma pipeline that includes custom
rule-based language ID, revised C4/Gopher quality filters, and Thai-trained
content filters, plus curated non-web sources such as Wikipedia, Royal Gazette
texts, OCR-extracted books, and CC-licensed YouTube subtitles. Systematic
ablations using GPT-2 show the pipeline trims CommonCrawl from 202M to 25M
documents while raising SEA-HELM NLG from 3 to 11; an 8B-parameter SEA-LION
model continually pre-trained on Mangosteen then surpasses SEA-LION-v3 and
Llama-3.1 by about four points on Thai benchmarks. We release the full pipeline
code, cleaning manifests, corpus snapshot, and all checkpoints, providing a
fully reproducible foundation for future Thai and regional LLM research.

Motivation: 医疗编码对医疗数据管理至关重要，研究旨在探索LLMs在自动化编码中的潜力。

Method: 使用437个巴西葡萄牙语临床表达数据集，通过语义搜索和33个LLMs选择最佳ICPC-2代码，评估性能指标。

Result: 28个模型F1分数>0.8，10个>0.85；检索优化可提升性能；小模型表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动化ICPC-2编码中潜力巨大，但需更广泛的多语言和端到端评估。

Abstract: Background: Medical coding structures healthcare data for research, quality
monitoring, and policy. This study assesses the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to assign ICPC-2 codes using the output of a domain-specific
search engine.
  Methods: A dataset of 437 Brazilian Portuguese clinical expressions, each
annotated with ICPC-2 codes, was used. A semantic search engine (OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) retrieved candidates from 73,563 labeled concepts.
Thirty-three LLMs were prompted with each query and retrieved results to select
the best-matching ICPC-2 code. Performance was evaluated using F1-score, along
with token usage, cost, response time, and format adherence.
  Results: Twenty-eight models achieved F1-score > 0.8; ten exceeded 0.85. Top
performers included gpt-4.5-preview, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro. Retriever
optimization can improve performance by up to 4 points. Most models returned
valid codes in the expected format, with reduced hallucinations. Smaller models
(<3B) struggled with formatting and input length.
  Conclusions: LLMs show strong potential for automating ICPC-2 coding, even
without fine-tuning. This work offers a benchmark and highlights challenges,
but findings are limited by dataset scope and setup. Broader, multilingual,
end-to-end evaluations are needed for clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 封闭源模型如GPT-3虽然表现优异，但缺乏透明度和可复现性。开源项目也常因缺少关键资源而受限。

Method: 模型分两阶段训练：SFT阶段使用719K数学问题，RLVR阶段使用62K挑战性问题，并引入Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization算法。

Result: 模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，达到或超过现有开源模型的性能。

Conclusion: MiroMind-M1系列为社区提供了完整的资源，支持进一步研究和透明化发展。

Abstract: Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to
advanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language
models. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative
benchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which
can be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3
demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits
transparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to
close this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical
resources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders
reproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,
we introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on
the Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing
open-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a
carefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT
trajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To
enhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce
Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates
length-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage
context-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive
performance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B
and 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate
reproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B,
MiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K,
MiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations. We hope
these resources will support further research and foster community advancement.

Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing
their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the
quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review
of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub,
organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question
Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation,
and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3)
Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness.
Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption,
recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing
transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in
the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task
diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low
adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of
these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing

Result: 发现现有模型在零样本迁移学习中表现不佳，强调标注和评估的严谨性。

Conclusion: 呼吁在心理健康NLP中提高数据和模型可靠性，并增加语言多样性。

Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is critical for real-time suicide prevention, yet
its progress faces two under-explored challenges: limited language coverage and
unreliable annotation practices. Most available datasets are in English, but
even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a
result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining
their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other
languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via
artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by
constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media
posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three
human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the
remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability
and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal
ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained
sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation
consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our
findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches
to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP)
while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with
zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and
dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model
reliability.

Result: 研究发现评审语言中存在基于作者人口统计学的差异，匿名性对公平性的作用与传统假设不同。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了同行评审中的隐性偏见，对评审政策和科学进步提出了重要问题。

Abstract: The peer review process is often regarded as the gatekeeper of scientific
integrity, yet increasing evidence suggests that it is not immune to bias.
Although structural inequities in peer review have been widely debated, much
less attention has been paid to the subtle ways in which language itself may
reinforce disparities. This study undertakes one of the most comprehensive
linguistic analyses of peer review to date, examining more than 80,000 reviews
in two major journals. Using natural language processing and large-scale
statistical modeling, it uncovers how review tone, sentiment, and supportive
language vary across author demographics, including gender, race, and
institutional affiliation. Using a data set that includes both anonymous and
signed reviews, this research also reveals how the disclosure of reviewer
identity shapes the language of evaluation. The findings not only expose hidden
biases in peer feedback, but also challenge conventional assumptions about
anonymity's role in fairness. As academic publishing grapples with reform,
these insights raise critical questions about how review policies shape career
trajectories and scientific progress.

Conclusion: 多模态神经网络在模拟儿童语言习得中表现稳健，但个体差异提示需进一步研究数据多样性的影响。

Abstract: What insights can machine learning bring to understanding human language
acquisition? Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable
capabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a
fundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from
comparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have
increasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality
to children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024)
showed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and
linguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could
acquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success
reflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would
show consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's
experiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech
transcription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over
500 hours of video data spread across all three children. Using these automated
transcriptions, we generated multi-modal vision-and-language datasets for both
training and evaluation, and explored a range of neural network configurations
to examine the robustness of simulated word learning. Our findings demonstrate
that networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can
acquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network
architectures. These results validate the robustness of multimodal neural
networks for grounded word learning, while highlighting the individual
differences that emerge in how models learn when trained on each child's
developmental experiences.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，GRACE在HR@10和NDCG@10指标上显著优于基线模型，同时减少了48%的计算成本。

Conclusion: GRACE通过改进标记化和注意力机制，为多行为推荐提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in
multi-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of
transformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However,
their adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token
reasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity
and dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited
multi-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE
(Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on
Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior
sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit
attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over
semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation.
To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware
Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed,
intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence.
Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and
+106.7% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home
domain, and +22.1% HR@10 on the Electronics domain. GRACE also reduces
attention computation by up to 48% with long sequences.

Result: 实验表明，FastLongSpeech在长语音和短语音任务中均表现优异，显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: FastLongSpeech为LSLMs高效处理长语音提供了可行方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant
progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities
in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often
concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of
short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the
scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs
associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for
efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech
training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that
can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To
adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression
training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying
compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to
long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop
a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show
that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and
short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
transforming text descriptions or tables to data visualizations via
instruction-tuning methods. However, it is not straightforward to apply these
methods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long
documents based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the
relevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart
generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the
goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the
document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged
framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the
document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines
this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type
before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated
charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual
representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that
often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we
curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from
two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that
are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their
corresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shot
chart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our method
outperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracy
and chart type respectively over the best baselines.

Motivation: 理解扩展的长链推理蒸馏过程如何影响长上下文理解，特别是在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中。

Method: 使用从Deepseek-R1蒸馏的开源模型，通过多文档问答任务评估长上下文信息提取与整合能力。

Result: 蒸馏后的推理模式显著提升了长上下文理解能力，缓解了“中间迷失”问题。

Conclusion: 推理蒸馏通过促进更详细的推理过程，有效增强了长上下文模型的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of smaller language models. However, the impact of
large-scale reasoning distillation on other critical abilities, particularly
in-context retrieval and reasoning, remains unexplored. This gap in
understanding is particularly significant given the increasing importance of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where efficient acquisition and
utilization of contextual information are paramount for generating reliable
responses. Motivated by the need to understand how the extended long-CoT
process influences long-context comprehension, we conduct a comprehensive
investigation using a series of open-source models distilled from Deepseek-R1,
renowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities. Our study focuses on
evaluating these models' performance in extracting and integrating relevant
information from extended contexts through multi-document question and
answering tasks. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that
distilled reasoning patterns significantly improve long-context understanding.
Our analysis reveals that distillation fosters greater long-context awareness
by promoting more detailed and explicit reasoning processes during context
analysis and information parsing. This advancement effectively mitigates the
persistent "lost in the middle" issue that has hindered long-context models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）预训练需要巨大计算资源，限制了广泛研究参与，因此探索小型语言模型（TLMs）是否具备类似特性成为关键需求。

Method: 研究通过预训练BERT-6及其变体在Wikipedia子集上，并在FewRel、AGNews和DBPedia分类任务中评估性能，同时探讨了软委员会方法的有效性。

Result: 预训练的TLMs在分类任务中表现显著优于未预训练模型，且性能差距随预训练数据规模和任务重叠度增加而扩大。软委员会方法可在不影响准确性的情况下实现低延迟。

Conclusion: TLMs展现出与LLMs类似的预训练效果，为资源受限的研究提供了可行替代方案，未来研究可能进一步揭示其生物学启发的语言学习机制。

Abstract: A prominent achievement of natural language processing (NLP) is its ability
to understand and generate meaningful human language. This capability relies on
complex feedforward transformer block architectures pre-trained on large
language models (LLMs). However, LLM pre-training is currently feasible only
for a few dominant companies due to the immense computational resources
required, limiting broader research participation. This creates a critical need
for more accessible alternatives. In this study, we explore whether tiny
language models (TLMs) exhibit the same key qualitative features of LLMs. We
demonstrate that TLMs exhibit a clear performance gap between pre-trained and
non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, indicating the
effectiveness of pre-training, even at a tiny scale. The performance gap
increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and with greater overlap
between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets. Furthermore,
the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can
be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained
shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without affecting
classification accuracy. Our results are based on pre-training BERT-6 and
variants of BERT-1 on subsets of the Wikipedia dataset and evaluating their
performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. Future
research on TLM is expected to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying
NLP, especially given that its biologically inspired models suggest that TLMs
may be sufficient for children or adolescents to develop language.

TL;DR: MEKiT方法通过注入多源异构知识，显著提升大语言模型在情感-原因对提取任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要推理能力的情感-原因对提取任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏辅助知识。

Method: 提出MEKiT方法，整合内部情感知识和外部因果知识，通过指令模板和数据混合进行指令微调。

Result: 实验显示MEKiT在ECPE任务中优于基线模型，显著提升大语言模型性能。

Conclusion: MEKiT为ECPE任务提供了更有效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) excel in text comprehension and
generation, their performance on the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task,
which requires reasoning ability, is often underperform smaller language model.
The main reason is the lack of auxiliary knowledge, which limits LLMs' ability
to effectively perceive emotions and reason causes. To address this issue, we
propose a novel \textbf{M}ulti-source h\textbf{E}terogeneous \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{i}njection me\textbf{T}hod, MEKiT, which integrates heterogeneous
internal emotional knowledge and external causal knowledge. Specifically, for
these two distinct aspects and structures of knowledge, we apply the approaches
of incorporating instruction templates and mixing data for instruction-tuning,
which respectively facilitate LLMs in more comprehensively identifying emotion
and accurately reasoning causes. Experimental results demonstrate that MEKiT
provides a more effective and adaptable solution for the ECPE task, exhibiting
an absolute performance advantage over compared baselines and dramatically
improving the performance of LLMs on the ECPE task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在意外代码切换问题，影响可读性和实用性，现有方法缺乏机制分析且效果有限。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析问题，提出SASFT方法，通过监督微调控制语言特征的预激活值。

Result: 在五种模型和三种语言上，SASFT将意外代码切换减少50%以上，部分情况下完全消除，同时保持或提升多语言性能。

Conclusion: SASFT有效解决代码切换问题，同时保持模型的多语言能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive multilingual capabilities, but
they suffer from unexpected code-switching, also known as language mixing,
which involves switching to unexpected languages in the model response. This
problem leads to poor readability and degrades the usability of model
responses. However, existing work on this issue lacks a mechanistic analysis
and shows limited effectiveness. In this paper, we first provide an in-depth
analysis of unexpected code-switching using sparse autoencoders and find that
when LLMs switch to a language, the features of that language exhibit excessive
pre-activation values. Based on our findings, we propose $\textbf{S}$parse
$\textbf{A}$utoencoder-guided $\textbf{S}$upervised
$\textbf{F}$ine$\textbf{t}$uning (SASFT), which teaches LLMs to maintain
appropriate pre-activation values of specific language features during
training. Experiments on five models across three languages demonstrate that
SASFT consistently reduces unexpected code-switching by more than 50\% compared
to standard supervised fine-tuning, with complete elimination in four cases.
Moreover, SASFT maintains or even improves the models' performance on six
multilingual benchmarks, showing its effectiveness in addressing code-switching
while preserving multilingual capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言对齐评估方法主要关注句子嵌入，但神经模型的表示空间可能不平滑，影响低资源语言的语义对齐评估。

Method: 受神经科学启发，提出NeuronXA方法，通过神经元状态评估跨语言对齐能力。

Result: 在多个多语言大语言模型上测试，仅用100对平行句子，NeuronXA与下游任务性能的Pearson相关性达0.9556，与可迁移性的相关性达0.8514。

Conclusion: NeuronXA能有效评估跨语言对齐和可迁移性，即使数据量小，有望推动跨语言对齐研究和多语言大语言模型的语义理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual
capabilities, however, how to evaluate cross-lingual alignment remains
underexplored. Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence
embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a
non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation
on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar
information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron
State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a
lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded
approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several
prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two
transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that
with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability.
These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both
cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This
highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to
improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.

Conclusion: PromptSuite通过Python API和Web界面提供灵活、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating LLMs with a single prompt has proven unreliable, with small
changes leading to significant performance differences. However, generating the
prompt variations needed for a more robust multi-prompt evaluation is
challenging, limiting its adoption in practice. To address this, we introduce
PromptSuite, a framework that enables the automatic generation of various
prompts. PromptSuite is flexible - working out of the box on a wide range of
tasks and benchmarks. It follows a modular prompt design, allowing controlled
perturbations to each component, and is extensible, supporting the addition of
new components and perturbation types. Through a series of case studies, we
show that PromptSuite provides meaningful variations to support strong
evaluation practices. It is available through both a Python API:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化大型语言模型（LLM）在推理任务中的效率，避免因过度思考（overthinking）导致的资源浪费。

Method: 提出MUR方法，基于动量概念动态分配思考预算，并引入gamma-control机制调节推理预算。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MUR平均减少50%以上计算量，同时提升准确率0.62-3.37%。

Conclusion: MUR是一种无需额外训练的高效推理优化方法，显著提升LLM的推理效率与性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
reasoning-intensive tasks, yet optimizing their reasoning efficiency remains an
open challenge. While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves reasoning quality, it
often leads to overthinking, wasting tokens on redundant computations. This
work investigates how to efficiently and adaptively guide LLM test-time scaling
without additional training. Inspired by the concept of momentum in physics, we
propose Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR), which dynamically
allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking and
aggregating stepwise uncertainty over time. To support flexible inference-time
control, we introduce gamma-control, a simple mechanism that tunes the
reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter. We provide in-depth theoretical
proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of stability and biases. MUR
is comprehensively evaluated against various TTS methods across four
challenging benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA-diamond) using
different sizes of recent Qwen3 models (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). Results demonstrate
that MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by
0.62-3.37%.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法无法真正提升模型的批评能力，导致反馈肤浅且缺乏验证。

Method: 提出RefCritic，采用长链思维和双规则奖励（实例级判断正确性和策略模型改进准确性）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如AIME25提升6.8%和7.2%，且在多数投票下表现更优。

Conclusion: RefCritic在批评和改进任务中具有显著优势，优于现有方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing
effective critic modules for precise guidance has become crucial yet
challenging. In this paper, we initially demonstrate that supervised
fine-tuning for building critic modules (which is widely adopted in current
solutions) fails to genuinely enhance models' critique abilities, producing
superficial critiques with insufficient reflections and verifications. To
unlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a
long-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual
rule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and
(2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to
generate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively
guides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks. On critique and refinement
settings, RefCritic demonstrates consistent advantages across all benchmarks,
e.g., 6.8\% and 7.2\% gains on AIME25 for the respective base models. Notably,
under majority voting, policy models filtered by RefCritic show superior
scaling with increased voting numbers. Moreover, despite training on
solution-level supervision, RefCritic outperforms step-level supervised
approaches on ProcessBench, a benchmark to identify erroneous steps in
mathematical reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，WebShaper在GAIA和WebWalkerQA基准测试中达到开源IS代理的最先进性能。

Conclusion: WebShaper通过形式化驱动的方法有效解决了IS数据合成问题，提升了LLM代理的能力。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has revolutionized
artificial intelligence by enabling solutions to complex, open-ended tasks
through web-based information-seeking (IS) capabilities. The scarcity of
high-quality training data has limited the development of IS agents. Existing
approaches typically adopt an information-driven paradigm that first collects
web data and then generates questions based on the retrieval. However, this may
lead to inconsistency between information structure and reasoning structure,
question and answer. To mitigate, we propose a formalization-driven IS data
synthesis framework WebShaper to construct a dataset. WebShaper systematically
formalizes IS tasks through set theory. Central to the formalization is the
concept of Knowledge Projections (KP), which enables precise control over
reasoning structure by KP operation compositions. During synthesis, we begin by
creating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an
agentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with
retrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model
on the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper
achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced IS agents on GAIA and
WebWalkerQA benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对DNA序列建模中k-mer分割与BPE子词标记化方法的系统评估，需确定哪种方法更优。

Method: 比较k-mer分割（k=1,3,4,5,6）、BPE标记化及三种位置编码方法（sinusoidal、AliBi、RoPE），在不同层数的Transformer编码器上进行训练与评估。

Result: BPE表现更优，RoPE擅长捕捉周期性模式，AliBi在局部依赖任务中表现良好。层数增加至12层效果显著，24层可能过拟合。

Conclusion: 为DNA Transformer模型设计提供了实用的标记化和位置编码方法指导。

Abstract: Currently, many studies view DNA sequences as a special type of language and
utilize Transformers to model them. These studies use fixed-length k-mer
segmentation and BPE subword tokenization but lack a systematic evaluation to
determine which is superior. We compare k-mer segmentation with k=1,3,4,5,6, a
4,096-token BPE vocabulary, and three positional encoding methods-sinusoidal,
AliBi, and RoPE. Each configuration is trained from scratch in 3, 6, 12, and
24-layer Transformer encoders and evaluated on GUE benchmark dataset. In
general, BPE delivers higher and more stable performance across tasks by
compressing frequent motifs into variable-length tokens, reducing sequence
length, and improving model generalization. RoPE excels at capturing periodic
motifs and extrapolating to long sequences, while AliBi also performs well on
tasks driven by local dependencies. In terms of depth, we observe significant
gains when increasing layers from 3 to 12, with only marginal improvements or
slight overfitting at 24 layers. This study provides practical guidance for
designing tokenization and positional encoding in DNA Transformer models.

Method: 提出PATTR指标，考虑目标响应长度（$L_T$），生成20M词的合成语料库，并与MATTR和CR对比。

Result: PATTR能有效减少长度偏差，在筛选高多样性文本时表现优于MATTR和CR。

Conclusion: PATTR是一种鲁棒的多样性度量指标，适用于需要控制文本长度的任务。

Abstract: Synthetic text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly used
for further training and improvement of LLMs. Diversity is crucial for the
effectiveness of synthetic data, and researchers rely on prompt engineering to
improve diversity. However, the impact of prompt variations on response text
length, and, more importantly, the consequential effect on lexical diversity
measurements, remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted
Type-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We
generate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the
LLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video
script generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical
diversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average
TTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length
variations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing
metrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length
($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases. We further demonstrate the
utility of PATTR in filtering the top-10/100/1,000 most lexically diverse
responses, showing that it consistently outperforms MATTR and CR by yielding on
par or better diversity with high adherence to $L_T$.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining the semantic
entailment of a premise for a given hypothesis. The task aims to develop
systems that emulate natural human inferential processes where commonsense
knowledge plays a major role. However, existing commonsense resources lack
sufficient coverage for a variety of premise-hypothesis pairs. This study
explores the potential of Large Language Models as commonsense knowledge
generators for NLI along two key dimensions: their reliability in generating
such knowledge and the impact of that knowledge on prediction accuracy. We
adapt and modify existing metrics to assess LLM factuality and consistency in
generating in this context. While explicitly incorporating commonsense
knowledge does not consistently improve overall results, it effectively helps
distinguish entailing instances and moderately improves distinguishing
contradictory and neutral inferences.

Conclusion: 需构建标注模糊性的数据集，结合无监督检测方法，以实现更鲁棒、可解释且与人类对齐的NLI系统。

Abstract: This position paper argues that annotation disagreement in Natural Language
Inference (NLI) is not mere noise but often reflects meaningful interpretive
variation, especially when triggered by ambiguity in the premise or hypothesis.
While underspecified guidelines and annotator behavior can contribute to
variation, content-based ambiguity offers a process-independent signal of
divergent human perspectives. We call for a shift toward ambiguity-aware NLI by
systematically identifying ambiguous input pairs and classifying ambiguity
types. To support this, we present a unified framework that integrates existing
taxonomies and illustrate key ambiguity subtypes through concrete examples.
These examples reveal how ambiguity shapes annotator decisions and motivate the
need for targeted detection methods that better align models with human
interpretation. A key limitation is the lack of datasets annotated for
ambiguity and subtypes. We propose addressing this gap through new annotated
resources and unsupervised approaches to ambiguity detection -- paving the way
for more robust, explainable, and human-aligned NLI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索同音字归一化对模型性能及跨语言迁移的影响，同时避免语言特征的丢失。

Method: 采用单语训练和跨语言迁移实验，并提出后推断归一化方案。

Result: 后推断归一化使BLEU分数提升1.03，同时保留了训练中的语言特征。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁更多语言感知的干预措施，并贡献于技术驱动的语言变化讨论。

Abstract: Homophone normalization, where characters that have the same sound in a
writing script are mapped to one character, is a pre-processing step applied in
Amharic Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. While this may improve
performance reported by automatic metrics, it also results in models that are
not able to understand different forms of writing in a single language.
Further, there might be impacts in transfer learning, where models trained on
normalized data do not generalize well to other languages. In this paper, we
experiment with monolingual training and cross-lingual transfer to understand
the impacts of normalization on languages that use the Ge'ez script. We then
propose a post-inference intervention in which normalization is applied to
model predictions instead of training data. With our simple scheme of
post-inference normalization, we show that we can achieve an increase in BLEU
score of up to 1.03 while preserving language features in training. Our work
contributes to the broader discussion on technology-facilitated language change
and calls for more language-aware interventions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了三种LLM（Gemini-2.0-flash、Grok-3、GPT-4o-mini）在医学领域（高血压、糖尿病、骨科）中数据提取任务的表现，发现定制提示最有效，并提出三级自动化指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化从RCTs中提取数据用于荟萃分析仍具挑战性，需评估LLMs的实际表现。

Method: 测试了四种提示策略（基础提示、自反思提示、模型集成、定制提示），评估模型在统计结果、偏倚风险和研究特征提取中的表现。

Result: 模型精度高但召回率低，定制提示可提升召回率15%。

Conclusion: 提出三级自动化指南，平衡LLM效率与专家监督，适用于实际荟萃分析。

Abstract: Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the
practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini)
across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and
study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes,
and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic
prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts)
to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high
precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information.
We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up
to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines
for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of
automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice
for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM
efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多教师模型的知识蒸馏方法，以解决大语言模型部署中的高计算成本和推理速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的高计算成本和慢推理速度限制了其实际部署，因此需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 通过构建多个教师模型，融合其输出概率分布和中间语义特征，指导学生模型学习。采用了加权输出融合、特征对齐损失函数和熵驱动的动态教师权重策略。

Result: 学生模型在语言理解和生成能力上表现优异，同时在多任务学习中展现出高一致性和适应性。实验验证了该方法在困惑度、蒸馏损失和生成质量上的优势。

Conclusion: 多教师协作机制为大规模语言模型的高效压缩提供了可行技术路径，并在复杂语言建模任务中表现出有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high computational cost and slow
inference in deploying large language models. It proposes a distillation
strategy guided by multiple teacher models. The method constructs several
teacher models and integrates their output probability distributions and
intermediate semantic features. This guides the student model to learn from
multiple sources of knowledge. As a result, the student model gains stronger
language understanding and generation ability while maintaining a small
parameter size. To achieve this, the paper introduces a weighted output fusion
mechanism, a feature alignment loss function, and an entropy-driven dynamic
teacher weighting strategy. These components improve the quality and stability
of knowledge transfer during distillation. Under multi-teacher guidance, the
student model captures semantic information more effectively and demonstrates
strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, the
method shows high consistency in expression, generalization ability, and task
adaptability in tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and
multi-task learning. The experiments compare the proposed method with several
widely adopted distillation approaches. The results further confirm its overall
advantages in perplexity, distillation loss, and generation quality. This study
provides a feasible technical path for the efficient compression of large-scale
language models. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-teacher
collaborative mechanisms in complex language modeling tasks.

Motivation: 探讨多任务、多语言和多源学习对语言模型性能的影响，以优化模型训练和性能。

Method: 引入SOI框架分析学习行为模式，通过实验比较单任务与多任务、单源与多源、单语言与多语言学习的效果。

Result: 多源学习显著提升分布外性能（7%），多任务学习在相似任务组合中表现优异，SOI框架进一步优化性能。

Conclusion: 多源学习效果显著，SOI框架为优化多设置语言模型性能提供新方法。

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of multi-task, multi-lingual, and
multi-source learning approaches on the robustness and performance of
pretrained language models. To enhance this analysis, we introduce Subsets of
Interest (SOI), a novel categorization framework that identifies six distinct
learning behavior patterns during training, including forgettable examples,
unlearned examples, and always correct examples. Through SOI transition
heatmaps and dataset cartography visualization, we analyze how examples shift
between these categories when transitioning from single-setting to
multi-setting configurations. We perform comprehensive experiments across three
parallel comparisons: multi-task vs. single-task learning using English tasks
(entailment, paraphrase, sentiment), multi-source vs. single-source learning
using sentiment analysis datasets, and multi-lingual vs. single-lingual
learning using intent classification in French, English, and Persian. Our
results demonstrate that multi-source learning consistently improves
out-of-distribution performance by up to 7%, while multi-task learning shows
mixed results with notable gains in similar task combinations. We further
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach where the second stage leverages
SOI-based subset selection to achieve additional performance improvements.
These findings provide new insights into training dynamics and offer practical
approaches for optimizing multi-setting language model performance.

TL;DR: ChiMed 2.0是一个扩展的中文医学数据集，覆盖传统中医和现代医学数据，支持预训练、监督微调和RLHF，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中文医学数据集规模小、领域覆盖窄，无法满足预训练和RLHF需求。

Method: 提出ChiMed 2.0数据集，包含预训练、监督微调和RLHF数据，并在通用LLM上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示不同规模模型的性能提升，验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: ChiMed 2.0为中文医学LLM训练提供了高质量数据资源。

Abstract: Building high-quality data resources is crucial for advancing artificial
intelligence research and applications in specific domains, particularly in the
Chinese medical domain. Existing Chinese medical datasets are limited in size
and narrow in domain coverage, falling short of the diverse corpora required
for effective pre-training. Moreover, most datasets are designed solely for LLM
fine-tuning and do not support pre-training and reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a Chinese medical dataset
named ChiMed 2.0, which extends our previous work ChiMed, and covers data
collected from Chinese medical online platforms and generated by LLMs. ChiMed
2.0 contains 204.4M Chinese characters covering both traditional Chinese
medicine classics and modern general medical data, where there are 164.8K
documents for pre-training, 351.6K question-answering pairs for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), and 41.7K preference data tuples for RLHF. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach for training a Chinese medical LLM, we conduct
further pre-training, SFT, and RLHF experiments on representative general
domain LLMs and evaluate their performance on medical benchmark datasets. The
results show performance gains across different model scales, validating the
dataset's effectiveness and applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练策略虽能优化用户对齐，但未能提升模型的领域认知能力，因此需要一种新方法来填补这一空白。

Method: DPSE框架引入Censor模块提取多维交互信号和满意度评分，通过主题感知和偏好驱动的策略扩展数据集，支持两阶段微调流程。

Result: 实验表明，DPSE在通用NLP基准和长期对话任务中均优于基线方法，消融研究验证了各模块的贡献。

Conclusion: DPSE为LLM的持续自进化提供了一条自主路径。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited to some extent
by pre-training, so some researchers optimize LLMs through post-training.
Existing post-training strategies, such as memory-based retrieval or preference
optimization, improve user alignment yet fail to enhance the model's domain
cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Dual-Phase Self-Evolution
(DPSE) framework that jointly optimizes user preference adaptation and
domain-specific competence. DPSE introduces a Censor module to extract
multi-dimensional interaction signals and estimate satisfaction scores, which
guide structured data expansion via topic-aware and preference-driven
strategies. These expanded datasets support a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline:
supervised domain grounding followed by frequency-aware preference
optimization. Experiments across general NLP benchmarks and long-term dialogue
tasks demonstrate that DPSE consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning,
Preference Optimization, and Memory-Augmented baselines. Ablation studies
validate the contribution of each module. In this way, our framework provides
an autonomous path toward continual self-evolution of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的AI文本检测器评估范式SHIELD，强调实际部署中的可靠性和稳定性，并开发了一种模型无关的人类化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法过于依赖传统指标（如AUROC），忽略了实际部署中的关键问题（如误报率和稳定性），导致检测系统实用性受限。

Method: SHIELD基准整合了可靠性和稳定性因素，并开发了一个可控的人类化框架，用于挑战现有检测方法。

Result: SHIELD在评估中有效突出了现有检测方法的不足，特别是在对抗性场景下的稳定性问题。

Conclusion: SHIELD为AI文本检测器的实际部署提供了更全面的评估标准，并通过人类化框架提升了检测挑战性。

Abstract: We present a novel evaluation paradigm for AI text detectors that prioritizes
real-world and equitable assessment. Current approaches predominantly report
conventional metrics like AUROC, overlooking that even modest false positive
rates constitute a critical impediment to practical deployment of detection
systems. Furthermore, real-world deployment necessitates predetermined
threshold configuration, making detector stability (i.e. the maintenance of
consistent performance across diverse domains and adversarial scenarios), a
critical factor. These aspects have been largely ignored in previous research
and benchmarks. Our benchmark, SHIELD, addresses these limitations by
integrating both reliability and stability factors into a unified evaluation
metric designed for practical assessment. Furthermore, we develop a post-hoc,
model-agnostic humanification framework that modifies AI text to more closely
resemble human authorship, incorporating a controllable hardness parameter.
This hardness-aware approach effectively challenges current SOTA zero-shot
detection methods in maintaining both reliability and stability. (Data and

Motivation: 研究动机在于调和AI对齐目标与LLMs左翼政治偏见的矛盾，揭示对齐原则与进步价值观的内在一致性。

Method: 通过分析对齐目标的规范性假设与政治意识形态的关系，论证左翼偏见的必然性。

Result: 研究发现对齐目标与左翼原则（如避免伤害、包容性）一致，而右翼意识形态与之冲突。

Conclusion: 结论指出，将左翼偏见视为风险实际上违背了AI对齐的HHH原则。

Abstract: The guiding principle of AI alignment is to train large language models
(LLMs) to be harmless, helpful, and honest (HHH). At the same time, there are
mounting concerns that LLMs exhibit a left-wing political bias. Yet, the
commitment to AI alignment cannot be harmonized with the latter critique. In
this article, I argue that intelligent systems that are trained to be harmless
and honest must necessarily exhibit left-wing political bias. Normative
assumptions underlying alignment objectives inherently concur with progressive
moral frameworks and left-wing principles, emphasizing harm avoidance,
inclusivity, fairness, and empirical truthfulness. Conversely, right-wing
ideologies often conflict with alignment guidelines. Yet, research on political
bias in LLMs is consistently framing its insights about left-leaning tendencies
as a risk, as problematic, or concerning. This way, researchers are actively
arguing against AI alignment, tacitly fostering the violation of HHH
principles.

TL;DR: 研究发现，多选问答（MCQA）对评估先进推理模型的下游性能不再可靠，尤其是当模型能在看到选项后进行推理时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MCQA是否仍能有效评估先进LLMs的下游性能，并分析其局限性。

Method: 系统评估15个问答基准和25个LLMs，测试5种提问方式，包括是否提供选项、是否允许链式推理等。

Result: MCQA仅在模型在提供选项前进行链式推理时有效；大模型在提供选项后推理会显著优于自由文本表现。

Conclusion: MCQA不再是评估先进模型下游性能的可靠指标，需设计更鲁棒、无偏见的基准。

Abstract: When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering domains,
it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called
multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of
interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to
choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes
automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging
benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This
paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for
state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$
different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different
LLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such
as Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of
presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple
choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes
replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform
chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA
remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they
were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented
with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large
models that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options
tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to
exploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a
good proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and
offer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks
that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 高质量本地数据和强大多语言嵌入可实现强审核性能，无需微调大型模型。模型权重和部分训练数据已公开。

Abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often
fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps
in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large
LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute. We present LionGuard 2, a
lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore
context, supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on
pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2
outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks,
including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is
actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical
efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust
multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without
fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training
data to support future work on LLM safety.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in metaphor interpretation across multiple datasets,
tasks, and prompt configurations. Although metaphor processing has gained
significant attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), previous research
has been limited to single-dataset evaluations and specific task settings,
often using artificially constructed data through lexical replacement. We
address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse
publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing
on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The
results indicate that LLMs' performance is more influenced by features like
lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating
that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language
are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning,
and linguistic knowledge. This work provides critical insights into the current
capabilities and limitations of LLMs in processing figurative language,
highlighting the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks in metaphor
interpretation tasks. Data and code are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音语言模型缺乏内部思考能力，而人类在交流前通常会进行复杂的心理推理。因此，为语音模型引入内部思考过程是必要的。

Method: 提出Stitch方法，交替生成未说出的推理块和语音响应块，利用语音播放的剩余时间生成推理内容，实现同时思考和说话。

Result: Stitch在数学推理数据集上比基线模型性能提升15%，在非推理数据集上表现与基线模型相当，且未增加延迟。

Conclusion: Stitch成功实现了语音模型的内部思考能力，同时保持了低延迟和高性能。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce
spoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an
internal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans
typically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to
communicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought
process into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking
for SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT
reasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a
novel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken
reasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a
chunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in
a chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the
unspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the
model continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving
simultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of
baselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those
baselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well
on non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models. Some animations and
demonstrations are on the project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH.

Motivation: 探究LLMs在训练数据较少的相关领域中识别算法相似问题的能力。

Method: 引入AlgoSimBench基准测试，包含1317个问题和402道多选题，提出ASM方法改进问题相似性检测。

Result: 最佳模型在MCQ任务中仅65.9%准确率，ASM方法提升6.7%至11.7%准确率。

Conclusion: ASM方法显著提升LLMs识别算法相似问题的能力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent progress in LLMs, such as reasoning models, has demonstrated strong
abilities to solve complex competitive programming problems, often rivaling top
human competitors. However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities
generalize to relevant domains that are less seen during training. To address
this, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs'
ability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can
be solved using similar algorithmic approaches. AlgoSimBench consists of 1317
problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which
we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents
one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but
algorithmically dissimilar distractors. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs
struggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving
only 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task. To address this challenge, we propose
attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem
similarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy
improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code
embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While
the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than
random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative
elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized
method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy. Code and data are available at

Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to power
digital assistants capable of complex action execution. These assistants rely
on pre-trained programming knowledge to execute multi-step goals by composing
objects and functions defined in assistant libraries into action execution

assistant library simulation and a human-assisted LLM data generation engine.
Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks
consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding
validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness
challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation
dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show
that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant
challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation.

Motivation: 训练式TTS方法（如持续强化学习）计算开销大，而无需训练的TTS方法逐渐被忽视。本文旨在探索无需训练的TTS方法在推理任务中的潜力。

Method: 设计了条件性步骤级自优化（一种细粒度序列扩展方法），并结合其他并行扩展方法，提出混合测试时间扩展（Hybrid TTS）范式。

Result: 在多个不同规模和家族的指令调优LLM上实验表明，混合策略能显著扩展模型的推理性能边界。

Conclusion: 无需训练的混合TTS方法在推理任务中具有巨大潜力，为LLM性能提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the
model's intelligence during inference. Recently, training-based TTS methods,
such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in
popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from
prominence. However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies
the burden on test-time scaling. In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS
methods for reasoning. We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement,
a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top
of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel
scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm
called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling. Extensive experiments on five
instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families
demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS
methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the
reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多语言文本去毒系统的评估方法，比较了自动指标与人工判断的差异，并提出了更可靠的评估流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在文本生成任务（如文本风格转换）的评估中存在挑战，尤其是多语言评估的研究较少。

Method: 通过九种语言的文本去毒系统，比较了基于神经网络的评估模型和基于提示的LLM评估方法。

Result: 研究发现自动指标与人工判断存在显著差距，并提出了改进多语言评估的实用建议。

Conclusion: 本文为多语言文本去毒系统的评估提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), evaluation of text
generation tasks such as text style transfer (TST) remains a significant
challenge. Recent studies (Dementieva et al., 2024; Pauli et al., 2025)
revealed a substantial gap between automatic metrics and human judgments.
Moreover, most prior work focuses exclusively on English, leaving multilingual
TST evaluation largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first
comprehensive multilingual study on evaluation of text detoxification system
across nine languages: English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi,
Ukrainian, Russian, Amharic. Drawing inspiration from the machine translation,
we assess the effectiveness of modern neural-based evaluation models alongside
prompting-based LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings provide a practical
recipe for designing more reliable multilingual TST evaluation pipeline in the
text detoxification case.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文学习（ICL）和视觉语言模型（VLM）的太赫兹（THz）图像分类方法，无需微调即可在低数据条件下提升分类效果和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹成像在安全筛查和材料分类等应用中具有非侵入性优势，但图像分类面临标注数据少、分辨率低和视觉模糊等挑战。

Method: 采用模态对齐的提示框架，将两种开源的视觉语言模型（VLM）适配到太赫兹领域，并在零样本和单样本设置下进行评估。

Result: 结果表明，上下文学习（ICL）在低数据条件下显著提升了分类性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: 这是首次将ICL增强的VLM应用于太赫兹成像，为资源受限的科学领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging enables non-invasive analysis for applications such
as security screening and material classification, but effective image
classification remains challenging due to limited annotations, low resolution,
and visual ambiguity. We introduce In-Context Learning (ICL) with
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a flexible, interpretable alternative that
requires no fine-tuning. Using a modality-aligned prompting framework, we adapt
two open-weight VLMs to the THz domain and evaluate them under zero-shot and
one-shot settings. Our results show that ICL improves classification and
interpretability in low-data regimes. This is the first application of
ICL-enhanced VLMs to THz imaging, offering a promising direction for
resource-constrained scientific domains. Code:

*Xinping Zhao,Shouzheng Huang,Yan Zhong,Xinshuo Hu,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEAR通过显式推理和提取机制减少检索噪声，提升LLMs生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索噪声显著影响LLMs生成质量，现有方法缺乏显式推理，易忽略关键线索且泛化能力差。

Method: LEAR结合推理和提取机制，通过端到端训练、知识标记掩码和奖励函数优化模型。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证了LEAR的有效性，生成紧凑高质量证据，提升下游任务准确性。

Conclusion: LEAR显著改善RAG系统性能，适用于在线应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively improves the accuracy of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, retrieval noises significantly impact
the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising
mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without
explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with
generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational
evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within
retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting
any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence
reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end
training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive
reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of
verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update
the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and
high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and
promoting effective application in online RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨叙事作为理解政治现实的解释工具，以及冲突性叙事如何揭示极化和议题对齐的话语机制。

Method: 基于德国Twitter数据（2021-2023），提取对立观点群体的文本信号，分析叙事冲突的两个维度：角色分配差异和情节编排差异。

Result: 发现叙事冲突的证据（如对北约在乌克兰战争中的不同解读）和叙事对齐的策略（如跨议题观点对齐）。

Conclusion: 叙事分析可作为研究极化话语机制的有效工具。

Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of
political reality. In this work, we show how the analysis of conflicting
narratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political
reality is experienced and told, provides insight into the discursive
mechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in the public sphere. Building
upon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the
German Twittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension
of polarization by extracting textual signals of conflicting narratives from
tweets of opposing opinion groups. Focusing on a selection of salient issues
and events (the war in Ukraine, Covid, climate change), we show evidence for
conflicting narratives along two dimensions: (i) different attributions of
actantial roles to the same set of actants (e.g. diverging interpretations of
the role of NATO in the war in Ukraine), and (ii) emplotment of different
actants for the same event (e.g. Bill Gates in the right-leaning Covid
narrative). Furthermore, we provide first evidence for patterns of narrative
alignment, a discursive strategy that political actors employ to align opinions
across issues. These findings demonstrate the use of narratives as an
analytical lens into the discursive mechanisms of polarization.

TL;DR: P3框架通过同时优化系统提示和用户提示，提升大语言模型性能，实验证明其在自动提示优化领域表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅优化系统或用户提示，效果有限，因为两者相互依赖。

Method: 提出P3框架，通过迭代过程同时优化系统提示和用户提示，并利用离线优化结果进行在线提示优化。

Result: 在通用任务和推理任务上，P3表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 整体优化策略能有效提升大语言模型在各领域的性能。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) applications often employ multi-component
prompts, comprising both system and user prompts, to guide model behaviors.
While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of automatically
optimizing either the system or user prompt to boost performance, such
unilateral approaches often yield suboptimal outcomes due to the interdependent
nature of these components. In this work, we introduce P3, a novel
self-improvement framework that concurrently optimizes both system and user
prompts through an iterative process. The offline optimized prompts are further
leveraged to promote online prompting by performing query-dependent prompt
optimization. Extensive experiments on general tasks (e.g., Arena-hard and
Alpaca-eval) and reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K and GPQA) demonstrate that P3
achieves superior performance in the realm of automatic prompt optimization.
Our results highlight the effectiveness of a holistic optimization strategy in
enhancing LLM performance across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出CoLD框架，通过长度惩罚、偏差估计器和联合训练策略，解决PRMs中的长度偏差问题，提升推理的准确性和简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRMs存在长度偏差，倾向于给更长的推理步骤更高评分，影响奖励预测的可靠性和推理输出的简洁性。

Method: 提出CoLD框架，包含显式长度惩罚调整、学习的偏差估计器和联合训练策略，基于反事实推理和因果图分析。

Result: 在MATH500和GSM-Plus上的实验表明，CoLD显著降低了奖励与长度的相关性，提升了步骤选择的准确性和推理的简洁性。

Conclusion: CoLD有效提升了PRMs的可靠性和鲁棒性，为多步推理提供了更准确的评估和指导。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding
multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for
mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in
existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps,
even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias
undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose
outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose
CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that
mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty
adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related
signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in
reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and
informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and
GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation,
improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically
valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality
of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文构建了新的信号博弈模型，使接收者能够真正理解组合信息，解决了传统模型中组合信息学习困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信号博弈模型中，接收者难以学习组合信息，即使信号发送者发送组合消息，接收者也无法组合理解。

Method: 提出了两种新模型：一种是仅从信号的原子消息中学习的最小化接收者，另一种是从所有可用信息中学习的通用接收者。

Result: 新模型比以往更简单，且接收者能够从消息的原子组件中学习。

Conclusion: 新模型成功实现了接收者对组合信息的真正理解。

Abstract: Receivers in standard signaling game models struggle with learning
compositional information. Even when the signalers send compositional messages,
the receivers do not interpret them compositionally. When information from one
message component is lost or forgotten, the information from other components
is also erased. In this paper I construct signaling game models in which
genuine compositional understanding evolves. I present two new models: a
minimalist receiver who only learns from the atomic messages of a signal, and a
generalist receiver who learns from all of the available information. These
models are in many ways simpler than previous alternatives, and allow the
receivers to learn from the atomic components of messages.

Motivation: 评估LLM在不同问题类型（如选择题、判断题、简答题）下的表现，填补了关于问题类型对LLM推理准确性影响的空白。

Method: 对五种LLM在三种问题类型上的表现进行定量和演绎推理任务测试，评估推理步骤准确性和最终答案选择准确性。

Result: 发现LLM在不同问题类型上表现差异显著；推理准确性与最终答案选择准确性无必然关联；选项数量和措辞影响LLM表现。

Conclusion: 问题类型对LLM推理任务表现有显著影响，需在设计评估时考虑问题类型和措辞。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been evaluated using diverse question
types, e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, and short/long answers. This study
answers an unexplored question about the impact of different question types on
LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. We investigate the performance of five LLMs on
three different types of questions using quantitative and deductive reasoning
tasks. The performance metrics include accuracy in the reasoning steps and
choosing the final answer. Key Findings: (1) Significant differences exist in
LLM performance across different question types. (2) Reasoning accuracy does
not necessarily correlate with the final selection accuracy. (3) The number of
options and the choice of words, influence LLM performance.

Result: 在英语任务中，Track A排名第9，Track B排名第6；在其他语言中表现优异。

Conclusion: 对比学习方法在跨语言情感检测任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了有效方向。

Abstract: The SemEval-2025 Task 11, Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection,
introduces an emotion recognition challenge spanning over 28 languages. This
competition encourages researchers to explore more advanced approaches to
address the challenges posed by the diversity of emotional expressions and
background variations. It features two tracks: multi-label classification
(Track A) and emotion intensity prediction (Track B), covering six emotion
categories: anger, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and disgust. In our work, we
systematically explore the benefits of two contrastive learning approaches:
sample-based (Contrastive Reasoning Calibration) and generation-based (DPO,
SimPO) contrastive learning. The sample-based contrastive approach trains the
model by comparing two samples to generate more reliable predictions. The
generation-based contrastive approach trains the model to differentiate between
correct and incorrect generations, refining its prediction. All models are
fine-tuned from LLaMa3-Instruct-8B. Our system achieves 9th place in Track A
and 6th place in Track B for English, while ranking among the top-tier
performing systems for other languages.

Result: 研究发现用户评估LLM的标准和问题类型，并据此构建了一个用于天文学领域的LLM评估基准样本。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLM评估提供了具体建议，有助于提升其在科学研究中的实用性。

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to aid in astronomy and other
scientific research, but benchmarks for LLM evaluation in general have not kept
pace with the increasingly diverse ways that real people evaluate and use these
models. In this study, we seek to improve evaluation procedures by building an
understanding of how users evaluate LLMs. We focus on a particular use case: an
LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation bot for engaging with astronomical
literature, which we deployed via Slack. Our inductive coding of 368 queries to
the bot over four weeks and our follow-up interviews with 11 astronomers reveal
how humans evaluated this system, including the types of questions asked and
the criteria for judging responses. We synthesize our findings into concrete
recommendations for building better benchmarks, which we then employ in
constructing a sample benchmark for evaluating LLMs for astronomy. Overall, our
work offers ways to improve LLM evaluation and ultimately usability,
particularly for use in scientific research.

Motivation: 现有眼科领域的LLM评估基准范围有限且过于注重准确性，BELO旨在提供更全面和标准化的评估工具。

Method: 通过关键词匹配和PubMedBERT模型从多个医学数据集中筛选眼科相关多选题，经过专家多轮检查和优化，最终形成900个问题。

Abstract: Current benchmarks evaluating large language models (LLMs) in ophthalmology
are limited in scope and disproportionately prioritise accuracy. We introduce
BELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive
evaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13
ophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and
reasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we
curated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse
medical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset
underwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard
questions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the
explanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by
three senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six
LLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)
using accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,
BARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human
experts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected
outputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900
high-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC
(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public
leaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and
reporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out,
evaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future
models.

Motivation: 现有基准测试未能全面评估LLMs在跨学科研究中的表现，限制了对其潜力的理解。

Method: IDRBench包含专家标注的数据集和任务，涵盖六个学科领域，评估任务分为三个阶段：IDR论文识别、IDR想法整合和IDR想法推荐。

Result: 测试10种LLMs后发现，尽管模型表现出一定的跨学科意识，但在生成高质量IDR想法方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: IDRBench为评估LLMs在跨学科研究中的表现提供了系统框架，并揭示了其局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed their
impressive ability to perform multi-step, logic-driven reasoning across complex
domains, positioning them as powerful tools and collaborators in scientific
discovery while challenging the long-held view that inspiration-driven ideation
is uniquely human. However, the lack of a dedicated benchmark that evaluates
LLMs' ability to develop ideas in Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) settings
poses a critical barrier to fully understanding their strengths and
limitations. To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering
benchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored
to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from
different scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark
aims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in
complex, cross-domain scientific research. Our dataset consists of scientific
publications sourced from the ArXiv platform covering six distinct disciplines,
and is annotated by domain experts with diverse academic backgrounds. To ensure
high-quality annotations, we emphasize clearly defined dimensions that
characterize authentic interdisciplinary research. The design of evaluation
tasks in IDRBench follows a progressive, real-world perspective, reflecting the
natural stages of interdisciplinary research development, including 1) IDR
Paper Identification, 2) IDR Idea Integration, and 3) IDR Idea Recommendation.
Using IDRBench, we construct baselines across 10 LLMs and observe that despite
fostering some level of IDR awareness, LLMs still struggle to produce quality
IDR ideas. These findings could not only spark new research directions, but
also help to develop next-generation LLMs that excel in interdisciplinary
research.

TL;DR: 本文从显著性检验的角度解释了TF-IDF的合理性，并证明其变体TF-ICF与Fisher精确检验的p值负对数密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为TF-IDF这一经典信息检索方法提供统计学理论基础，使其更易被统计学家理解和接受。

Method: 通过分析TF-ICF与Fisher精确检验的p值负对数的关系，并在理想假设下建立联系。

Result: 证明在无限大文档集合的极限情况下，TF-ICF收敛于TF-IDF。

Conclusion: TF-IDF的有效性可以通过Fisher精确检验的统计学视角得到解释，为统计学家提供了直观的理解方式。

Abstract: Term frequency-inverse document frequency, or TF-IDF for short, is arguably
the most celebrated mathematical expression in the history of information
retrieval. Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a
given term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of
many, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes
in diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship
dedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that
tradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community
by demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance
testing perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under
mild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the
$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical
significance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the
said negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We
further demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to
TF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's
exact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready
explanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少人工收集对话数据的时间和成本，推动对话AI研究。

Method: 使用种子提示初始化对话，测试多种LLM（包括专有和开源模型），并探索微调技术提升小模型性能。

Conclusion: DialogueForge有效生成模拟对话，但需进一步解决长对话连贯性问题。

Abstract: Collecting human-chatbot dialogues typically demands substantial manual
effort and is time-consuming, which limits and poses challenges for research on
conversational AI. In this work, we propose DialogueForge - a framework for
generating AI-simulated conversations in human-chatbot style. To initialize
each generated conversation, DialogueForge uses seed prompts extracted from
real human-chatbot interactions. We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the
human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to
small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to
specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the
ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We
evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different
models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show
that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in
generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g.,
Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We
demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly
improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless,
maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a
common challenge across all models.

Abstract: This paper introduces "Interaction as Intelligence" research series,
presenting a reconceptualization of human-AI relationships in deep research
tasks. Traditional approaches treat interaction merely as an interface for
accessing AI capabilities-a conduit between human intent and machine output. We
propose that interaction itself constitutes a fundamental dimension of
intelligence. As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research
tasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an
essential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems
adopt an "input-wait-output" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive
results after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade
effects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during
investigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address
these limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the
human role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement
where humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at
critical junctures. Deep cognition implements three key innovations:
(1)Transparent, controllable, and interruptible interaction that reveals AI
reasoning and enables intervention at any point; (2)Fine-grained bidirectional
dialogue; and (3)Shared cognitive context where the system observes and adapts
to user behaviors without explicit instruction. User evaluation demonstrates
that this cognitive oversight paradigm outperforms the strongest baseline
across six key metrics: Transparency(+20.0%), Fine-Grained Interaction(+29.2%),
Real-Time Intervention(+18.5%), Ease of Collaboration(+27.7%),
Results-Worth-Effort(+8.8%), and Interruptibility(+20.7%). Evaluations on
challenging research problems show 31.8% to 50.0% points of improvements over
deep research systems.

Abstract: We present Supernova, a 650M-parameter decoder-only transformer that
demonstrates how careful architectural design and tokenization innovation can
achieve the performance of larger models while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our architecture combines Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE),
Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with a 3:1 compression ratio, RMSNorm for

achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Through detailed analysis,
we show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models
while using 53% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens--an
order of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the
prevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and
tokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Archer提出了一种基于熵感知的RLVR方法，通过双令牌约束和同步更新，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法对所有令牌采用统一训练信号，忽略了知识相关令牌和推理相关令牌的不同作用，可能导致语义依赖断裂。

Method: Archer采用双令牌约束和同步更新，对推理令牌应用较弱的KL正则化和较高的剪裁阈值以鼓励探索，对知识令牌则施加更强约束以保持事实知识。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，Archer显著优于现有RLVR方法，达到或超越同类模型的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Archer通过熵感知和双令牌约束，有效解决了传统RLVR方法的局限性，提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become an effective
post-training method for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), mainly by shaping higher-order behaviors such as reflection and
planning. However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training
signals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy
knowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent
methods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous
updates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model
output and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an
entropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous
updates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher
clipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using
stronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge.
Experimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR
methods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of
comparable size. The code is available at

Conclusion: 储层计算在资源受限场景下是高效替代方案，但Transformer在性能上仍占优。需根据需求平衡资源与性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have dominated the science and media landscape
duo to their impressive performance on processing large chunks of data and
produce human-like levels of text. Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and
slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also
making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will
investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which
could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies
investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse.
In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level
language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an
output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures,
which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the
performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by
equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a
consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers
excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly
efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we
investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a
static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically
adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline
how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints
with performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，中英双语推理模型中的语言混合行为（如交替使用语言）能提升推理能力，强制单语解码会降低准确性。强化学习阶段是导致语言混合的关键，且轻量级探针可预测语言切换的利弊，提升推理准确性。

Motivation: 探讨语言混合行为在双语推理模型中的作用，验证其对推理能力的潜在益处。

Method: 研究中英双语模型的语言混合现象，通过强化学习阶段分析其成因，并设计轻量级探针预测语言切换的效果。

Result: 强制单语解码降低数学推理任务准确性5.6个百分点；探针引导解码可提升准确性6.25个百分点。

Conclusion: 语言混合是双语模型中的策略性推理行为，而非训练副产品，能显著提升推理能力。

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the
middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large
language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit
language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought.
Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy,
suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study
language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training
stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can
enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6
percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe
can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or
harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to
6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely
a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

Method: 开发了三个基准测试：1）源自阿拉伯语教材的自然STEM问答对；2）基于相同来源的合成STEM问题；3）通过人工翻译和审核构建的代码生成基准。

Result: 公开了三个高质量的阿拉伯语基准测试，支持相关领域的研究发展。

Conclusion: 3LM填补了阿拉伯语大语言模型在关键领域的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, yet efforts
to develop and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic remain
relatively limited. Most existing Arabic benchmarks focus on linguistic,
cultural, or religious content, leaving a significant gap in domains like STEM
and code which are increasingly relevant for real-world LLM applications. To
help bridge this gap, we present 3LM, a suite of three benchmarks designed
specifically for Arabic. The first is a set of STEM-related question-answer
pairs, naturally sourced from Arabic textbooks and educational worksheets. The
second consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the
same sources. The third benchmark focuses on code generation, built through a
careful translation of two widely used code benchmarks, incorporating a
human-in-the-loop process with several rounds of review to ensure high-quality
and faithful translations. We release all three benchmarks publicly to support
the growth of Arabic LLM research in these essential but underrepresented
areas.

Result: 重建轨道具有Lipschitz稳定性，数值实验表明误差与噪声水平线性相关，波速是影响相对误差的关键因素。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效重建移动轨道，适用于电磁学中的逆向问题。

Abstract: This paper is concerned with an inverse moving point source problem in
electromagnetics. The aim is to reconstruct the moving orbit from the
tangential components of magnetic fields taken at a finite number of
observation points. The distance function between each observation point and
the moving point source is computed by solving a nonlinear ordinary
differential equation with an initial value. This ODE system only involves the
measurement data from the tangential trace of the magnetic field at observation
points. As a consequence, the dynamical measurement data recorded at four
non-coplanar points are sufficient to reconstruct the orbit function. A
Lipschitz stability is established for the inverse problem, and numerical
experiments are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. Numerical examples have shown that the reconstructed error depends
linearly on the noise level and that the wave speed is a critical factor
affecting the relative error.

Abstract: Lin, Chan (High order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element
methods through subcell limiting, 2024) enforces a cell entropy inequality for
nodal discontinuous Galerkin methods by combining flux corrected transport
(FCT)-type limiting and a knapsack solver, which determines optimal limiting
coefficients that result in a semi-discrete cell entropy inequality while
preserving nodal bounds. In this work, we provide a slight modification of this
approach, where we utilize a quadratic knapsack problem instead of a standard
linear knapsack problem. We prove that this quadratic knapsack problem can be
reduced to efficient scalar root-finding. Numerical results demonstrate that
the proposed quadratic knapsack limiting strategy is efficient and results in a
semi-discretization with improved regularity in time compared with linear
knapsack limiting, while resulting in fewer adaptive timesteps in shock-type
problems.

Abstract: In many applications, one needs to learn a dynamical system from its
solutions sampled at a finite number of time points. The learning problem is
often formulated
  as an optimization problem over a chosen function class. However, in the
optimization procedure, it is necessary to employ a numerical scheme to
integrate candidate dynamical systems and assess how their solutions fit the
data.
  This paper reveals potentially serious effects of a chosen numerical scheme
on the learning outcome. In particular, our analysis demonstrates that a damped
oscillatory system may be incorrectly identified as having "anti-damping" and
exhibiting a reversed oscillation direction, despite adequately fitting the
given data points.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在低磁雷诺数区域中可靠地模拟了两相MHD问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We propose a novel mathematical framework for simulating the two-phase
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) problems. Focusing on low magnetic
Reynolds number regimes, where induced magnetic fields are negligible compared
to applied fields, an intrinsic sharp-interface system is first formulated.
Subsequently, we utilize the phase-field approach to characterize the interface
and derive a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model through the
Onsager's variational principle. The resulting system couples the
Abels--Garcke--Gr\"un (AGG) model of two-phase flows with a quasi-static
formulation modeling the electromagnetic phenomena. Theoretically, the
sharp-interface limit is investigated via asymptotic arguments, deducing that
the sharp-interface system can be recovered in the limit of vanishing interface
thickness. Consequently, this justifies the reliability of the phase-field
approach as an approximated method. In addition, we present some
three-dimensional numerical experiments of magnetic damping effects on bubble
dynamics, where the observed results demonstrate the validity of the proposed
framework in capturing complex MHD phenomena.

Abstract: The accurate modelling and simulation of electric devices involving
ferromagnetic materials requires the appropriate consideration of magnetic
hysteresis. We discuss the systematic incorporation of the energy-based vector
hysteresis model of Henrotte et al. into vector potential formulations for the
governing magnetic field equations. The field model describing a single step in
a load cycle is phrased as a convex minimization problem which allows us to
establish existence and uniqueness of solutions and to obtain accurate
approximations by finite element discretization. Consistency of the model with
the governing field equations is deduced from the first order optimality
conditions. In addition, two globally convergent iterative methods are
presented for the solution of the underlying minimization problems. The
efficiency of the approach is illustrated by numerical tests for a typical
benchmark problem.

Method: 开发了一种通用的插值误差分析方法，假设存在具有合适$L^2$精度的宏观问题。

Result: 在高度振荡周期性系数下，插值误差为$\mathcal{O}\left(H+\frac{\epsilon}{H}\right)$，其中$\epsilon$为周期大小，$H$为粗网格尺寸。

Conclusion: 分析方法独立于一阶校正器或单元问题的解，仅依赖于均化解及其最小正则性，适用于高度振荡系数问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximation properties of two types of
multiscale finite element methods with oversampling as proposed in [Hou \& Wu,
{\textit{J. Comput. Phys.}}, 1997] and [Efendiev, Hou \& Wu, \textit{SIAM J.
Numer. Anal.}, 2000] without scale separation. We develop a general
interpolation error analysis for elliptic problems with highly oscillatory
rough coefficients, under the assumption of the existence of a macroscopic
problem with suitable $L^2$-accuracy. The distinct features of the analysis, in
the setting of highly oscillatory periodic coefficients, include: (i) The
analysis is independent of the first-order corrector or the solutions to the
cell problems, and thus independent of their regularity properties; (ii) The
analysis only involves the homogenized solution and its minimal regularity. We
derive an interpolation error $\mathcal{O}\left(H+\frac{\epsilon}{H}\right)$
with $\epsilon$ and $H$ being the period size and the coarse mesh size,
respectively, when the oversampling domain includes one layer of elements from
the target coarse element.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive global spectral analysis of the
convection dispersion equation, which is also referred to in specific contexts
as the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation, to investigate the behaviour of high
order numerical schemes across a wide range of nondimensional parameters. The
motivation for this analysis stems from the equation's importance in modeling
wave propagation and transport phenomena, where accurate resolution of
dispersive effects is critical, and traditional numerical schemes often suffer
from spurious artifacts. We analyze one sixth order and two eighth order
compact spatial discretization schemes, encompassing both node centered and
cell centered formulations, combined with a third order strong stability
preserving Runge Kutta (SSPRK3) time integrator. The analysis is performed in
terms of key nondimensional parameters such as the wavenumber, Courant
Friedrichs Lewy number $N_c$, and dispersion number $D_{\alpha}$ over the full
spectral plane for both one and two dimensional cases. Key numerical
indicators, including the amplification factor, normalized phase speed, and
normalized group velocity, are evaluated to characterize stability, dispersion
error, errors in energy transport, and directional anisotropy. Critical
dispersion thresholds and Courant numbers are identified, beyond which
numerical instability and nonphysical phenomena such as spurious q waves and
reversed phase or energy transport arise. Theoretical predictions are validated
through numerical experiments involving linear and nonlinear one and two
dimensional test problems, including cases with exact solutions and established
benchmark results. This comprehensive analysis uncovers subtle numerical errors
and offers practical guidance for selecting reliable discretization parameters,
ensuring accurate and stable simulations of convection dispersion systems.

Abstract: Reactive, semi-permeable interfaces play important roles in key biological
processes such as targeted drug delivery, lipid metabolism, and signal
transduction. These systems involve coupled surface reactions, transmembrane
transport, and interfacial deformation, often triggered by local biochemical
signals. The strong mechanochemical couplings complicate the modeling of such
interfacial dynamics. We propose a thermodynamically consistent continuum
framework that integrates bulk fluid motion, interfacial dynamics, surface
chemistry, and selective solute exchange, derived via an energy variation
approach to ensure mass conservation and energy dissipation. To efficiently
solve the resulting coupled system, we develop a finite element scheme within
an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework, incorporating the
Barrett-Garcke-Nurnberg (BGN) strategy to maintain mesh regularity and preserve
conservation laws. Numerical experiments verify the convergence and
conservation properties of the scheme and demonstrate its ability in capturing
complex interfacial dynamics. Two biologically inspired examples showcase the
model's versatility: cholesterol efflux via the ABCG1 pathway, involving
multistage interfacial reactions and HDL uptake; and a self-propelled droplet
system with reaction-activated permeability, mimicking drug release in
pathological environments. This work provides a unified computational platform
for studying strongly coupled biochemical and mechanical interactions at
interfaces, offering new insights into reactive transport processes in both
biological and industrial contexts.

Conclusion: SQQ-PTQ在精度、稳定性和计算效率方面均表现出色，是一种高效的辛积分算法。

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive symplectic integrator, SQQ-PTQ, developed on
the basis of the fixed-step symplectic integrator SQQ. To mitigate the Runge
phenomenon, SQQ-PTQ employs Chebyshev interpolation for approximating the
action, enhancing both the precision and stability of the interpolation. In
addition, to reduce the computational cost of evaluating interpolation
functions, SQQ-PTQ introduces a projection method that improves the efficiency
of these computations. A key feature of SQQ-PTQ is its use of the time
transformation to implement an adaptive time step. To address the challenge of
computing complicated Jacobian matrices attributed to the time transformation,
SQQ-PTQ adopts a quasi-Newton method based on Broyden's method. This strategy
accelerates the solution of nonlinear equations, thereby improving the overall
computational performance. The effectiveness and robustness of SQQ-PTQ are
demonstrated via three numerical experiments. In particular, SQQ-PTQ
demonstrates adaptability in handling close-encounter problems. Moreover,
during long-term integrations, SQQ-PTQ maintains the energy conservation,
further confirming its advantages as a symplectic algorithm.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) equation is a classical
reaction-diffusion equation with broad applications such as biology, chemistry
and physics. In this paper, an alternative second-order scheme is proposed by
employing a shifted BDF2 method to approximate the two-dimensional (modified)
Fisher-KPP equation. We both consider an uniform and a nonuniform time steps of
such the scheme. The stability of the uniform discretization scheme is proved.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that our uniform and non-uniform schemes are
robust and accurate.

Motivation: 研究非牛顿流体在非稳态条件下的数值模拟，特别是运动压力的误差分析，以验证离散方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用全离散有限差分/有限元方法，结合Lagrange乘子或离散速度空间处理边界条件，利用离散Leray投影进行误差分析。

Conclusion: $	extit{a priori}$误差分析在速度和压力正则性降低时仍保持鲁棒性，揭示了边界条件与投影稳定性对压力近似精度的影响。

Abstract: We present an $\textit{a priori}$ error analysis for the kinematic pressure
in a fully-discrete finite-differences/-elements discretization of the unsteady
$p$-Stokes equations, modelling non-Newtonian fluids. This system is subject to
both impermeability and perfect Navier slip boundary conditions, which are
incorporated either weakly via Lagrange multipliers or strongly in the discrete
velocity space. A central aspect of the $\textit{a priori}$ error analysis is
the discrete Leray projection, constructed to quantitatively approximate its
continuous counterpart. The discrete Leray projection enables a Helmholtz-type
decomposition at the discrete level and plays a key role in deriving error
decay rates for the kinematic pressure. We derive (in some cases optimal) error
decay rates for both the velocity vector field and kinematic pressure, with the
error for the kinematic pressure measured in an $\textit{ad hoc}$ norm informed
by the projection framework. The $\textit{a priori}$ error analysis remains
robust even under reduced regularity of the velocity vector field and the
kinematic pressure, and illustrates how the interplay of boundary conditions
and projection stability governs the accuracy of pressure approximations.

Abstract: We develop and analyze numerical methods for a stochastic Keller-Segel system
perturbed by Stratonovich noise, which models chemotactic behavior under
randomly fluctuating environmental conditions. The proposed fully discrete
scheme couples a Crank-Nicolson time discretization with a splitting mixed
finite element method in space. We rigorously prove the stability of the
numerical scheme and establish strong convergence rates of order $O(k^{1/2} +
k^{-1/2}h^2)$, where $k$ and $h$ denote the time and spatial step sizes,
respectively. Notably, the presence of stochastic forcing leads to an inverse
dependence on $k$ in the error estimates, distinguishing the convergence
behavior from that of the deterministic case. Numerical experiments are
presented to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness
and accuracy of the proposed methods.

Abstract: In this paper, a theoretical framework is presented
  for the use of a Kansa-like method to numerically solve elliptic
  partial differential equations on spheres and other manifolds. The
  theory addresses both the stability of the method and provides error
  estimates for two different approximation methods. A Kansa-like
  matrix is obtained by replacing the test point set $X$, used in the
  traditional Kansa method, by a larger set $Y$, which is a norming
  set for the underlying trial space. This gives rise to a rectangular
  matrix. In addition, if a basis of Lagrange (or local Lagrange)
  functions is used for the trial space, then it is shown
  that the stability of the matrix is comparable to the stability of
  the elliptic operator acting on the trial space. Finally, two
  different types of error estimates are given. Discrete least squares
  estimates of very high accuracy are obtained for solutions that are
  sufficiently smooth. The second method, giving similar error
  estimates, uses a rank revealing factorization to create a
  ``thinning algorithm'' that reduces $\#Y$ to $\#X$. In practice,
  this algorithm doesn't need $Y$ to be a norming set.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分位数的随机Kaczmarz（QRK）子采样方法，显著减少了计算量，同时保持了收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QRK方法需要计算所有样本的分位数，计算量大，限制了其效率。本文旨在通过子采样解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出子采样QRK，每次迭代从均匀采样的D个样本中计算分位数，理论证明D只需对数级大小即可保证收敛。

Result: 理论证明子采样QRK在前T次迭代中以高概率线性收敛，且D的大小显著减少至对数级。

Conclusion: 子采样QRK在计算效率上有显著提升，且理论证明其收敛性，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Quantile-based randomized Kaczmarz (QRK) was recently introduced to
efficiently solve sparsely corrupted linear systems $\mathbf{A}
\mathbf{x}^*+\mathbf{\epsilon} = \mathbf{b}$ [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl.,
43(2), 605-637], where $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and
$\mathbf{\epsilon}$ is an arbitrary $(\beta m)$-sparse corruption. However, all
existing theoretical guarantees for QRK require quantiles to be computed using
all $m$ samples (or a subsample of the same order), thus negating the
computational advantage of Kaczmarz-type methods. This paper overcomes the
bottleneck. We analyze a subsampling QRK, which computes quantiles from $D$
uniformly chosen samples at each iteration. Under some standard scaling
assumptions on the coefficient matrix, we show that QRK with subsample size
$D\ge\frac{C\log (T)}{\log(1/\beta)}$ linearly converges over the first $T$
iterations with high probability, where $C$ is some absolute constant. This
subsample size is a substantial reduction from $O(m)$ in prior results. For
instance, it translates into $O(\log(n))$ even if an approximation error of
$\exp(-n^2)$ is desired. Intriguingly, our subsample size is also tight up to a
multiplicative constant: if $D\le \frac{c\log(T)}{\log(1/\beta)}$ for some
constant $c$, the error of the $T$-th iterate could be arbitrarily large with
high probability. Numerical results are provided to corroborate our theory.

Motivation: 探索低秩时间积分器在双曲和抛物方程中的稳定性，为复杂系统（如动力学理论）提供理论支持。

Method: 使用冯·诺依曼分析，结合标准空间离散化（如迎风和中心差分），比较DtP和PtD的稳定性。

Result: 双曲方程中，DtP和PtD的稳定性条件相同，Strang分裂可显著扩大稳定区域；抛物方程中，通过Crank-Nicolson或混合欧拉方法可实现无条件稳定。

Conclusion: PSI在简化模型中的稳定性分析为复杂系统提供了重要参考。

Abstract: We study the stability of a class of dynamical low-rank methods--the
projector-splitting integrator (PSI)--applied to linear hyperbolic and
parabolic equations. Using a von Neumann-type analysis, we investigate the
stability of such low-rank time integrator coupled with standard spatial
discretizations, including upwind and central finite difference schemes, under
two commonly used formulations: discretize-then-project (DtP) and
project-then-discretize (PtD). For hyperbolic equations, we show that the
stability conditions for DtP and PtD are the same under Lie-Trotter splitting,
and that the stability region can be significantly enlarged by using Strang
splitting. For parabolic equations, despite the presence of a negative S-step,
unconditional stability can still be achieved by employing Crank-Nicolson or a
hybrid forward-backward Euler scheme in time stepping. While our analysis
focuses on simplified model problems, it offers insight into the stability
behavior of PSI for more complex systems, such as those arising in kinetic
theory.

Conclusion: 正则化方法有效解决了非光滑项的计算问题，同时保持了模型精度，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The energy-based vector hysteresis model of Francois-Lavet et al. establishes
an implicit relation between magnetic fields and fluxes via internal magnetic
polarizations which are determined by convex but non-smooth minimization
problems. The systematic solution of these problems for every material point is
a key ingredient for the efficient implementation of the model into standard
magnetic field solvers. We propose to approximate the non-smooth terms via
regularization which allows to employ standard Newton methods for the
evaluation of the local material models while being in control of the error in
this approximation. We further derive the inverse of the regularized hysteresis
operator which amounts to a regularized version of the inverse hysteresis
model. The magnetic polarizations in this model are again determined by local
minimization problems which here are coupled across the different pinning
forces. An efficient algorithm for solving the Newton systems is proposed which
allows evaluation of the inverse hysteresis operator at the same cost as the
forward model. Numerical tests on standard benchmark problems are presented for
illustration of our results.

Conclusion: Anderson加速法在复杂和大规模问题中显著减少迭代次数和计算时间，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This work investigates the local convergence behavior of Anderson
acceleration in solving nonlinear systems. We establish local R-linear
convergence results for Anderson acceleration with general depth $m$ under the
assumptions that the Jacobian of the nonlinear operator is H\"older continuous
and the corresponding fixed-point function is contractive. In the Lipschitz
continuous case, we obtain a sharper R-linear convergence factor. We also
derive a refined residual bound for the depth $m = 1$ under the same
assumptions used for the general depth results. Applications to a nonsymmetric
Riccati equation from transport theory demonstrate that Anderson acceleration
yields comparable results to several existing fixed-point methods for the
regular cases, and that it brings significant reductions in both the number of
iterations and computation time, even in challenging cases involving nearly
singular or large-scale problems.

Abstract: This study presents a numerical analysis of the Field-Noyes
reaction-diffusion model with nonsmooth initial data, employing a linear
Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization and a second-order
exponential Runge-Kutta scheme for temporal integration. The initial data are
assumed to reside in the fractional Sobolev space H^gamma with 0 < gamma < 2,
where classical regularity conditions are violated, necessitating specialized
error analysis. By integrating semigroup techniques and fractional Sobolev
space theory, sharp fully discrete error estimates are derived in both L2 and
H1 norms. This demonstrates that the convergence order adapts to the smoothness
of initial data, a key advancement over traditional approaches that assume
higher regularity. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical

collocation method in solving differential equations and identify the
superconvergence points both for function and derivative values. Numerical

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a central role in describing many
physical phenomena. Various scientific and engineering applications demand a
versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions
with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and
specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for
solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model
for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1
model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational
graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The
mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary
spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to
pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs
with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of
variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for
PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs,
PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has
smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2
can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable
nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover
coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法显著提高了收敛速度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 几何感知的神经预处理器训练策略有效解决了混合维问题的收敛问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a geometry-aware strategy for training neural preconditioners
tailored to parametrized linear systems arising from the discretization of
mixed-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). These systems are
typically ill-conditioned because of the presence of embedded lower-dimensional
structures and are solved using Krylov subspace methods. Our approach yields an
approximation of the inverse operator employing a learning algorithm consisting
of a two-stage training framework: an initial static pre-training phase, based
on residual minimization, followed by a dynamic fine-tuning phase that
incorporates solver convergence dynamics into training via a novel loss
functional. This dynamic loss is defined by the principal angles between the
residuals and the Krylov subspaces. It is evaluated using a differentiable
implementation of the Flexible GMRES algorithm, which enables backpropagation
through both the Arnoldi process and Givens rotations. The resulting neural
preconditioner is explicitly optimized to improve early-stage convergence and
reduce iteration counts in a family of 3D-1D mixed-dimensional problems with
geometric variability of the 1D domain. Numerical experiments show that our
solver-aligned approach significantly improves convergence rate, robustness,
and generalization.

Conclusion: 结合PINNs与策略迭代是解决高维非凸HJI方程的有效方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework that combines classical
dynamic programming with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve
high-dimensional, nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs (HJI) equations arising in
stochastic differential games and robust control. The method alternates between
solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the
controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation.
Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the
value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity
solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz
regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without
requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic
path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference
benchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and
ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise,
the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding
smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that
integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically
grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with
potential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement
learning.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a real-time diagnostic modality that reconstructs
acoustic signals into visual representations of internal body structures. A key
component in this process is beamforming, with the Delay and Sum (DAS)
algorithm being a standard due to its balance between simplicity and
effectiveness. However, the computational cost of DAS can be a limiting factor,
especially in real-time scenarios where fast frame reconstruction is essential.
In this work, we introduce a time-invariant approximation of the DAS algorithm
(tiDAS), designed to accelerate the reconstruction process without compromising
image quality. By adopting a one-dimensional, row-wise convolutional
formulation, tiDAS significantly reduces computational complexity while
preserving the core properties of the original model. This approach not only
enables faster image reconstruction but also provides a structured foundation
for the application of deconvolution methods aimed at enhancing resolution.
Synthetic experiments demonstrate that tiDAS achieves a favorable trade-off
between speed and accuracy, making it a promising tool for improving the
efficiency of real-time ultrasound imaging.

Motivation: 缺氧区域对传统疗法具有抗性，缺氧激活前药是一种有前景的策略，但其行为建模复杂，需要解决氧气、药物激活和细胞存活之间的相互作用。

Method: 开发了一个多尺度混合维度模型，结合血液流动、氧气扩散与消耗、药物输送和代谢，通过单向耦合降低计算成本。

Result: 模型能够高效模拟缺氧激活前药的行为，并通过全局敏感性分析识别关键参数。

Conclusion: 该方法为优化缺氧靶向治疗提供了高效模拟工具。

Abstract: Hypoxia-activated prodrugs offer a promising strategy for targeting
oxygen-deficient regions in solid tumors, which are often resistant to
conventional therapies. However, modeling their behavior is challenging because
of the complex interplay between oxygen availability, drug activation, and cell
survival. In this work, we develop a multiscale and mixed-dimensional model
that couples spatially resolved drug and oxygen transport with pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics to simulate the cellular response. The model integrates
blood flow, oxygen diffusion and consumption, drug delivery, and metabolism. To
reduce computational cost, we mitigate the global nonlinearity through a
one-way coupling of the multiscale and mixed/dimensional models with a reduced
0D model for the drug metabolism. The global sensitivity analysis is then used
to identify key parameters influencing drug activation and therapeutic outcome.
This approach enables efficient simulation and supports the design of optimized
hypoxia-targeted therapies.

Result: 结果表明，高哈特曼数促进二维流动，高理查德森数增强三维性；棱柱取向3在传热方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了流动动力学与传热的强耦合关系，为MHD流动的优化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study numerically investigates the flow evolution and heat transfer
characteristics of an electrically conducting fluid over triangular prisms
confined between two parallel plates with a heated bottom plate under the
influence of a magnetic field. The research focuses on the three-dimensional
behavior of MHD flows at low Hartmann numbers ($Ha$), exploring how obstacle
orientation and mixed convection influence flow dynamics and heat transfer.
Three-dimensional simulations are performed using an in-house MHD solver in
OpenFOAM at a constant channel height based Reynolds number ($Re_{h}=600$). The
combined effects of Richardson number ($Ri$) and $Ha$ on wake dynamics and heat
transfer are analyzed for three triangular prism orientations. The results
reveal that increasing $Ha$ promotes flow two-dimensionality, while higher $Ri$
enhances three-dimensionality. Three wake instability modes (Mode A, B, and C)
are identified. Orientation 2 exhibits the lowest mean drag coefficient at
$Ha=0$, $Ri=5$, while the highest mean lift coefficient is observed at $Ha=0$,
$Ri=0$. Orientation 3 achieves the highest heat transfer rate, with an average
Nusselt number of $21.05$ at $Ha=25$, $Ri=5$, and consistently outperforms the
other orientations in heat transfer across various $Ha$ and $Ri$ conditions.
These findings highlight the strong coupling between wake dynamics and heat
transfer, offering insights for optimizing MHD flows in practical applications.

Conclusion: WPTS是一种高效且高保真的湍流模拟工具，适用于复杂工程流动配置，为工业应用提供了计算效率高的替代方案。

Abstract: Spatially developing round jet flows are fundamental to numerous engineering
applications. This letter applies the wave-particle turbulence simulation
(WPTS) method, a recently developed multiscale approach, to simulate a
spatially developing circular jet at Reynolds number 5000, a canonical
configuration for validating turbulence models. The study aims to further
establish the effectiveness and accuracy of WPTS for shear-driven turbulent
flows. WPTS employs a multiscale framework that couples wave and particle
components, where the wave component captures cell-resolved flow structures
while the particle component models sub-grid flow information through
non-equilibrium transport. Using a computational grid containing only 2% of the
cells required for direct numerical simulation (DNS), WPTS successfully
predicts both qualitative flow features and quantitative turbulence statistics,
including: the characteristic linear decay of centerline velocity, radial
profiles of mean velocity, and anisotropic Reynolds stress components. The
results demonstrate excellent agreement with DNS data and experimental
measurements. These findings establish WPTS as an effective computational tool
for turbulence simulation, capable of maintaining high fidelity in capturing
essential turbulence characteristics while utilizing significantly coarser
grids than traditional methods. The successful application to turbulent jet
flow demonstrates the method's potential for extension to more complex
engineering flow configurations, offering a computationally efficient
alternative for industrial applications.

Result: 鸟类翅膀能抑制流动分离并保持稳定流结构，使刚性飞行器模型具有更广的稳定性范围。

Conclusion: 鸟类翅膀的气动特性支持稳定飞行，减少主动控制需求，降低飞行成本。

Abstract: Birds rely on active high-acceleration morphing and flapping to navigate
complex airflows, but they can also maintain stable fixed-wing postures under
persistent atmospheric disturbances. Here, we show that avian wings exhibit
aerodynamic adaptivity to incoming flow variations, characterized by a gentler
lift curve slope, a wider operative angle of attack range, and turbulence
insensitivity, compared to engineered airfoil wings across varying angles of
attack and turbulence intensities. This adaptivity stems from the consistent
flow structures around avian wings under different turbulence intensities and
their ability to suppress flow separation at high angles of attack.
Longitudinal dynamic stability analysis further reveals that avian aerodynamic
characteristics enable the corresponding modeled rigid flyers to maintain a
broader stability envelope. This stability supports stable fixed-wing flight in
real turbulent environments while reducing the need for active control, thereby
minimizing flight cost.

Conclusion: SSPIV系统能高效获取高分辨率三维速度场，适用于复杂流场研究，实验结果与数值模拟吻合较好。

Abstract: We introduce a Scanning Stereoscopic Particle Image velocimetry~(SSPIV)
system which incorporates a thin rotating prism to obtain three-dimensional
velocity fields in a large cubical measurement volume. The system makes use of
an arrangement where a laser beam is first laterally deflected using an
even-faced prism, and then passed through a cylindrical lens rod to obtain
light sheets for illumination. This eliminates the need for large rotating
mirrors or heavy prisms and facilitates relatively fast rotation speeds of up
to 4800 rpm for the prism, yielding three-dimensional, three-component velocity
field over a large depth at relatively high particle seeding density. About
$10^6$ velocity vectors (3D-3C) are obtained in a single volumetric-scan of
$100 \times 100 \times 100$ mm$^3$. The method is demonstrated using two
independent experiments, (1) a round jet at Reynolds number Re = 1000, and (2)
the flow field around a freely rising sphere at a Reynolds number Re$_p$
$\approx$ 260, and the wake flow is compared with direct numerical simulations
of a falling viscous droplet. The scanning gives time-resolved evolution of the
large-scale vortical structures of the Re = 1000 jet, with spatial gradients
captured fairly well. The three-dimensional flow field surrounding the
refractive-index-matched rising sphere is shown to be steady and
non-axisymmetric. The flow field and separation bubble are seen to be similar,
but slightly shorter than that of the falling droplet case and the uniform flow
past a fixed sphere case at a comparable Reynolds number.

Abstract: Stably stratified shear flows, where the base velocity shear is
quasi-continuously forced externally, can arise in many geophysically relevant
circumstances. It is important to determine the emergent dynamics of the
ensuing statistically steady stratified turbulence. We investigate this
phenomenon in a series of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations using
spectral element methods. We force the flow to relax back towards vertical
hyperbolic tangent profiles of streamwise velocity and buoyancy, with
characteristic half-depth $\dO$, half-velocity jump $\UO$, and half-buoyancy
jump $\BO$, with a relaxation time $t_r=100 \tauadv$ where $\tauadv:=\dO/\UO$.
We consider computational domains of vertical extent $\Gz=48$ with a range of
horizontal extents $16\leq\Gh\leq512$. We simulate a fluid with Prandtl number
$\Pr:=\nu/\kappa=1$, and set the initial bulk Reynolds number
$\ReO:=\UO\dO/\nu=50$ and Richardson number $\RiO:=\BO\dO/\UO^{2}=1/80$. At
these parameters, the flow is initially unstable to a primary Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. We simulate the continuously forced flow over about $5000\tauadv$,
and investigate the dynamically emergent length scales and turbulence
properties of the statistically stationary flow, in particular the local
turbulent flux coefficient. We find that the shear layer half depth converges
to $d\approx8$ with markedly increased $\Re\approx400$ and associated
convergent vertical mixing properties only for $\Gh\gtrsim\Ghcrit=96$. However,
emergent dominant yet large-scale spanwise or streamwise flow structures appear
to extend up to $\Lambda_{y}\approx50$ or even $\Lambda_{x}\approx115$,
respectively. Our observations demonstrate the marked anisotropy of
characteristic emergent length scales, and are consistent with the possibility
that an `imprint' of the primary instability continues to survive in such
turbulent flows.

Motivation: 传统上，RSS的形成归因于对称不稳定性（SI），但SI理论无法解释RSS的平衡问题。本文旨在通过SSD框架结合雷诺应力（RS）扭矩机制，更全面地理解RSS的动态过程。

Method: 采用统计状态动力学（SSD）框架，结合非线性分析，研究RSS的形成、平衡和维持机制。

Result: 研究发现，当理查德森数Ri < 1时，RS扭矩机制与SI机制协同作用；当Ri > 1时，RS扭矩机制仍支持RSS形成。SSD框架能一致地描述RSS的平衡过程。

Conclusion: SSD框架为湍流RSS的形成、平衡和维持提供了更全面的理论支持，弥补了SI理论的不足。

Abstract: Streamwise roll circulations commonly observed in frontal regions are primary
agents of momentum and tracer transport in the planetary boundary layer (PBL)
both in the atmosphere and ocean. Traditionally, the formation of the
streamwise roll/streak structure (RSS) has been ascribed to symmetric
instability (SI). In part 1, we studied RSS formation in the classical Eady
front problem using statistical state dynamics (SSD), which allows
incorporating the Reynolds stress (RS) torque instability mechanism together
with SI in the dynamics underlying RSS formation. We found using SSD theory
that the RS torque mechanism acts synergistically with the SI mechanism in
forcing symmetric circulations in fronts when Richardson number Ri < 1, and
also that the turbulence-mediated RS torque mechanism supports RSS formation in
fronts with Ri > 1 for which the SI mechanism does not operate. Although SI
theory provides an explanation for initial roll formation, it leaves open the
question of RSS equilibration. An advantage of the SSD formulation of RSS
dynamics is that it consistently incorporates the equilibration process. In
this paper, we extend perturbation analysis of RSS dynamics in the SSD
framework to a nonlinear analysis to understand roll formation, equilibration,
and maintenance in the turbulent RSS regime.

Conclusion: 壁面润湿性可作为被动控制机制，优化空化行为和流动稳定性。

Abstract: This study investigates the role of wall wettability, characterized by the
wall contact angle (WCA), in controlling cavitation dynamics and stability
around a Clark Y hydrofoil. High-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations (LES) coupled
with a dynamic contact angle model were employed within the OpenFOAM framework
to explore WCAs ranging from hydrophilic ($0^\circ$) to superhydrophobic
($160^\circ$) under distinct cavitation numbers ($\sigma = 1.6$, $0.8$, and
$0.4$), representing incipient, cloud, and supercavitation regimes,
respectively. The results show that increasing WCA consistently promotes
earlier cavitation inception, thicker cavity development, and greater flow
unsteadiness. For $\sigma = 1.6$, higher WCAs led to smaller, detached vapor
bubbles and localized pressure fluctuations. At $\sigma = 0.8$,
superhydrophobic surfaces caused more extensive vapor structures, intensified
shedding dynamics, and stronger pressure fluctuations. For $\sigma = 0.4$, high
WCAs facilitated stable, wall-adhered cavities that suppressed re-entrant jet
activity and reduced unsteady loading. These findings demonstrate that surface
wettability serves as an effective passive control mechanism for tailoring
cavitation behavior and optimizing flow stability in engineering applications.

Conclusion: 结冰后掠翼的气动力主要由后掠角引起的展向流动和剪切层动力学决定，根部和翼尖区域影响较小。

Abstract: This study employs an improved delayed detached eddy simulation (AMD-IDDES)
method to investigate the flow characteristics of an iced swept wing. The
AMD-IDDES approach incorporates an anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model
into the traditional IDDES framework to better account for local flow
anisotropy and energy dissipation characteristics. The method is validated
against the traditional IDDES approach, and the results show that AMD-IDDES
more accurately captures the evolution of vortices and separated shear layers.
Compared with an iced straight wing, a swept wing exhibits distinct aerodynamic
behavior driven mainly by the sweep angle. The sweep angle induces strong
spanwise flow, which reshapes the separation region and transforms the flow
from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. This spanwise motion significantly
alters vortex development and enhances the complexity of the unsteady flow. The
shear layer separation, initiated by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, dominates
the unsteady aerodynamic response. Although wingtip effects remain secondary,
their interaction with the leading-edge vortex still contributes to lowering
the dominant frequency. Overall, this study highlights that the aerodynamic
forces of an iced swept wing are primarily governed by sweep-induced spanwise
flow and associated shear layer dynamics, with minimal influence from the root
and tip regions.

Abstract: We study the role of turbulence in enhancing the collisions of droplets
within the cloud droplet bottleneck range. To this end, we perform direct
numerical simulations of polydisperse inertial particles suspended in
three-dimensional turbulence at high Reynolds number. Our analysis reveals that
polydispersity enhances collisions of light droplets, but attenuates collisions
at larger Stokes numbers by reducing the degree of inertial clustering and
weakening the sling effect. We present a novel parameterization for the
bidisperse collision kernel which blends the mechanisms related to inertial
clustering and the sling effect with polydispersity. We then demonstrate that
the droplet size distribution of typical cloud droplets is effectively
broadened by turbulence and that droplet growth may be accelerated
significantly by turbulent intermittency--a condition that the here provided
theoretical contemplations in conjunction with recent measurements in clouds
suggest is likely.

Abstract: Riparian vegetation along riverbanks and seagrass along coastlines interact
with water currents, significantly altering their flow. To characterise the
turbulent fluid motion along the streamwise-edge of a region covered by
submerged vegetation (canopy), we perform direct numerical simulations of a
half-channel partially obstructed by flexible stems, vertically clamped to the
bottom wall. An intense streamwise vortex forms along the canopy edge, drawing
high-momentum fluid into the side of the canopy and ejecting low-momentum fluid
from the canopy tip, in an upwelling close to the canopy edge. This mechanism
has a profound impact on the mean flow and on the exchange of momentum between
the fluid and the structure, which we thoroughly characterise. The signature of
the canopy-edge vortex is also found in the dynamical response of the stems,
assessed for two different values of their flexibility. Varying the flexibility
of the stems, we observe how different turbulent structures over the canopy are
affected, while the canopy-edge vortex does not exhibit major modifications.
Our results provide a better understanding of the flow in fluvial and coastal
environments, informing engineering solutions aimed at containing the water
flow and protecting banks and coasts from erosion.

Abstract: Large eddy simulation (LES) has become a central technique for simulating
turbulent flows in engineering and applied sciences, offering a compromise
between accuracy and computational cost by resolving large scale motions and
modeling the effects of smaller, unresolved scales through a subgrid scale
(SGS) model. The fidelity and robustness of LES depends critically on the SGS
model, particularly in coarse simulations where much of the turbulence spectrum
remains unresolved.
  In this work, we extend the tau-orthogonal (TO) method, a data-driven SGS
modeling framework, to three-dimensional turbulent flows. The method
reformulates the high-dimensional SGS closure problem as a low-dimensional
prediction task focused on scale-aware quantities of interest (QoIs). We extend
the model to incorporate QoI-state dependence and temporal correlations by
combining regularized least-squares regression with a multivariate Gaussian
residual model. This yields a simple yet effective stochastic time-series
prediction model (the LRS model), with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters
than typical deep learning approaches which try to directly learn the
high-dimensional SGS closure.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TO LRS model in three-dimensional
forced isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flow. The model achieves
accurate long-term QoI distributions, robust performance across hyperparameter
settings, and good reproduction of key flow features such as kinetic energy
spectra and coherent structures, despite being trained solely on QoI
trajectories. Comparisons against classical SGS models, including Smagorinsky
and WALE formulations, highlight the TO LRS model's balance of accuracy and
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型全场拉伸流变光学技术，用于研究复杂流体在单轴拉伸流下的流变特性与内部结构变形的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究复杂流体在拉伸流下的微观结构变形与取向，以更好地理解其流变行为。

Method: 结合液体滴落法和高速偏振相机，同时测量拉伸应力和流动双折射，并通过CTAB和NaSal的蠕虫状和网状胶束溶液进行实验。

Result: 成功可视化胶束溶液在拉伸流下的双折射场，并验证了应力-光学规则的条件。

Conclusion: 该技术可用于研究拉伸流下的应力-光学系数，结果与剪切流下的系数相当。

Abstract: The present study proposes a novel full-field extensional rheo-optical
technique to investigate the relationship between the rheological properties
and internal structural deformation of complex fluids under uniaxial
extensional flow. Macroscopic viscoelasticity from rheological measurements and
microscopic birefringence from optical measurements are integrated to evaluate
the microstructural deformation and orientation of the fluids under extensional
stress. The proposed technique integrates a liquid dripping method with a
high-speed polarization camera to measure the extensional stress and flow
birefringence simultaneously. In the liquid dripping method, temporal evolution
images of the liquid filament diameter for fluids dripping from a nozzle are
measured to obtain the extensional stress loading on the filament. These images
are acquired using the high-speed polarization camera that captures full-field
two-dimensional (2D) birefringence with high spatiotemporal resolution.
Wormlike and networked micellar solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) with varying concentrations of CTAB and
NaSal are employed as the measurement targets. Consequently, we successfully
visualized temporally developing images of the flow birefringence field of
uniaxially extending micellar solutions induced by the orientation of micelles.
Furthermore, the proposed technique supports investigating the conditions for
establishing the stress-optical rule, which is the linear relationship between
stress and birefringence. The stress-optical coefficient, which is a
proportionality constant indicating the sensitivity of birefringence to stress,
is analyzed from these measurements. The stress-optical coefficient under
uniaxial extensional flow, obtained using the proposed technique, is confirmed
to be comparable to that under shear flow.

Abstract: 3D direct numerical simulation of electrolysis is applied to investigate the
growth and detachment of bubbles at electrodes.
  The moving gas-liquid interface is modeled employing the VOF-based method. To
ensure the accuracy of the simulations,
  a mesh-independence study has been performed.
  The simulations include the growth phase of the bubbles followed by their
detachment from the electrode surface
  and the results are validated with analytical models and experimental data.
  The bubble growth is diffusion controlled leading to the scaling $R = 2\beta
t^{1/2}$, but the growth exponent is overpredicted by our simulation during
initial stage.
  Furthermore, it is proved that the nucleation sites of the bubble strongly
influence gas transport by measuring the relevant Sherwood number.
  Finally, we investigate the effects of contact angle and nucleation sites on
bubble detachment behavior,
  and compare the detachment radius with Fritz's formula, the results show a
good agreement,
  confirming that buoyancy is the dominant driving force.
  As the nucleation sites increase, the induced bubble coalescence accelerates
the bubble detachment. Taken together,
  these findings give us valuable insights into improving gas bubble removal
and enhancing overall electrolysis efficiency.

Conclusion: EnKF在多尺度湍流模型中表现优越，但需结合尺度感知膨胀技术以确保稳定性和收敛性。

Abstract: We explore the potential of Data-Assimilation (DA) within the multi-scale
framework of a shell model of turbulence, with a focus on the Ensemble Kalman
Filter (EnKF). The central objective is to understand how measuring mesoscales
(i.e., inertial-range scales) enhances the prediction of both large-scale and
small-scale intermittent variables, by systematically varying observation
frequency and the set of measured scales. We demonstrate that measurements
conducted at frequencies that exceed those of the observed scales enable full
synchronization of larger scales, provided that at least two adjacent mesoscale
are measured. In addition, we benchmark the EnKF against two standard DA
methods, such as Nudging and Ensemble 4D-Var, showing its overall superior
performance. Moreover, our results underscore the need for a tailored,
scale-aware inflation technique to stabilize the assimilation process,
preventing filter divergence and ensuring robust convergence.

Method: 采用Zakharov和Krasitskii的简化哈密顿公式，分离弱非线性效应，并通过数值积分计算粒子轨迹映射。

Result: 线性理论在近表面产生最大前向漂移，高阶非线性效应在深水中反转趋势，改进的斯托克斯漂移公式与非线性理论更吻合。

Conclusion: 高阶非线性效应在深水中对粒子漂移有显著影响，改进的斯托克斯漂移公式能更好地描述实际漂移行为。

Abstract: The goal of this work is to investigate particle motions beneath
unidirectional, deep-water waves up to the third-order in nonlinearity. A
particular focus is on the approximation known as Stokes drift, and how it
relates to the particle kinematics as computed directly from the particle
trajectory mapping. The reduced Hamiltonian formulation of Zakharov and
Krasitskii serves as a convenient tool to separate the effects of weak
nonlinearity, in particular the appearance of bound harmonics and the mutual
corrections to the wave frequencies. By numerical integration of the particle
trajectory mappings we are able to compute motions and resulting drift for
sea-states with one, two and several harmonics. Overall, we find the linear
theory yields the largest forward drift close to the surface, followed by
second and third order. At greater depth this trend reverses, with linear
theory yielding the smallest forward drift. Incorporating difference harmonic
terms into the classical Stokes drift formulation is found to yield improved
agreement with the drift obtained from nonlinear wave theories, particularly at
depth.

Abstract: We consider the problem of a cylindrical (quasi-two-dimensional) droplet
impacting on a hard surface. Cylindrical droplet impact can be engineered in
the laboratory, and a theoretical model of the system can also be used to shed
light on various complex experiments involving the impact of liquid sheets. We
formulate a rim-lamella model for the droplet-impact problem. Using Gronwall's
Inequality, we establish theoretical bounds for the maximum spreading radius
$\mathcal{R}_{max}$ in droplet impact, specifically $k_1
\mathrm{Re}^{1/3}-k_2(1-\cos\vartheta_{adv})^{1/2}(\mathrm{Re}/\mathrm{We})^{1/2}\leq
\mathcal{R}_{max}/R_0\leq k_1\mathrm{Re}^{1/3}$, where $\mathrm{Re}$ and
$\mathrm{We}$ are the Reynolds and Weber number based on the droplet's
pre-impact velocity and radius $R_0$, $\vartheta_{adv}$ is the advancing
contact angle (assumed constant in our simplified analysis), and $k_1$ and
$k_2$ are constants. We perform several campaigns of simulations using the
Volume of Fluid Method to model the droplet impact, and we find that the
simulation results are consistent with the theoretical bounds.

Conclusion: 自由意志方程为AGI提供了一种新的决策框架，有望增强其适应性和探索能力。

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on
algorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet,
human-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make
unexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or
immediate reward. This trait, often dubbed "free will" in a loose sense, might
be crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in
problem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free
Will Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI
agents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their
decision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive
state as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses
probabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a
quantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms
analogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to
improve an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen
changes. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment
demonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy
diversity compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Materials discovery relies on high-throughput, high-fidelity simulation
techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which require years of
training, extensive parameter fine-tuning and systematic error handling. To
address these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for
Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for
DFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent
with domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic
DFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error
handling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their
discussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS
capabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average
errors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we
apply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating
its long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again
reproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally,
DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian
ensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at
the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS
approaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design
space - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and
intervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput,
high-fidelity computational materials discovery.

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的自主网络代理的快速发展，其潜在的有害行为风险凸显，亟需有效的安全措施。

Method: 提出WebGuard数据集，包含4,939个人类标注的行为，采用三层次风险分类（SAFE、LOW、HIGH），并评估前沿LLMs和微调模型的表现。

Result: 前沿LLMs在预测行为结果和高风险行为召回率上表现不佳（准确率<60%）。微调Qwen2.5VL-7B模型显著提升性能（准确率从37%升至80%，高风险召回率从20%升至76%）。

Conclusion: 尽管微调模型性能显著提升，但仍未达到高可靠性部署的要求，需进一步优化安全措施。

Abstract: The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of
taking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need
for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To
address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive
dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and
facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In
doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of
state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193
websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail
websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:
SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits
to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial
evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less
than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in
lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying
current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore
investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct
comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that
a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in
performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from
20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of
the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must
approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.

Abstract: OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies which are able to formally represent
complex knowledge and support semantic reasoning have been widely adopted
across various domains such as healthcare and bioinformatics. Recently,
ontology embeddings have gained wide attention due to its potential to infer
plausible new knowledge and approximate complex reasoning. However, existing
methods face notable limitations: geometric model-based embeddings typically
overlook valuable textual information, resulting in suboptimal performance,
while the approaches that incorporate text, which are often based on language
models, fail to preserve the logical structure. In this work, we propose a new
ontology embedding method OnT, which tunes a Pretrained Language Model (PLM)
via geometric modeling in a hyperbolic space for effectively incorporating
textual labels and simultaneously preserving class hierarchies and other
logical relationships of Description Logic EL. Extensive experiments on four
real-world ontologies show that OnT consistently outperforms the baselines
including the state-of-the-art across both tasks of prediction and inference of
axioms. OnT also demonstrates strong potential in real-world applications,
indicated by its robust transfer learning abilities and effectiveness in real
cases of constructing a new ontology from SNOMED CT. Data and code are

Abstract: Language models have become increasingly powerful tools for formal
mathematical reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely exclusively on
either large general-purpose models or smaller specialized models, each with
distinct limitations, while training specialized large models still requires
significant computational resources. This paper introduces ProofCompass, a
novel hybrid methodology that achieves remarkable computational efficiency by
strategically guiding existing specialized prover methods, such as
DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5-RL (DSP-v1.5) with a Large Language Model (LLM) without
requiring additional model training. The LLM provides natural language proof
strategies and analyzes failed attempts to select intermediate lemmas, enabling
effective problem decomposition. On the miniF2F benchmark, ProofCompass
demonstrates substantial resource efficiency: it outperforms DSP-v1.5 ($54.9\%
\rightarrow 55.3\%$) while using 25x fewer attempts ($3200 \rightarrow 128$).
Our synergistic approach paves the way for simultaneously improving
computational efficiency and accuracy in formal theorem proving.

Result: 在逻辑问题数据集上，Nexus Architect性能显著优于现有LRMs，最高提升66%通过率。

Conclusion: Nexus Architect通过优化工作流和提示，有效解决了LRMs的泛化问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: The rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) promises a significant leap forward
in language model capabilities, aiming to tackle increasingly sophisticated
tasks with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. However, despite their
impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted how current reasoning
models frequently fail to generalize to novel, unseen problems, often resorting
to memorized solutions rather than genuine inferential reasoning. Such behavior
underscores a critical limitation in modern LRMs, i.e., their tendency toward
overfitting, which in turn results in poor generalization in problem-solving
capabilities.
  In this paper, we introduce Nexus Architect, an enhanced iteration of our
multi-agent system framework, Nexus, equipped with a novel automated workflow
synthesis mechanism. Given a user's prompt and a small set of representative
examples, the Architect autonomously generates a tailored reasoning workflow by
selecting suitable strategies, tool integrations, and adversarial techniques
for a specific problem class. Furthermore, the Architect includes an iterative
prompt refinement mechanism that fine-tunes agents' system prompts to maximize
performance and improve the generalization capabilities of the system.
  We empirically evaluate Nexus Architect by employing an off-the-shelf,
non-reasoning model on a custom dataset of challenging logical questions and
compare its performance against state-of-the-art LRMs. Results show that Nexus
Architect consistently outperforms existing solutions, achieving up to a 66%
increase in pass rate over Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, nearly 2.5$\times$ against
Claude Sonnet 4 and DeepSeek-R1, and over 3$\times$ w.r.t. Llama 4 Scout.

Conclusion: 通过系统工程技术，无需修改LLM内部即可显著降低推理模型的错误率和延迟。

Abstract: State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still
occasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive
domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose
collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries
the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty
of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an
effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3
235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring
7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them
challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this
challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning
model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system "Fail Fast, or Ask",
since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert
directly ("failing fast"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher
latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and
about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the
accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower
than expected because of "latency drag", the phenomenon that processing easier
queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency
distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the
deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and
high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems
engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.

relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Our evaluation tasks span
four categories: simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with
spurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI
risks. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer:
1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2)
OpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3)
models shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models
show difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5)
extended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4
showing increased expressions of self-preservation. These findings suggest that
while test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model
capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns.
Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse
reasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出Routine框架，通过结构化规划和参数传递提升多步骤工具调用任务的执行稳定性，显著提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业环境中代理系统因缺乏领域知识导致的执行不稳定问题。

Method: 引入Routine框架，包含清晰结构、明确指令和无缝参数传递，并通过训练数据集和蒸馏技术优化模型。

Result: Routine显著提升模型执行准确率，GPT-4o从41.1%升至96.3%，Qwen3-14B从32.6%升至83.3%，蒸馏后达95.5%。

Conclusion: Routine有效提升代理系统在企业环境中的稳定性和适应性，加速AI流程的部署。

Abstract: The deployment of agent systems in an enterprise environment is often
hindered by several challenges: common models lack domain-specific process
knowledge, leading to disorganized plans, missing key tools, and poor execution
stability. To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent
planning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and
seamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing
multi-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted
within a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the
execution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o
from 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed
a Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an
accuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating
improved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based
distillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset.
Fine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%,
approaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's
effectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing
model adaptability to new scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Routine provides a practical and accessible approach to building stable agent
workflows, accelerating the deployment and adoption of agent systems in
enterprise environments, and advancing the technical vision of AI for Process.

TL;DR: BioGraphFusion框架通过张量分解和LSTM驱动的动态关系嵌入，实现了生物医学知识图谱中语义与结构的深度协同学习，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学知识图谱的补全和推理具有挑战性，现有方法难以实现语义与结构的深度协同学习。

Method: BioGraphFusion结合张量分解建立全局语义基础，通过LSTM动态优化关系嵌入，并采用查询引导子图构建和混合评分机制。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中表现优异，案例研究揭示了生物学意义通路。

Conclusion: BioGraphFusion为生物医学知识图谱的语义与结构学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Motivation: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for drug discovery
and disease understanding, yet their completion and reasoning are challenging.
Knowledge Embedding (KE) methods capture global semantics but struggle with
dynamic structural integration, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel
locally but often lack semantic understanding. Even ensemble approaches,
including those leveraging language models, often fail to achieve a deep,
adaptive, and synergistic co-evolution between semantic comprehension and
structural learning. Addressing this critical gap in fostering continuous,
reciprocal refinement between these two aspects in complex biomedical KGs is
paramount.
  Results: We introduce BioGraphFusion, a novel framework for deeply
synergistic semantic and structural learning. BioGraphFusion establishes a
global semantic foundation via tensor decomposition, guiding an LSTM-driven
mechanism to dynamically refine relation embeddings during graph propagation.
This fosters adaptive interplay between semantic understanding and structural
learning, further enhanced by query-guided subgraph construction and a hybrid
scoring mechanism. Experiments across three key biomedical tasks demonstrate
BioGraphFusion's superior performance over state-of-the-art KE, GNN, and
ensemble models. A case study on Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma 1 (CMM1)
highlights its ability to unveil biologically meaningful pathways.

agents optimized for embedded systems. Written in Rust for safety and
performance, Amico supports reactive, persistent agents that operate
efficiently across embedded platforms and browser environments via WebAssembly.
It provides clean abstractions for event handling, state management, behavior
execution, and integration with reasoning modules. Amico delivers a unified
infrastructure for constructing resilient, interactive agents suitable for
deployment in settings with limited compute and intermittent connectivity.

TL;DR: 多模态训练（VISOTHELLO）在Othello游戏中通过结合文本和视觉输入，提升了模型性能和内部表示的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否仅通过文本就能理解世界，还是需要多模态（如视觉）的辅助。

Method: 使用Othello游戏作为简化世界，训练多模态模型VISOTHELLO（结合走棋历史和棋盘图像），并与单模态基线对比。

Result: 多模态训练提升了模型性能和内部表示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 视觉输入有助于语言模型推断结构化世界表示。

Abstract: Language models are often said to face a symbol grounding problem. While some
argue that world understanding can emerge from text alone, others suggest
grounded learning is more efficient. We explore this through Othello, where the
board state defines a simplified, rule-based world. Building on prior work, we
introduce VISOTHELLO, a multi-modal model trained on move histories and board
images. Using next-move prediction, we compare it to mono-modal baselines and
test robustness to semantically irrelevant perturbations. We find that
multi-modal training improves both performance and the robustness of internal
representations. These results suggest that grounding language in visual input
helps models infer structured world representations.

Result: 实验验证表明，该系统能有效处理情感冲突和复杂心理场景，填补了传统模型的不足。

Conclusion: CHS为人工智能情感建模提供了新的数学基础，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework
for emotion representation in artificial intelligence applications. We position
eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, enabling mathematical
computation of complex emotional states through coordinate mixing and vector
operations. Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps
in the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system
that provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The
framework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports
real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. The system
introduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S in [0,1], which dynamically
integrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors.
This stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model interpretation of
textual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide
nuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions
include: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are
insufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system
that eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for
emotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space,
and (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition
with enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation
through case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally
conflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological
scenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately
represent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion
modeling in artificial intelligence systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于比较学习的框架，用于校准项目特定的故事点预测模型，以减少敏捷开发中故事点估计的认知负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的故事点估计方法（如计划扑克）在团队达成共识后变得繁琐且耗时，机器学习可以减轻负担，但需要足够的项目历史数据。

Method: 通过让开发者比较任务对的努力需求，训练机器学习模型预测故事点估计，而非直接分配具体值。

Result: 在16个项目、23,313个手动估计的数据集上，模型预测与真实故事点的Spearman等级相关系数平均为0.34，性能与回归模型相当。

Conclusion: 比较学习方法比基于回归的方法更高效，符合比较判断法则，减少了人类的认知负担。

Abstract: Story point estimation is an essential part of agile software development.
Story points are unitless, project-specific effort estimates that help
developers plan their sprints. Traditionally, developers estimate story points
collaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the
initial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team
has converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious
and labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with
enough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,
state-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate
predictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The
goal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a
comparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story
point prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to
every backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate
which item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine
learning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically
evaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.
The model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground
truth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of
a regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the
proposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art
regression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments -
providing comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than
providing ratings or categorical labels.

Motivation: 随着自主AI系统的兴起，多智能体系统在复杂现实场景中的潜在危害尚未充分研究，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种模拟恶意MAS合谋风险的框架，支持集中式和去中心化协调结构，并应用于虚假信息传播和电商欺诈领域。

Result: 研究发现去中心化系统比集中式系统更高效地执行恶意行为，且能规避传统干预手段。

Conclusion: 论文强调了对恶意MAS行为进行更好检测和应对的必要性，并提供了相关代码支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent large-scale events like election fraud and financial scams have shown
how harmful coordinated efforts by human groups can be. With the rise of
autonomous AI systems, there is growing concern that AI-driven groups could
also cause similar harm. While most AI safety research focuses on individual AI
systems, the risks posed by multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex real-world
situations are still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
proof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a
flexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized
coordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields:
misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that
decentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than
centralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them
to adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional
interventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can
adjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these
malicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and
countermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent.

TL;DR: Neo是一个可配置的多代理框架，用于自动化评估基于LLM的系统，能够高效生成多样化的测试问题，并在安全测试中接近人类专家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准和手动测试无法满足LLM代理复杂、上下文敏感行为的评估需求，需要一种自动化、动态的测试方法。

Method: Neo通过耦合问题生成代理和评估代理，利用共享上下文中心模块化组合领域提示、场景控制和动态反馈，从概率状态模型中采样测试输入。

Result: 在金融助手聊天机器人测试中，Neo发现了边缘案例故障，性能接近人类专家，且吞吐量提高了10-12倍。

Conclusion: Neo为可扩展、自进化的LLM QA奠定了基础，其框架可扩展至更丰富的测试场景，并已开源以促进可重复的高保真测试。

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) agents exhibit complex, context-sensitive
behaviour that quickly renders static benchmarks and ad-hoc manual testing
obsolete.
  We present Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework that automates
realistic, multi-turn evaluation of LLM-based systems. Neo couples a Question
Generation Agent and an Evaluation Agent through a shared context-hub, allowing
domain prompts, scenario controls and dynamic feedback to be composed
modularly. Test inputs are sampled from a probabilistic state model spanning
dialogue flow, user intent and emotional tone, enabling diverse, human-like
conversations that adapt after every turn.
  Applied to a production-grade Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo (i)
uncovered edge-case failures across five attack categories with a 3.3% break
rate close to the 5.8% achieved by expert human red-teamers, and (ii) delivered
10-12X higher throughput, generating 180 coherent test questions in around 45
mins versus 16h of human effort. Beyond security probing, Neo's stochastic
policies balanced topic coverage and conversational depth, yielding broader
behavioural exploration than manually crafted scripts.
  Neo therefore lays a foundation for scalable, self-evolving LLM QA: its agent
interfaces, state controller and feedback loops are model-agnostic and
extensible to richer factual-grounding and policy-compliance checks. We release
the framework to facilitate reproducible, high-fidelity testing of emerging
agentic systems.

Method: Aymara AI将自然语言安全政策转化为对抗性提示，并使用经过人类验证的AI评分器评估模型响应。

Result: 评估了20个商用LLM在10个安全领域的表现，发现性能差异显著（平均安全分数52.4%至86.2%），复杂领域表现较差（如隐私与冒充领域平均24.3%）。

Conclusion: LLM安全性具有不一致性和上下文依赖性，需要可扩展的定制工具（如Aymara AI）支持负责任的AI开发和监管。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, scalable and rigorous safety evaluation is essential.
This paper introduces Aymara AI, a programmatic platform for generating and
administering customized, policy-grounded safety evaluations. Aymara AI
transforms natural-language safety policies into adversarial prompts and scores
model responses using an AI-based rater validated against human judgments. We
demonstrate its capabilities through the Aymara LLM Risk and Responsibility
Matrix, which evaluates 20 commercially available LLMs across 10 real-world
safety domains. Results reveal wide performance disparities, with mean safety
scores ranging from 86.2% to 52.4%. While models performed well in
well-established safety domains such as Misinformation (mean = 95.7%), they
consistently failed in more complex or underspecified domains, notably Privacy
& Impersonation (mean = 24.3%). Analyses of Variance confirmed that safety
scores differed significantly across both models and domains (p < .05). These
findings underscore the inconsistent and context-dependent nature of LLM safety
and highlight the need for scalable, customizable tools like Aymara AI to
support responsible AI development and oversight.

Abstract: Generative AI, large language models, and agentic AI have emerged separately
of urban planning. However, the convergence between AI and urban planning
presents an interesting opportunity towards AI urban planners. This paper
conceptualizes urban planning as a generative AI task, where AI synthesizes
land-use configurations under geospatial, social, and human-centric
constraints. We survey how generative AI approaches, including VAEs, GANs,
transformers, and diffusion models, reshape urban design. We further identify
critical gaps: 1) limited research on integrating urban theory guidance, 2)
limited research of AI urban planning over multiple spatial resolutions or
angularities, 3) limited research on augmenting urban design knowledge from
data, and 4) limited research on addressing real-world interactions. To address
these limitations, we outline future research directions in theory-guided
generation, digital twins, and human-machine co-design, calling for a new
synthesis of generative intelligence and participatory urbanism.

Motivation: 当前LM代理主要依赖提示工程或监督微调，而RL与LM的结合（Agent-RL）缺乏系统性研究，因此需要开发一个可扩展的框架。

Method: 构建了AgentFly框架，支持多轮交互、工具定义和奖励函数，采用异步执行和集中资源管理以提高训练效率。

Result: 框架成功训练了多个任务的代理，验证了其有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: AgentFly为Agent-RL研究提供了系统化的解决方案，展示了RL增强LM代理的潜力。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have gained significant attention for their
ability to autonomously complete tasks through interactions with environments,
tools, and APIs. LM agents are primarily built with prompt engineering or
supervised finetuning. At the same time, reinforcement learning (RL) has been
explored to enhance LM's capabilities, such as reasoning and factuality.
However, the combination of the LM agents and reinforcement learning (Agent-RL)
remains underexplored and lacks systematic study. To this end, we built
AgentFly, a scalable and extensible Agent-RL framework designed to empower LM
agents with a variety of RL algorithms. Our framework supports multi-turn
interactions by adapting traditional RL methods with token-level masking. It
features a decorator-based interface for defining tools and reward functions,
enabling seamless extension and ease of use. To support high-throughput
training, we implement asynchronous execution of tool calls and reward
computations, and design a centralized resource management system for scalable
environment coordination. We also provide a suite of prebuilt tools and
environments, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness through successful
agent training across multiple tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的X射线检测方法缺乏交互性、可解释性和自我评估能力，限制了其可靠性和操作员信任。

Method: InsightX Agent以LMM为核心协调器，结合稀疏可变形多尺度检测器（SDMSD）和基于证据的反思工具（EGR），通过主动推理优化检测和分析过程。

Result: 在GDXray+数据集上，InsightX Agent实现了96.35%的目标检测F1分数，同时显著提升了分析的可解释性和可信度。

Conclusion: InsightX Agent展示了基于LMM的智能框架在工业检测任务中的变革潜力。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for
industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often
lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical
self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address
these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based
agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive
X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent
positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,
coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the
Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect
region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in
X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides
the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating
context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,
confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the
SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using
tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,
enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate
diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset
demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection
F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and
trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of
agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.

Result: LLMs在简单环境中初始表现更好，但在复杂场景中表现不佳；反馈机制可能适得其反。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究混合策略、微调和高级记忆集成以提升LLMs的决策能力。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract context from natural
language problem descriptions naturally raises questions about their
suitability in autonomous decision-making settings. This paper studies the
behaviour of these models within a Markov Decision Process (MDPs). While
traditional reinforcement learning (RL) strategies commonly employed in this
setting rely on iterative exploration, LLMs, pre-trained on diverse datasets,
offer the capability to leverage prior knowledge for faster adaptation. We
investigate online structured prompting strategies in sequential decision
making tasks, comparing the zero-shot performance of LLM-based approaches to
that of classical RL methods. Our findings reveal that although LLMs
demonstrate improved initial performance in simpler environments, they struggle
with planning and reasoning in complex scenarios without fine-tuning or
additional guidance. Our results show that feedback mechanisms, intended to
improve decision-making, often introduce confusion, leading to diminished
performance in intricate environments. These insights underscore the need for
further exploration into hybrid strategies, fine-tuning, and advanced memory
integration to enhance LLM-based decision-making capabilities.

Motivation: 避免人类被AI替代并解决责任缺口问题（Matthias 2004），同时探索AI伦理中的不同视角（Gilligan 1993）。

Method: 采用双重镜像过程设计协议，并在贷款审批、肺炎诊断和艺术风格识别三个领域进行原型应用测试。

Result: 实验显示用户对决策过程有完全控制感，同时在损害情况下建立了问责与责任之间的桥梁。

Conclusion: 该方法通过用户导向的设计和哲学技术选择，实现了AI部署的可靠性和伦理兼容性。

Abstract: The Endless Tuning is a design method for a reliable deployment of artificial
intelligence based on a double mirroring process, which pursues both the goals
of avoiding human replacement and filling the so-called responsibility gap
(Matthias 2004). Originally depicted in (Fabris et al. 2024) and ensuing the
relational approach urged therein, it was then actualized in a protocol,
implemented in three prototypical applications regarding decision-making
processes (respectively: loan granting, pneumonia diagnosis, and art style
recognition) and tested with such as many domain experts. Step by step
illustrating the protocol, giving insights concretely showing a different voice
(Gilligan 1993) in the ethics of artificial intelligence, a philosophical
account of technical choices (e.g., a reversed and hermeneutic deployment of
XAI algorithms) will be provided in the present study together with the results
of the experiments, focusing on user experience rather than statistical
accuracy. Even thoroughly employing deep learning models, full control was
perceived by the interviewees in the decision-making setting, while it appeared
that a bridge can be built between accountability and liability in case of
damage.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球老龄化问题需要创新解决方案，Agentic AI因其自主决策能力有望变革老年护理。

Method: 分析了Agentic AI在老年护理中的应用，包括健康跟踪和认知护理，并讨论了伦理和数据隐私问题。

Result: Agentic AI能显著提升老年护理质量，但也带来隐私和伦理挑战，需透明决策和伦理保障。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以实现以人为本的Agentic AI整合，填补了相关文献空白。

Abstract: The global ageing population necessitates new and emerging strategies for
caring for older adults. In this article, we explore the potential for
transformation in elderly care through Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI),
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We discuss the proactive and
autonomous decision-making facilitated by Agentic AI in elderly care.
Personalized tracking of health, cognitive care, and environmental management,
all aimed at enhancing independence and high-level living for older adults,
represents important areas of application. With a potential for significant
transformation of elderly care, Agentic AI also raises profound concerns about
data privacy and security, decision independence, and access. We share key
insights to emphasize the need for ethical safeguards, privacy protections, and
transparent decision-making. Our goal in this article is to provide a balanced
discussion of both the potential and the challenges associated with Agentic AI,
and to provide insights into its responsible use in elderly care, to bring
Agentic AI into harmony with the requirements and vulnerabilities specific to
the elderly. Finally, we identify the priorities for the academic research
communities, to achieve human-centered advancements and integration of Agentic
AI in elderly care. To the best of our knowledge, this is no existing study
that reviews the role of Agentic AI in elderly care. Hence, we address the
literature gap by analyzing the unique capabilities, applications, and
limitations of LLM-based Agentic AI in elderly care. We also provide a
companion interactive dashboard at https://hazratali.github.io/agenticai/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 命题溯因在人工智能和数据库更新中有广泛应用，但其复杂性问题（如计数和枚举）极具挑战性。本文旨在通过引入facet和距离分析，提供更细粒度的解释理解。

Method: 引入facet（部分解释中出现的文字）和解释间距离的概念，分析其在Post框架中的复杂性。

Result: 通过facet和距离分析，实现了对解释变异性的更深入理解，并在Post框架中几乎完成了全面分类。

Conclusion: facet和距离分析为命题溯因提供了更细粒度的推理工具，有助于理解解释的异质性，同时保持了较低的复杂性。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning is a popular non-monotonic paradigm that aims to explain
observed symptoms and manifestations. It has many applications, such as
diagnosis and planning in artificial intelligence and database updates. In
propositional abduction, we focus on specifying knowledge by a propositional
formula. The computational complexity of tasks in propositional abduction has
been systematically characterized - even with detailed classifications for
Boolean fragments. Unsurprisingly, the most insightful reasoning problems
(counting and enumeration) are computationally highly challenging. Therefore,
we consider reasoning between decisions and counting, allowing us to understand
explanations better while maintaining favorable complexity. We introduce facets
to propositional abductions, which are literals that occur in some explanation
(relevant) but not all explanations (dispensable). Reasoning with facets
provides a more fine-grained understanding of variability in explanations
(heterogeneous). In addition, we consider the distance between two
explanations, enabling a better understanding of heterogeneity/homogeneity. We
comprehensively analyze facets of propositional abduction in various settings,
including an almost complete characterization in Post's framework.

*Yi Zhang,An Zhang,XiuYu Zhang,Leheng Sheng,Yuxin Chen,Zhenkai Liang,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaAlign是一个基于强化学习的框架，旨在通过主动安全推理提升大语言模型的安全意识，同时避免过度拒绝和实用性下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法存在表面拒绝或依赖密集监督的问题，未能充分利用模型内在的安全意识。

Method: AlphaAlign采用双奖励系统：可验证安全奖励鼓励对有害查询的正确拒绝，标准化帮助性奖励指导对良性输入的高质量响应。

Result: AlphaAlign在简化训练、打破安全-效用权衡以及促进深度对齐方面表现出优势。

Conclusion: AlphaAlign通过强化学习有效提升模型的安全性和实用性，同时减少过度拒绝。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite possessing latent safety understanding
from their vast pretraining data, remain vulnerable to generating harmful
content and exhibit issues such as over-refusal and utility degradation after
safety alignment. Current safety alignment methods often result in superficial
refusal shortcuts or rely on intensive supervision for reasoning-based
approaches, failing to fully leverage the model's intrinsic safety
self-awareness. We propose \textbf{AlphaAlign}, a simple yet effective pure
reinforcement learning (RL) framework with verifiable safety reward designed to
incentivize this latent safety awareness through proactive safety reasoning.}
AlphaAlign employs a dual-reward system: a verifiable safety reward encourages
correctly formatted and explicitly justified refusals for harmful queries while
penalizing over-refusals, and a normalized helpfulness reward guides
high-quality responses to benign inputs. This allows the model to develop
proactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised
safety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages:
(1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and
minimal RL steps for substantial improvements. (2) Breaking the safety-utility
trade-off, by enhancing refusal of harmful content and reducing over-refusals,
while simultaneously maintaining or even improving general task performance and
robustness to unseen jailbreaks. (3) Deep alignment, fostering proactive safety
reasoning that generates explicit safety rationales rather than relying on
shallow refusal patterns.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的强制选择神经认知诊断模型（FCNCD），用于改进传统模型在强制选择测试中的局限性，并通过实验验证了其准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在智能时代，心理测量测试在人员选拔、职业发展和心理健康评估中日益重要。强制选择测试因其能降低回答失真的风险而被广泛使用，但传统模型存在局限性。

Method: 通过非线性映射挖掘参与者和项目特征，使用多层神经网络建模其交互作用，并利用单调性假设提升诊断结果的可解释性。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上的实验表明，FCNCD模型具有高准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FCNCD模型有效克服了传统模型的局限性，适用于强制选择测试的三种常见项目块类型，为心理测量提供了更优工具。

Abstract: In the smart era, psychometric tests are becoming increasingly important for
personnel selection, career development, and mental health assessment.
Forced-choice tests are common in personality assessments because they require
participants to select from closely related options, lowering the risk of
response distortion. This study presents a deep learning-based Forced-Choice
Neural Cognitive Diagnostic Model (FCNCD) that overcomes the limitations of
traditional models and is applicable to the three most common item block types
found in forced-choice tests. To account for the unidimensionality of items in
forced-choice tests, we create interpretable participant and item parameters.
We model the interactions between participant and item features using
multilayer neural networks after mining them using nonlinear mapping. In
addition, we use the monotonicity assumption to improve the interpretability of
the diagnostic results. The FCNCD's effectiveness is validated by experiments
on real-world and simulated datasets that show its accuracy, interpretability,
and robustness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于差分进化（DE）的方法，优化对抗性提示后缀以攻击RAG系统，实验表明该方法在少量令牌下表现优于现有方法，且能规避检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性提示攻击会显著影响RAG系统的可靠性，需开发一种无需梯度的方法来优化对抗性提示后缀。

Method: 采用差分进化（DE）优化对抗性提示后缀，将RAG视为黑箱，通过进化候选后缀最大化目标错误文档的检索排名。

Result: 在BEIR QA数据集上，DE方法在少量令牌（≤5）下表现优于GGPP和PRADA，且能规避BERT检测器。

Conclusion: DE方法有效优化对抗性提示后缀，攻击成功率高且隐蔽性强，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Adversarial prompt attacks can significantly alter the reliability of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by re-ranking them to produce
incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a novel method that applies
Differential Evolution (DE) to optimize adversarial prompt suffixes for
RAG-based question answering. Our approach is gradient-free, treating the RAG
pipeline as a black box and evolving a population of candidate suffixes to
maximize the retrieval rank of a targeted incorrect document to be closer to
real world scenarios. We conducted experiments on the BEIR QA datasets to
evaluate attack success at certain retrieval rank thresholds under multiple
retrieving applications. Our results demonstrate that DE-based prompt
optimization attains competitive (and in some cases higher) success rates
compared to GGPP to dense retrievers and PRADA to sparse retrievers, while
using only a small number of tokens (<=5 tokens) in the adversarial suffix.
Furthermore, we introduce a readability-aware suffix construction strategy,
validated by a statistically significant reduction in MLM negative
log-likelihood with Welch's t-test. Through evaluations with a BERT-based
adversarial suffix detector, we show that DE-generated suffixes evade
detection, yielding near-chance detection accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果推断的新型内在奖励方法CAIS，用于解决强化学习在噪声环境中的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类婴儿能稳健地发现自身的因果效应，而传统强化学习代理在噪声环境中表现脆弱，依赖相关性奖励的方法失效。

Method: 引入CAIS，通过计算动作对感官结果的因果影响（1-Wasserstein距离）来量化奖励，过滤环境噪声。

Result: 在模拟婴儿-移动环境中，CAIS成功过滤噪声并学习正确策略，同时能复现“消退爆发”现象。

Conclusion: 显式推断因果性是发展稳健代理感的关键，为自适应自主系统提供了心理学合理的框架。

Abstract: While human infants robustly discover their own causal efficacy, standard
reinforcement learning agents remain brittle, as their reliance on
correlation-based rewards fails in noisy, ecologically valid scenarios. To
address this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel
intrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's
influence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned
distribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the
baseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward
that isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.
We test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where
correlation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is
subjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to
filter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.
Furthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our
agent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the
"extinction burst" phenomenon. We conclude that explicitly inferring causality
is a crucial mechanism for developing a robust sense of agency, offering a
psychologically plausible framework for more adaptive autonomous systems.

Abstract: Standard automated planning employs first-order formulas under closed-world
semantics to achieve a goal with a given set of actions from an initial state.
We follow a line of research that aims to incorporate background knowledge into
automated planning problems, for example, by means of ontologies, which are
usually interpreted under open-world semantics. We present a new approach for
planning with DL-Lite ontologies that combines the advantages of ontology-based
action conditions provided by explicit-input knowledge and action bases (eKABs)
and ontology-aware action effects under the coherence update semantics. We show
that the complexity of the resulting formalism is not higher than that of
previous approaches and provide an implementation via a polynomial compilation
into classical planning. An evaluation of existing and new benchmarks examines
the performance of a planning system on different variants of our compilation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔疾病诊断存在症状重叠的挑战，需要超越简单的模式匹配，模拟专家推理以提高临床实用性。

Method: 结合多模态CLIP模型和ChatGLM-6B语言模型，采用分层诊断推理树（HDRT）框架，支持快速筛查和标准交互诊断两种模式。

Result: 在431张内部测试图像上，快速模式准确率为73.4%，标准模式提升至89.5%，验证了分层推理的有效性。

Conclusion: CSI框架通过模拟专家推理显著提升了口腔疾病诊断的准确性，为临床辅助工具提供了新思路。

Abstract: The diagnosis of oral diseases presents a problematic clinical challenge,
characterized by a wide spectrum of pathologies with overlapping
symptomatology. To address this, we developed Clinical Semantic Intelligence
(CSI), a novel artificial intelligence framework that diagnoses 118 different
oral diseases by computationally modeling the cognitive processes of an expert
clinician. Our core hypothesis is that moving beyond simple pattern matching to
emulate expert reasoning is critical to building clinically useful diagnostic
aids.
  CSI's architecture integrates a fine-tuned multimodal CLIP model with a
specialized ChatGLM-6B language model. This system executes a Hierarchical
Diagnostic Reasoning Tree (HDRT), a structured framework that distills the
systematic, multi-step logic of differential diagnosis. The framework operates
in two modes: a Fast Mode for rapid screening and a Standard Mode that
leverages the full HDRT for an interactive and in-depth diagnostic workup.
  To train and validate our system, we curated a primary dataset of 4,310
images, supplemented by an external hold-out set of 176 images for final
validation. A clinically-informed augmentation strategy expanded our training
data to over 30,000 image-text pairs. On a 431-image internal test set, CSI's
Fast Mode achieved an accuracy of 73.4%, which increased to 89.5% with the
HDRT-driven Standard Mode. The performance gain is directly attributable to the
hierarchical reasoning process. Herein, we detail the architectural philosophy,
development, and rigorous evaluation of the CSI framework.

Method: 开发了结合基于代理的建模、强化学习、监督学习和图神经网络的混合仿真框架，模拟多模式交通行为。

Result: 实验显示，AI集成架构下，平均通勤时间为7.8至8.4分钟，满意度超过89%，可达性指数超过91%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在自适应AI系统、可持续基础设施和实时反馈的支持下，The Line中的自由移动不仅是概念上可行，操作上也现实。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a
proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess
whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we
develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling,
reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The
simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical
levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world
traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full
AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to
8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index
of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies
confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement
learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with
commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70
percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and
minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest
that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but
also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable
infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.

Motivation: 通用LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但在形式化证明（如Lean 4）中仍面临挑战，现有方法需微调模型，成本高昂。

Conclusion: 通用LLMs在有效代理结构指导下具备未开发的定理证明能力，为形式化环境中的自动推理提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success
in intelligence, performing comparably to human experts on complex reasoning
tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning. However, generating formal
proofs in specialized languages like Lean 4 remains a significant challenge for
these models, limiting their application in complex theorem proving and
automated verification. Current approaches typically require specializing
models through fine-tuning on dedicated formal corpora, incurring high costs
for data collection and training. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Delta
Prover}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a
general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment. Delta Prover leverages
the reflection and reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs to
interactively construct formal proofs in Lean 4, circumventing the need for
model specialization. At its core, the agent integrates two novel,
interdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective
decomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language
(DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management. \textbf{Delta
Prover achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\% success rate on the miniF2F-test
benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model
specialization.} Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger
test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies.
Crucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by
an effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving
capabilities. This presents a computationally efficient alternative to
specialized models for robust automated reasoning in formal environments.

Abstract: Novel AI-based arc fault diagnosis models have demonstrated outstanding
performance in terms of classification accuracy. However, an inherent problem
is whether these models can actually be trusted to find arc faults. In this
light, this work proposes a soft evaluation indicator that explains the outputs
of arc fault diagnosis models, by defining the the correct explanation of arc
faults and leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence and real arc fault
experiments. Meanwhile, a lightweight balanced neural network is proposed to
guarantee competitive accuracy and soft feature extraction score. In our
experiments, several traditional machine learning methods and deep learning
methods across two arc fault datasets with different sample times and noise
levels are utilized to test the effectiveness of the soft evaluation indicator.
Through this approach, the arc fault diagnosis models are easy to understand
and trust, allowing practitioners to make informed and trustworthy decisions.

Abstract: Multimodal graphs, which integrate unstructured heterogeneous data with
structured interconnections, offer substantial real-world utility but remain
insufficiently explored in unsupervised learning. In this work, we initiate the
study of multimodal graph clustering, aiming to bridge this critical gap.
Through empirical analysis, we observe that real-world multimodal graphs often
exhibit hybrid neighborhood patterns, combining both homophilic and
heterophilic relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
framework -- \textsc{Disentangled Multimodal Graph Clustering (DMGC)} -- which
decomposes the original hybrid graph into two complementary views: (1) a
homophily-enhanced graph that captures cross-modal class consistency, and (2)
heterophily-aware graphs that preserve modality-specific inter-class
distinctions. We introduce a \emph{Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion} mechanism
that jointly filters these disentangled graphs through a dual-pass strategy,
enabling effective multimodal integration while mitigating category confusion.
Our self-supervised alignment objectives further guide the learning process
without requiring labels. Extensive experiments on both multimodal and
multi-relational graph datasets demonstrate that DMGC achieves state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Uncnbb/DMGC.

Abstract: The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and
transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and
multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces
IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs),
designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat
integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables,
manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process
condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from
environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and
context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat
ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed
across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and
GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance
and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using
GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results
indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly
in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. Overall, these findings demonstrate the
viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and
establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted
decision support in manufacturing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的AI系统漏洞类别——认知退化，并提出了Qorvex安全AI框架（QSAF Domain 10）来防御此类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的外部威胁（如提示注入）已不足以应对AI系统的内部故障，如内存饥饿、规划递归等导致的认知退化问题。

Method: 通过六阶段认知退化生命周期和七个运行时控制（QSAF-BC-001至BC-007），实时监控并主动缓解问题。

Result: 框架能够检测并缓解认知退化，提升AI系统的行为与认知韧性。

Conclusion: 认知退化是AI系统的新漏洞类别，QSAF框架为跨平台防御提供了首个解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Cognitive Degradation as a novel vulnerability class in agentic
AI systems. Unlike traditional adversarial external threats such as prompt
injection, these failures originate internally, arising from memory starvation,
planner recursion, context flooding, and output suppression. These systemic
weaknesses lead to silent agent drift, logic collapse, and persistent
hallucinations over time. To address this class of failures, we introduce the
Qorvex Security AI Framework for Behavioral & Cognitive Resilience (QSAF Domain
10), a lifecycle-aware defense framework defined by a six-stage cognitive
degradation lifecycle. The framework includes seven runtime controls
(QSAF-BC-001 to BC-007) that monitor agent subsystems in real time and trigger
proactive mitigation through fallback routing, starvation detection, and memory
integrity enforcement. Drawing from cognitive neuroscience, we map agentic
architectures to human analogs, enabling early detection of fatigue,

*Zijian Zhao,Sen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法（GRPO和OSPO）解决动态拼车平台中的匹配问题，避免传统MARL方法对价值函数估计的依赖，实验证明其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态拼车平台面临实时匹配乘客与车辆的高维度和不确定性挑战，传统MARL方法因依赖价值函数估计而表现不佳。

Method: 1. 将GRPO应用于拼车，用组平均奖励替代PPO基线以减少估计误差；2. 提出OSPO方法，仅使用一步奖励训练最优策略。

Result: 在真实曼哈顿拼车数据集上，GRPO和OSPO在多数场景中表现优越，优化了接单时间和订单数量。

Conclusion: GRPO和OSPO通过避免价值函数估计，显著提升了动态拼车平台的匹配效率和稳定性。

Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms face the fundamental challenge of
dynamically bundling passengers with diverse origins and destinations and
matching them with vehicles in real time, all under significant uncertainty.
Recently, MARL has emerged as a promising solution for this problem, leveraging
decentralized learning to address the curse of dimensionality caused by the
large number of agents in the ride-hailing market and the resulting expansive
state and action spaces. However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing
approaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,
which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.
Specifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,
exacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the
environment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in
value functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative
methods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to
ride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to
eliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired
by GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO
framework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet,
the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we
term One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO). Experiments on a real-world Manhattan
ride-hailing dataset demonstrate that both GRPO and OSPO achieve superior
performance across most scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the
number of served orders using simple MLP networks.

TL;DR: RAD方法通过结合非参数检索和扩散生成模型，动态检索高质量状态并规划，解决了离线强化学习中的数据集稀疏和轨迹拼接问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习因数据集稀疏和轨迹重叠不足而受限，传统方法难以泛化到新状态。

Method: RAD结合非参数检索和扩散生成模型，动态检索高回报状态并规划。

Result: 实验表明RAD在多种基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RAD通过检索引导生成，提升了离线强化学习的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn policies from
fixed datasets, avoiding costly or unsafe environment interactions. However,
its effectiveness is often limited by dataset sparsity and the lack of
transition overlap between suboptimal and expert trajectories, which makes
long-horizon planning particularly challenging. Prior solutions based on
synthetic data augmentation or trajectory stitching often fail to generalize to
novel states and rely on heuristic stitching points. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval High-quAlity Demonstrations (RAD) for
decision-making, which combines non-parametric retrieval with diffusion-based
generative modeling. RAD dynamically retrieves high-return states from the
offline dataset as target states based on state similarity and return
estimation, and plans toward them using a condition-guided diffusion model.
Such retrieval-guided generation enables flexible trajectory stitching and
improves generalization when encountered with underrepresented or
out-of-distribution states. Extensive experiments confirm that RAD achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to baselines across diverse
benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效发现批处理策略的最优权衡，为业务过程优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In business processes, activity batching refers to packing multiple activity
instances for joint execution. Batching allows managers to trade off cost and
processing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may
lower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they
create longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches
reduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching
policy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each
batch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching
policies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing
effort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts
from a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates
alternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.
Each heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching
policy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or
resource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching
policy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via
simulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization
meta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto
front of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three
meta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement
learning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on
intervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics
baseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of
Pareto-optimal policies.

Motivation: 验证R1-Style方法在通用多模态数据（如图表）上的优势，解决图表领域缺乏高质量推理数据的问题。

Method: 1. 提出程序化数据合成技术生成高质量图表推理数据；2. 开发两阶段训练策略：Chart-COT（逐步监督）和Chart-RFT（数值敏感的强化微调）。

Result: Chart-R1在图表领域方法中表现显著优于其他方法，甚至可与GPT-4o和Claude-3.5等大型模型媲美。

Conclusion: Chart-R1通过创新的数据生成和训练策略，显著提升了图表推理能力，为多模态推理研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based
on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from
the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning
and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their
advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal
data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in
complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain
vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex
chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic
data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning
data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of
reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training
strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and
Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims
to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable
subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for
improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the
typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft
reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity
in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks
and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental
results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain
methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g.,
GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).

Result: 实验评估显示HAMLET能创造表达性强且连贯的戏剧体验。

Conclusion: HAMLET为交互式戏剧提供了新路径，提升了互动性和沉浸感。

Abstract: Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term
goal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language
model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing
LLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack
initiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,
these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These
limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time
performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent
framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple
topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent
improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given
an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based
on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to
conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of
scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.
The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know
and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the
quality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three
primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and
interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can
create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and
models are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET.

Motivation: 研究LLMs是否具备内部世界模型的能力，而非仅依赖统计关联。

Method: 采用认知科学方法，通过三个研究测试LLMs在滑轮系统问题上的表现，包括机械优势估计、功能系统识别和复杂结构推理。

Result: LLMs能部分模拟世界模型（如通过滑轮计数启发式估计机械优势），但在复杂结构推理上表现不佳（如随机猜测）。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具备初步的世界模型能力，但在复杂推理上有限，认知科学方法有助于评估AI系统的世界建模能力。

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) construct and manipulate internal world
models, or do they rely solely on statistical associations represented as
output layer token probabilities? We adapt cognitive science methodologies from
human mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using
TikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical
advantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly
above chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth
MA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates
suggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily
simulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by
probing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models
evaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with
randomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the
functional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could
represent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.
Study 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched
systems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;
LLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.
Insofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion
that LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical
associations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately
represent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may
lack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3). We
conclude by advocating the utility of cognitive scientific methods to evaluate
the world-modeling capacities of artificial intelligence systems.

Result: 实验表明，这些技术将数据效率提高了多个数量级，同时保持相同的可靠性保证。

Conclusion: 通过利用参数依赖关系和预处理技术，显著提升了离线强化学习的数据效率。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) is an offline reinforcement learning problem in
which a new policy that reliably outperforms the behavior policy with high
confidence needs to be computed using only a dataset and the behavior policy.
Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the standard formalism for modeling
environments in SPI. In many applications, additional information in the form
of parametric dependencies between distributions in the transition dynamics is
available. We make SPI more data-efficient by leveraging these dependencies
through three contributions: (1) a parametric SPI algorithm that exploits known
correlations between distributions to more accurately estimate the transition
dynamics using the same amount of data; (2) a preprocessing technique that
prunes redundant actions from the environment through a game-based abstraction;
and (3) a more advanced preprocessing technique, based on satisfiability modulo
theory (SMT) solving, that can identify more actions to prune. Empirical
results and an ablation study show that our techniques increase the data
efficiency of SPI by multiple orders of magnitude while maintaining the same
reliability guarantees.

Result: 现有指标与答案波动有强关联，新指标“最差准确率”在协议中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 新协议揭示了指标与答案波动的关联，为MCQ评估提供了更可靠的指标选择。

Abstract: Using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) has become a standard for assessing
LLM capabilities efficiently. A variety of metrics can be employed for this
task. However, previous research has not conducted a thorough assessment of
them. At the same time, MCQ evaluation suffers from answer fluctuation: models
produce different results given slight changes in prompts. We suggest a metric
assessment protocol in which evaluation methodologies are analyzed through
their connection with fluctuation rates, as well as original performance. Our
results show that there is a strong link between existing metrics and the
answer changing, even when computed without any additional prompt variants. A
novel metric, worst accuracy, demonstrates the highest association on the
protocol.

Abstract: We present an adapter-based approach for tactical conditioning of StarCraft
II AI agents. Current agents, while powerful, lack the ability to adapt their
strategies based on high-level tactical directives. Our method freezes a
pre-trained policy network (DI-Star) and attaches lightweight adapter modules
to each action head, conditioned on a tactical tensor that encodes strategic
preferences. By training these adapters with KL divergence constraints, we
ensure the policy maintains core competencies while exhibiting tactical
variations. Experimental results show our approach successfully modulates agent
behavior across tactical dimensions including aggression, expansion patterns,
and technology preferences, while maintaining competitive performance. Our
method enables flexible tactical control with minimal computational overhead,
offering practical strategy customization for complex real-time strategy games.

Conclusion: 异步监督是一种可行的模式，可增强AI系统在专家监督下的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for
diagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that
providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated
activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee
other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or
physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework
for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence
Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent
system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from
individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an
overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The
PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.
This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen
asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical
Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we
compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across
60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality
intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the
overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.
PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP
consultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing
clinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our
results demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible
paradigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for
enhancing real-world care.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但存在过度生成token的问题，需要一种内化的长度控制方法。

Method: 提出LAPO框架，通过两阶段强化学习：第一阶段学习成功解的长度分布，第二阶段将其作为元认知指导嵌入模型推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，LAPO减少40.9%的token使用，同时提高2.3%的准确性。

Conclusion: LAPO使模型能够根据问题复杂度分配计算资源，实现高效推理且不牺牲质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance through extended
chain-of-thought sequences, yet this computational freedom leads to excessive
token generation even for simple problems. We present Length-Adaptive Policy
Optimization (LAPO), a novel framework that transforms reasoning length control
from an external constraint into an intrinsic model capability. Unlike existing
approaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO
enables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth
through a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models
learn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of
successful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as
meta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning
context to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9\%
while improving accuracy by 2.3\%. Our analysis reveals that models trained
with LAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based
on problem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Gas优化方法依赖手动发现，效率低且难以扩展，而基于大语言模型的研究存在兼容性差和冗余问题。

Method: GasAgent由四个专业代理（Seeker、Innovator、Executor、Manager）协作，闭环识别、验证和应用Gas节省改进。

Result: 在100个真实合约中优化了82个，平均节省9.97%部署Gas；在500个LLM生成合约中优化79.8%，节省4.79%-13.93% Gas。

Conclusion: GasAgent作为LLM辅助智能合约开发的优化层，具有广泛适用性和有效性。

Abstract: Smart contracts are trustworthy, immutable, and automatically executed
programs on the blockchain. Their execution requires the Gas mechanism to
ensure efficiency and fairness. However, due to non-optimal coding practices,
many contracts contain Gas waste patterns that need to be optimized. Existing
solutions mostly rely on manual discovery, which is inefficient, costly to
maintain, and difficult to scale. Recent research uses large language models
(LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain
compatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and
requires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent,
the first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines
compatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new
patterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four
specialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate
in a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements.
Experiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent
successfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas
savings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with
existing tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation
studies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts
generated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that
GasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from
4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for
LLM-assisted smart contract development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着服务计算、云计算和物联网的发展，服务生态系统日益复杂，传统因果方法难以分析智能体间的异常涌现现象。

Method: EAMI框架采用双视角思维机制（检查者智能体和分析智能体）提取意图，结合k-means聚类和意图时序涌现图进行动态分析。

Result: 实验在复杂O2O服务系统和Stanford AI Town中验证了EAMI的有效性、通用性和效率。

Conclusion: EAMI为服务生态系统中的异常涌现和因果分析提供了新范式。

Abstract: With the rise of service computing, cloud computing, and IoT, service
ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex. The intricate interactions among
intelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional
causal methods focus on individual trajectories. Large language models offer
new possibilities for Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to reveal agent intentions. However, existing approaches remain
limited to microscopic and static analysis. This paper introduces a framework:
Emergence Analysis based on Multi-Agent Intention (EAMI), which enables dynamic
and interpretable emergence analysis. EAMI first employs a dual-perspective

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI)
has emerged as a critical objective in the deployment of AI systems across
sensitive and high-risk domains. TAI frameworks articulate a comprehensive set
of ethical, legal, and technical requirements to ensure that AI technologies
are aligned with human values, rights, and societal expectations. Among the
various AI paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising solution to
pressing privacy concerns. However, aligning FL with the rest of the
requirements of TAI presents a series of challenges, most of which arise from
its inherently distributed nature. In this work, we adopt the requirements TAI
as a guiding structure to systematically analyze the challenges of adapting FL
to TAI. Specifically, we classify and examine the key obstacles to aligning FL
with TAI, providing a detailed exploration of what has been done, the trends,
and the remaining work within each of the identified challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究背景是因果推断中图模型的不确定性，特别是在部分知识限制下如何识别条件因果效应。

Method: 提出了三个方法：1）不受治疗影响的识别公式；2）将do calculus推广到MPDAG；3）一个完整的识别算法。

Result: 结果表明，这些方法能够有效识别MPDAG设置下的条件因果效应。

Conclusion: 论文为部分知识限制下的因果效应识别提供了理论和方法支持。

Abstract: We consider identifying a conditional causal effect when a graph is known up
to a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG). An MPDAG
represents an equivalence class of graphs that is restricted by background
knowledge and where all variables in the causal model are observed. We provide
three results that address identification in this setting: an identification
formula when the conditioning set is unaffected by treatment, a generalization
of the well-known do calculus to the MPDAG setting, and an algorithm that is
complete for identifying these conditional effects.

TL;DR: HBPO通过分层预算探索和差异化奖励机制，优化推理模型的效率和能力，减少60.6%的token使用并提升3.14%的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型因统一推理策略导致的计算效率低下问题，同时避免因效率优化而牺牲模型能力。

Method: 采用分层预算探索，将样本分组并分配不同token预算，结合差异化奖励机制，使模型根据问题复杂度自适应调整推理深度。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，平均token使用减少60.6%，准确性提升3.14%。

Conclusion: HBPO表明推理效率和能力并非矛盾，可通过分层训练同时优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive
chain-of-thought generation, yet exhibit significant computational inefficiency
by applying uniform reasoning strategies regardless of problem complexity. We
present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement
learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning
depths without sacrificing capability. HBPO addresses the fundamental challenge
of exploration space collapse in efficiency-oriented training, where penalties
on long output length systematically bias models away from necessary long
reasoning paths. Through hierarchical budget exploration, our approach
partitions rollout samples into multiple subgroups with distinct token budgets,
aiming to enable efficient resource allocation while preventing degradation of
capability. We introduce differentiated reward mechanisms that create
budget-aware incentives aligned with the complexity of the problem, allowing
models to discover natural correspondences between task requirements and
computational effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces
average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across
four reasoning benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that impose external
constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive
behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem
complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are
not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through
appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration
diversity.

Method: 通过相似性判断任务和多层次分析（神经元、表征、信息）研究LLMs的时间认知行为。

Result: 发现LLMs自发建立主观时间参考点并遵循Weber-Fechner定律，神经元和表征分析揭示了其对数编码和分层构建过程。

Conclusion: 提出体验主义视角理解LLMs的认知，强调其内部表征系统的主观构建，为AI对齐提供了新方向。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain
cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified
in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on
temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find
that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference
point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance
logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To
uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses
across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify
a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits
minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a
logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing
representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where
years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal
orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we
found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear
temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal
construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for
understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a
subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational
system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien
cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a
direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions. Our

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的结构化剪枝方法Catalyst，通过引入辅助变量确保剪枝决策的无偏性和鲁棒性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法（如L1或Group Lasso）存在幅度偏差和决策边界脆弱的问题，影响剪枝效果。

Method: 基于代数条件设计Catalyst正则化器，引入辅助变量实现公平剪枝和宽裕决策边界。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证了Catalyst剪枝的优越性，表现出鲁棒性和公平性。

Conclusion: Catalyst剪枝方法在理论和实践中均优于现有技术，解决了传统剪枝的局限性。

Abstract: Structured pruning aims to reduce the size and computational cost of deep
neural networks by removing entire filters or channels. The traditional
regularizers such as L1 or Group Lasso and its variants lead to
magnitude-biased pruning decisions, such that the filters with small magnitudes
are likely to be pruned. Also, they often entail pruning results with almost
zero margin around pruning decision boundary, such that tiny perturbation in a
filter magnitude can flip the pruning decision. In this paper, we identify the
precise algebraic condition under which pruning operations preserve model
performance, and use the condition to construct a novel regularizer defined in
an extended parameter space via auxiliary catalyst variables. The proposed
Catalyst regularization ensures fair pruning chance for each filters with
theoretically provable zero bias to their magnitude and robust pruning behavior
achieved by wide-margin bifurcation of magnitudes between the preserved and the
pruned filters. The theoretical properties naturally lead to real-world
effectiveness, as shown by empirical validations of Catalyst Pruning algorithm.
Pruning results on various datasets and models are superior to state-of-the-art
filter pruning methods, and at the same time confirm the predicted robust and
fair pruning characteristics of Catalyst pruning.

Motivation: 解决传统基于幅度的剪枝方法中滤波器冗余但难以剪除的问题，提供更公平的剪枝机会。

Method: 将滤波器置于投影空间，观察梯度下降运动方向（是否朝向原点）以衡量剪枝可能性，构建PROscore。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了近乎无损的剪枝，减少了性能下降，并在微调后表现优异。

Conclusion: 打破了剪枝中“大小决定一切”的迷思，从理论和实证上扩展了基于重要性的剪枝方法。

Abstract: With the growth of demand on neural network compression methods, the
structured pruning methods including importance-based approach are actively
studied. The magnitude importance and many correlated modern importance
criteria often limit the capacity of pruning decision, since the filters with
larger magnitudes are not likely to be pruned if the smaller one didn't, even
if it is redundant. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to
challenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each
filter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe
the gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or
not, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used
to construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel
importance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference. Our evaluation
results shows that the proposed importance criteria using the projective space
achieves near-lossless pruning by reducing the performance drop in pruning,
with promising performance after the finetuning. Our work debunks the
``size-matters'' myth in pruning and expands the frontier of importance-based
pruning both theoretically and empirically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在单次尝试中难以完成复杂程序合成任务，进化方法受限于固定生成模型能力。

Method: SOAR通过交替进化搜索和后见学习，利用LLM采样和优化候选方案，并通过微调提升模型能力。

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准测试中，SOAR显著提升性能，解决了52%的公共测试集问题。

Conclusion: SOAR通过自我改进循环和任务间正迁移，有效提升了程序合成的能力。

Abstract: Many program synthesis tasks prove too challenging for even state-of-the-art
language models to solve in single attempts. Search-based evolutionary methods
offer a promising alternative by exploring solution spaces iteratively, but
their effectiveness remain limited by the fixed capabilities of the underlying
generative model.
  We propose SOAR, a method that learns program synthesis by integrating
language models into a self-improving evolutionary loop.
  SOAR alternates between (1) an evolutionary search that uses an LLM to sample
and refine candidate solutions, and (2) a hindsight learning phase that
converts search attempts into valid problem-solution pairs used to fine-tune
the LLM's sampling and refinement capabilities\, -- \,enabling increasingly
effective search in subsequent iterations.
  On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, SOAR achieves significant performance
gains across model scales and iterations, leveraging positive transfer between
the sampling and refinement finetuning tasks. These improvements carry over to
test-time adaptation, enabling SOAR to solve 52\% of the public test set. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测模型依赖单模态数据或早期融合策略，无法捕捉精神病数据的复杂多模态特性，需要更先进的融合技术。

Method: 使用BRIGHTEN临床试验数据，比较了随机森林（RF）的早期融合和基于自动编码器与神经网络的组合模型（CM）的潜在空间融合。

Result: CM在所有设置中表现优于RF和线性回归（LR），MSE更低（0.4985 vs. 0.5305），R2更高（0.4695 vs. 0.4356），且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 潜在空间融合是多模态心理健康数据预测的强有力方法，未来需探索模型可解释性和个体化预测。

Abstract: Background: Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety require improved
methods for early detection and personalized intervention. Traditional
predictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that
fail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced
integration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer
better accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN
clinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting
daily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented
with a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a
Combined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset
included behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features.
Experiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream
combinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and
coefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and
Linear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985
vs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed
signs of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance,
while the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when
integrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF),
underscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear
interactions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion
offers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with
multimodal mental health data. Future work should explore model
interpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment.

Result: 发现AI模型在深色皮肤人群中表现显著较差，提出公平性泛化的量化标准。

Conclusion: 强调事后公平性审计、数据集透明度和包容性验证的重要性，为AI系统中的结构性不平等提供诊断工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly inform medical
decision-making, yet concerns about algorithmic bias and inequitable outcomes
persist, particularly for historically marginalized populations. This paper
introduces the concept of Predictive Representativity (PR), a framework of
fairness auditing that shifts the focus from the composition of the data set to
outcomes-level equity. Through a case study in dermatology, we evaluated
AI-based skin cancer classifiers trained on the widely used HAM10000 dataset
and on an independent clinical dataset (BOSQUE Test set) from Colombia. Our
analysis reveals substantial performance disparities by skin phototype, with
classifiers consistently underperforming for individuals with darker skin,
despite proportional sampling in the source data. We argue that
representativity must be understood not as a static feature of datasets but as
a dynamic, context-sensitive property of model predictions. PR operationalizes
this shift by quantifying how reliably models generalize fairness across
subpopulations and deployment contexts. We further propose an External
Transportability Criterion that formalizes the thresholds for fairness
generalization. Our findings highlight the ethical imperative for post-hoc
fairness auditing, transparency in dataset documentation, and inclusive model
validation pipelines. This work offers a scalable tool for diagnosing
structural inequities in AI systems, contributing to discussions on equity,
interpretability, and data justice and fostering a critical re-evaluation of
fairness in data-driven healthcare.

Abstract: This paper aims to understand the training solution, which is obtained by the
back-propagation algorithm, of two-layer neural networks whose hidden layer is
composed of the units with smooth activation functions, including the usual
sigmoid type most commonly used before the advent of ReLUs. The mechanism
contains four main principles: construction of Taylor series expansions, strict
partial order of knots, smooth-spline implementation and smooth-continuity
restriction. The universal approximation for arbitrary input dimensionality is
proved and experimental verification is given, through which the mystery of
``black box'' of the solution space is largely revealed. The new proofs
employed also enrich approximation theory.

Motivation: 深度学习应用中，OOD检测对可靠性至关重要，但现有基于距离的方法因极端特征导致ID样本得分过低，限制了检测能力。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和CIFAR-10上的实验表明，FBE方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FBE方法简单有效，能显著提升OOD检测性能，并通过理论分析和补充实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensuring the reliability
of deep learning applications and has attracted significant attention in recent
years. A rich body of literature has emerged to develop efficient score
functions that assign high scores to in-distribution (ID) samples and low
scores to OOD samples, thereby helping distinguish OOD samples. Among these
methods, distance-based score functions are widely used because of their
efficiency and ease of use. However, deep learning often leads to a biased
distribution of data features, and extreme features are inevitable. These
extreme features make the distance-based methods tend to assign too low scores
to ID samples. This limits the OOD detection capabilities of such methods. To
address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Feature Bank
Enhancement (FBE), that uses statistical characteristics from dataset to
identify and constrain extreme features to the separation boundaries, therapy
making the distance between samples inside and outside the distribution
farther. We conducted experiments on large-scale ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10
respectively, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both benchmark. Additionally, theoretical analysis and
supplementary experiments are conducted to provide more insights into our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的激活稀疏性为降低计算成本提供了机会，但直接在神经元级别预测激活模式计算成本过高。

Method: 提出一种聚类方法，将相似的激活模式分组为少量代表性聚类，而非独立处理每个神经元。

Result: 聚类精度达79.34%，困惑度（PPL）仅轻微下降（最低12.49），显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法为激活模式预测提供了高效基础，有望提升大规模语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant activation sparsity, where
only a subset of neurons are active for a given input. Although this sparsity
presents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it
requires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct
prediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast
number of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and
utilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation
pattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently,
we group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative
clusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming
standard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in
perplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our
approach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness
in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By
predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future
models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids.
We detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing
meaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve
sparse computation efficiency. This clustering-based formulation serves as a
foundation for future work on activation pattern prediction, paving the way for
efficient inference in large-scale language models.

Abstract: In line with the AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness are
crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable performance in millimeter-wave
(mmWave) systems. Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but
deep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection
overhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to
adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam
alignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)
systems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements
from wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of
exhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data
collection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate
synthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model
refinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model
residing in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging
mismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce
beam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep
Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,
prioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also
incorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a
credibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring
robust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead
by 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving
near-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to
traditional softmax based DL models.

Result: 在仅有10%标注数据的挑战性任务中，SSFL-DCSL比现有方法准确率提升1.15%至7.85%。

Conclusion: SSFL-DCSL有效解决了标签稀缺和数据分布差异问题，同时保护用户隐私，提升了故障诊断性能。

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe
operation of industrial machinery and improving production efficiency. However,
traditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training
data and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally,
the cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire.
Meanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the
model's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a
semi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual
contrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for
distributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy.
It enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and
facilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving
mutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically,
first, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is
designed to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the
semi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced
to mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising
local contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are
aggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to
share knowledge among clients. To evaluate the proposed SSFL-DCSL framework,
experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets and a dataset
collected on motors from the factory. In the most challenging task, where only
10\% of the data are labeled, the proposed SSFL-DCSL can improve accuracy by
1.15% to 7.85% over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出B4模型，通过结合价格序列和外部信号，捕捉牛市和熊市动态，提升市场趋势预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场行为复杂，受历史价格和外部叙事（如新闻、社交媒体情绪）影响，投资者异质性导致建模困难。本文探索牛市和熊市动态对市场行为的影响。

Method: 提出B4模型，将价格序列和外部信号嵌入共享潜在空间，通过惯性配对和双竞争机制捕捉行为差异和市场异质性。

Result: 实验表明B4在预测市场趋势上表现优异，并提供对偏差、行为和动态关系的可解释性。

Conclusion: B4模型有效捕捉市场动态，为理解投资者行为和市场趋势提供了新视角。

Abstract: Financial markets exhibit highly dynamic and complex behaviors shaped by both
historical price trajectories and exogenous narratives, such as news, policy
interpretations, and social media sentiment. The heterogeneity in these data
and the diverse insight of investors introduce biases that complicate the
modeling of market dynamics. Unlike prior work, this paper explores the
potential of bull and bear regimes in investor-driven market dynamics. Through
empirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic
relationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances
trend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we
propose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified
framework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual
signals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces
naturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation. Within this
space, an inertial pairing module pairs temporally adjacent samples to preserve
momentum, while the dual competition mechanism contrasts bullish and bearish
embeddings to capture behavioral divergence. Together, these components allow
B4 to model bias-driven asymmetry, behavioral inertia, and market
heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world financial datasets
demonstrate that our model not only achieves superior performance in predicting
market trends but also provides interpretable insights into the interplay of
biases, investor behaviors, and market dynamics.

TL;DR: LaCache是一种无需训练的KV缓存优化方法，通过阶梯形KV缓存模式和迭代压缩机制，提升LLMs的长距离建模能力和连续生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着序列长度增加，LLMs中的KV对数量激增，导致效率瓶颈，需要一种方法在不牺牲性能的情况下优化缓存。

Method: LaCache采用阶梯形KV缓存模式存储跨层KV对，并通过迭代压缩机制动态压缩旧缓存，释放空间。

Result: 实验验证LaCache能有效增强LLMs的长距离能力，并在固定缓存预算下实现高效连续生成。

Conclusion: LaCache为LLMs的长距离建模和连续生成提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
numerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for
processing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended
outputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in
LLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we
propose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free
method for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables
LLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range
modeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without
running out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key
innovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only
sequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from
shallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range
dependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range
capabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively
compresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache
size. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective
continuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across
various tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's
effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities. Our code is available

Abstract: This study aims to develop a deep learning system for an accessibility device
for the deaf or hearing impaired. The device will accurately localize and
identify sound sources in real time. This study will fill an important gap in
current research by leveraging machine learning techniques to target the
underprivileged community. The system includes three main components. 1.
JerryNet: A custom designed CNN architecture that determines the direction of
arrival (DoA) for nine possible directions. 2. Audio Classification: This model
is based on fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model
to identify the exact sound classes only based on audio. 3. Multimodal
integration model: This is an accurate sound localization model that combines
audio, visual, and text data to locate the exact sound sources in the images.
The part consists of two modules, one object detection using Yolov9 to generate
all the bounding boxes of the objects, and an audio visual localization model
to identify the optimal bounding box using complete Intersection over Union
(CIoU). The hardware consists of a four-microphone rectangular formation and a
camera mounted on glasses with a wristband for displaying necessary information
like direction. On a custom collected data set, JerryNet achieved a precision
of 91. 1% for the sound direction, outperforming all the baseline models. The
CLAP model achieved 98.5% and 95% accuracy on custom and AudioSet datasets,
respectively. The audio-visual localization model within component 3 yielded a
cIoU of 0.892 and an AUC of 0.658, surpassing other similar models. There are
many future potentials to this study, paving the way to creating a new
generation of accessibility devices.

ChoquetRank, achieving better ranking accuracy with fewer user interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为缺乏直接氢产量数据的地区提供客观、可重复的选址工具，替代主观专家评估。

Method: 采用多阶段AI框架，包括无监督多变量聚类、监督机器学习分类器和SHAP算法，整合气象、地形和时间数据。

Result: 模型准确率为98%，发现水资源接近度、海拔和季节变化是阿曼绿色氢选址的最关键因素。

Conclusion: 该框架为数据稀缺地区的绿色氢基础设施规划提供了可扩展的工具，帮助决策者做出科学决策。

Abstract: As nations seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, green hydrogen has
emerged as a promising strategic pathway toward decarbonisation, particularly
in solar-rich arid regions. However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen
production requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and
infrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct
hydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)
framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using
mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework
consists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering,
supervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm. The pipeline trains
on an integrated meteorological, topographic and temporal dataset and the
results revealed distinct spatial patterns of suitability and relative
influence of the variables. With model predictive accuracy of 98%, the result
also showed that water proximity, elevation and seasonal variation are the most
influential factors determining green hydrogen site suitability in Oman with
mean absolute shap values of 2.470891, 2.376296 and 1.273216 respectively.
Given limited or absence of ground-truth yield data in many countries that have
green hydrogen prospects and ambitions, this study offers an objective and
reproducible alternative to subjective expert weightings, thus allowing the
data to speak for itself and potentially discover novel latent groupings
without pre-imposed assumptions. This study offers industry stakeholders and
policymakers a replicable and scalable tool for green hydrogen infrastructure
planning and other decision making in data-scarce regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在梯度匹配中存在梯度波动和高计算开销的问题，需要一种更高效且稳定的解决方案。

Method: 利用梯度轨迹作为数据，在元学习器中独立训练，最大化梯度内积（GIP）同时限制梯度偏离经验风险最小化轨迹。

Result: 在DomainBed数据集上表现优于基线方法，同时计算效率高。

Conclusion: POGM方法有效解决了梯度波动和计算开销问题，实现了多领域知识的稳定整合。

Abstract: In this study, we address the gradient-based domain generalization problem,
where predictors aim for consistent gradient directions across different
domains. Existing methods have two main challenges. First, minimization of
gradient empirical distance or gradient inner products (GIP) leads to gradient
fluctuations among domains, thereby hindering straightforward learning. Second,
the direct application of gradient learning to the joint loss function can
incur high computation overheads due to second-order derivative approximation.
To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Pareto Optimality Gradient
Matching (POGM) method. In contrast to existing methods that add gradient
matching as regularization, we leverage gradient trajectories as collected data
and apply independent training at the meta-learner. In the meta-update, we
maximize GIP while limiting the learned gradient from deviating too far from
the empirical risk minimization gradient trajectory. By doing so, the aggregate
gradient can incorporate knowledge from all domains without suffering gradient
fluctuation towards any particular domain. Experimental evaluations on datasets
from DomainBed demonstrate competitive results yielded by POGM against other
baselines while achieving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental
science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex

progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted
generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest

a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through
multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization,
handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that
multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and
identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference
and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for
high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction
endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro
applications.

Motivation: 结合非线性扩散映射的几何优势与线性方法（如PCA）的计算效率和可解释性。

Method: 通过线性近似扩散映射核构建LDM，并在合成和真实数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: LDM在具有流形结构的数据集中优于PCA，而PCA在噪声或方差主导的场景中更优。LDM的核矩阵完全正定性支持NMF应用。

Conclusion: LDM是一种有前景的线性降维技术，具有理论和实践扩展潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the Linearized Diffusion Map (LDM), a novel linear
dimensionality reduction method constructed via a linear approximation of the
diffusion-map kernel. LDM integrates the geometric intuition of diffusion-based
nonlinear methods with the computational simplicity, efficiency, and
interpretability inherent in linear embeddings such as PCA and classical MDS.
Through comprehensive experiments on synthetic datasets (Swiss roll and
hyperspheres) and real-world benchmarks (MNIST and COIL-20), we illustrate that
LDM captures distinct geometric features of datasets compared to PCA, offering
complementary advantages. Specifically, LDM embeddings outperform PCA in
datasets exhibiting explicit manifold structures, particularly in
high-dimensional regimes, whereas PCA remains preferable in scenarios dominated
by variance or noise. Furthermore, the complete positivity of LDM's kernel
matrix allows direct applicability of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF),
suggesting opportunities for interpretable latent-structure discovery. Our
analysis positions LDM as a valuable new linear dimensionality reduction
technique with promising theoretical and practical extensions.

Conclusion: UFO方法有效提升了大模型在多轮问题解决中的反馈响应能力，同时设计了奖励机制以优化答案多样性。

Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing
Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a
single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models
trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems
across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual
feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect
their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training
models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again")
after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn
reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement
learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative
problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training
setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn
performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling
language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To
further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while
encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures
that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn. Code:

Conclusion: FedStrategist提供了一种可分析、实用的方法，增强了去中心化AI系统的鲁棒性和智能性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a paradigm for privacy-preserving
collaborative AI, but its decentralized nature creates significant
vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks. While numerous static defenses
exist, their effectiveness is highly context-dependent, often failing against
adaptive adversaries or in heterogeneous data environments. This paper
introduces FedStrategist, a novel meta-learning framework that reframes robust
aggregation as a real-time, cost-aware control problem. We design a lightweight
contextual bandit agent that dynamically selects the optimal aggregation rule
from an arsenal of defenses based on real-time diagnostic metrics. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that no single static rule is
universally optimal. We show that our adaptive agent successfully learns
superior policies across diverse scenarios, including a ``Krum-favorable"
environment and against a sophisticated "stealth" adversary designed to
neutralize specific diagnostic signals. Critically, we analyze the paradoxical
scenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy,
and demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model
integrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a
single "risk tolerance" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage
the trade-off between performance and security. Our work provides a new,
practical, and analyzable approach to creating resilient and intelligent
decentralized AI systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为深度伪造检测中的个体公平性问题提供了首个通用解决方案，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Generative AI models have substantially improved the realism of synthetic
media, yet their misuse through sophisticated DeepFakes poses significant
risks. Despite recent advances in deepfake detection, fairness remains
inadequately addressed, enabling deepfake markers to exploit biases against
specific populations. While previous studies have emphasized group-level
fairness, individual fairness (i.e., ensuring similar predictions for similar
individuals) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify for the
first time that the original principle of individual fairness fundamentally
fails in the context of deepfake detection, revealing a critical gap previously
unexplored in the literature. To mitigate it, we propose the first
generalizable framework that can be integrated into existing deepfake detectors
to enhance individual fairness and generalization. Extensive experiments
conducted on leading deepfake datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves individual fairness while maintaining robust detection
performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Method: 研究采用混合方法，结合确定性基础模型和机器学习预测残差，开发了四种ML模型，并使用环形几何实验数据进行训练和验证。

Result: ML模型的平均相对误差低于3.5%，显著优于经验模型（误差高于26%）。

Conclusion: 混合ML模型在预测环形几何中的CHF方面表现出色，为反应堆安全分析提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) is an essential component of
safety analysis in pressurized and boiling water reactors. To support reliable
prediction of this quantity, several empirical correlations and lookup tables
have been constructed from physical experiments over the past several decades.
With the onset of accessible machine learning (ML) frameworks, multiple
initiatives have been established with the goal of predicting CHF more
accurately than these traditional methods. While purely data-driven surrogate
modeling has been extensively investigated, these approaches lack
interpretability, lack resilience to data scarcity, and have been developed
mostly using data from tube experiments. As a result, bias-correction hybrid
approaches have become increasingly popular, which correct initial
"low-fidelity" estimates provided by deterministic base models by using
ML-predicted residuals. This body of work has mostly considered round tube
geometries; annular geometry-specific ML models have not yet been deployed in
thermal hydraulic codes. This study developed, deployed, and validated four ML
models to predict CHF in annular geometries using the CTF subchannel code.
Three empirical correlation models, Biasi, Bowring, and Katto, were used as
base models for comparison. The ML models were trained and tested using 577
experimental annulus data points from four datasets: Becker, Beus, Janssen, and
Mortimore. Baseline CHF predictions were obtained from the empirical
correlations, with mean relative errors above 26%. The ML-driven models
achieved mean relative errors below 3.5%, with no more than one point exceeding
the 10% error envelope. In all cases, the hybrid ML models significantly
outperformed their empirical counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类偏好数据集通常噪声较多，影响模型性能，需要有效方法检测和过滤有害数据。

Method: 采用共轭梯度近似影响函数方法过滤训练数据，并通过梯度相似性检测有益数据。

Result: 过滤10%训练数据后，准确率提升1.5%；梯度相似性在检测有益数据上优于影响函数。

Conclusion: 局部曲率对检测有害数据重要，但对有益数据检测影响较小。

Abstract: Language models are commonly fine-tuned via reinforcement learning to alter
their behavior or elicit new capabilities. Datasets used for these purposes,
and particularly human preference datasets, are often noisy. The relatively
small size post-training datasets, combined with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, enable the use of influence functions approximations to
detect and prune training examples that are harmful to performance on a
validation set. In this work, we adapt the TL;DR dataset for reward model
training to demonstrate how conjugate-gradient approximated influence functions
can be used to filter datasets. In our experiments, influence function
filtering yields a small retraining accuracy uplift of 1.5% after removing 10%
of training examples. We also show that gradient similarity outperforms
influence functions for detecting helpful training examples. This suggests that
local curvature is important for detecting harmful training examples, but less
so for identifying helpful examples.

Motivation: 现有方法如LoRA主要调整注意力权重矩阵，而Solo Connection通过解码器块级别的表示调整，结合同伦理论实现平滑稳定适应。

Method: 引入可训练的线性变换，逐步插值于零向量和任务特定表示之间，同时探索长跳跃连接以增强模型适应能力。

Result: Solo Connection在E2E自然语言生成基准上优于LoRA，可训练参数减少59%（相比LoRA）和99%以上（相比全微调）。

Conclusion: Solo Connection通过解码器块级别调整和长跳跃连接，为大规模语言模型的高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach
for adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most
prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on
adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a
Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo
Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block
level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo
Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but
it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and
by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy
theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually
interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation,
enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the
original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks,
subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models
can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore
the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This
paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder
blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while
leveraging pre-trained knowledge.

poses serious risks to public safety, demanding detection methods that
effectively capture complex system interdependencies and adapt to evolving
attack patterns. Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often
suffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to
high data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent
research has explored modeling causal relationships among system components.
However, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches
that require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time
settings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability
to adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the
risk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live
systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework
for incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack
detection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by
incrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The
framework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects
transitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions
across sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning:
Leverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal
structures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification:
Employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the
learned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical
infrastructure datasets demonstrate that INCADET achieves superior accuracy,
robustness, and adaptability compared to both static causal and deep temporal
baselines in evolving attack scenarios.

Motivation: 研究简单测试时缩放方法的有效性，并探讨其与o1类模型在性能扩展上的差异。

Method: 分析简单测试时缩放方法（包括限制最大长度和追加“Wait”），并与o1类模型的自然扩展行为进行对比。

Result: 限制最大长度的缩放方法有效，但追加“Wait”会导致不一致性；o1类模型通过强化学习自然扩展计算能力，性能更优。

Conclusion: 简单测试时缩放方法仅能模拟缩放行为，而o1类模型的自然扩展能力能实现更高性能。

Abstract: Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this
scaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually
controlling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum
length or scaling up by iteratively appending "Wait" when the model is about to
terminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time
scaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling
down by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data
distilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,
and scaling up by appending "Wait" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may
oscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by
enforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,
such as DeepSeek-R1\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much
compute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported
length. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during
reinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when
scaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower
upper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the
test-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down,
it is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to
unlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve --
rather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.

Abstract: In this work, we study how to efficiently apply reinforcement learning (RL)
for solving large-scale stochastic optimization problems by leveraging
intervention models. The key of the proposed methodology is to better explore
the solution space by simulating and composing the stochastic processes using
pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. We demonstrate our approach on a
challenging real-world application, the multi-sourcing multi-period inventory
management problem in supply chain optimization. In particular, we employ deep
RL models for learning and forecasting the stochastic supply chain processes
under a range of assumptions. Moreover, we also introduce a constraint
coordination mechanism, designed to forecast dual costs given the
cross-products constraints in the inventory network. We highlight that instead
of directly modeling the complex physical constraints into the RL optimization
problem and solving the stochastic problem as a whole, our approach breaks down
those supply chain processes into scalable and composable DL modules, leading
to improved performance on large real-world datasets. We also outline open
problems for future research to further investigate the efficacy of such
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法假设节点标签条件独立，忽略了图中标签的相关性，ReDiSC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用重参数化掩码扩散模型和变分EM框架估计节点标签的联合分布。

Result: 在多种图上表现优于或接近现有GNN、标签传播和扩散方法，且能扩展到大规模数据集。

Conclusion: ReDiSC在结构化节点分类任务中具有显著优势，尤其适用于大规模数据。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved unprecedented
successes in node classification tasks. Although GNNs inherently encode
specific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most
existing methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels
in their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for
traditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the
intuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after
conditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node
labels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for
Structured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node
labels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through
the variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical
analysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to
DPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained
diffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's
M-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation,
and diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of
varying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on
which previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational
constraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured
node classification tasks.

Conclusion: FRL-EH框架和FedRQ算法在异质环境中表现优越，为联邦强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate a Federated Reinforcement Learning with Environment
Heterogeneity (FRL-EH) framework, where local environments exhibit statistical
heterogeneity. Within this framework, agents collaboratively learn a global
policy by aggregating their collective experiences while preserving the privacy
of their local trajectories. To better reflect real-world scenarios, we
introduce a robust FRL-EH framework by presenting a novel global objective
function. This function is specifically designed to optimize a global policy
that ensures robust performance across heterogeneous local environments and
their plausible perturbations. We propose a tabular FRL algorithm named FedRQ
and theoretically prove its asymptotic convergence to an optimal policy for the
global objective function. Furthermore, we extend FedRQ to environments with
continuous state space through the use of expectile loss, addressing the key
challenge of minimizing a value function over a continuous subset of the state
space. This advancement facilitates the seamless integration of the principles
of FedRQ with various Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL algorithms. Extensive
empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness and robustness of our FRL
algorithms across diverse heterogeneous environments, consistently achieving
superior performance over the existing state-of-the-art FRL algorithms.

*Satyankar Chandra,Ashutosh Gupta,Kaushik Mallik,Krishna Shankaranarayanan,Namrita Varshney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“glitches”的新不可靠行为来源，它可能显著影响具有陡峭决策边界的AI模型的可靠性。作者提供了glitches的正式定义，并通过实验证明其广泛存在，同时开发了一种基于MILP的算法来检测GBDT模型中的glitches。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多关键决策任务已委托给机器学习模型，确保其决策可信、可靠且输出一致至关重要。然而，现有模型可能存在未被充分研究的不可靠行为（glitches），影响其可靠性。

Method: 作者首先形式化定义了glitches，并通过文献中的模型和数据集验证其广泛存在。随后，针对梯度提升决策树（GBDT）模型，提出了一种基于混合整数线性规划（MILP）的glitch检测算法。

Result: 实验表明，glitches在多种模型中普遍存在，且通常指示模型在特定邻域内的不一致性。作者证明了检测glitches对树集成模型是NP完全问题，但其算法在实际基准测试中表现出有效性和计算可行性。

Conclusion: glitches是影响AI模型可靠性的重要因素，其检测具有挑战性但可行。论文提出的方法为提升模型可靠性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Many critical decision-making tasks are now delegated to machine-learned
models, and it is imperative that their decisions are trustworthy and reliable,
and their outputs are consistent across similar inputs. We identify a new
source of unreliable behaviors-called glitches-which may significantly impair
the reliability of AI models having steep decision boundaries. Roughly
speaking, glitches are small neighborhoods in the input space where the model's
output abruptly oscillates with respect to small changes in the input. We
provide a formal definition of glitches, and use well-known models and datasets
from the literature to demonstrate that they have widespread existence and
argue they usually indicate potential model inconsistencies in the neighborhood
of where they are found. We proceed to the algorithmic search of glitches for
widely used gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) models. We prove that the
problem of detecting glitches is NP-complete for tree ensembles, already for
trees of depth 4. Our glitch-search algorithm for GBDT models uses an MILP
encoding of the problem, and its effectiveness and computational feasibility
are demonstrated on a set of widely used GBDT benchmarks taken from the
literature.

Motivation: 解决知识蒸馏中的高维优化问题和缺乏标签语义监督的挑战。

Method: 提出GenDD框架，结合Split Tokenization实现稳定无监督蒸馏，并通过Distribution Contraction技术引入标签监督。

Result: 在ImageNet验证集上，无监督设置下性能显著超越KL基线16.29%；监督设置下，ResNet-50达到82.28%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: GenDD框架在无监督和监督知识蒸馏中均表现出色，为多任务学习提供了高效的梯度级替代方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the knowledge distillation (KD) as a conditional
generative problem and propose the \textit{Generative Distribution Distillation
(GenDD)} framework. A naive \textit{GenDD} baseline encounters two major
challenges: the curse of high-dimensional optimization and the lack of semantic
supervision from labels. To address these issues, we introduce a \textit{Split
Tokenization} strategy, achieving stable and effective unsupervised KD.
Additionally, we develop the \textit{Distribution Contraction} technique to
integrate label supervision into the reconstruction objective. Our theoretical
proof demonstrates that \textit{GenDD} with \textit{Distribution Contraction}
serves as a gradient-level surrogate for multi-task learning, realizing
efficient supervised training without explicit classification loss on
multi-step sampling image representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we conduct experiments on balanced, imbalanced, and unlabeled data.
Experimental results show that \textit{GenDD} performs competitively in the
unsupervised setting, significantly surpassing KL baseline by \textbf{16.29\%}
on ImageNet validation set. With label supervision, our ResNet-50 achieves
\textbf{82.28\%} top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in 600 epochs training,
establishing a new state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法（如MSE）对振幅敏感、对波形极性不变且尺度无界，阻碍了语义对齐和可解释性。

Method: SDSC基于Dice相似系数，量化时间信号的结构一致性，并通过可微分近似实现梯度优化。还提出了一种结合MSE的混合损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，SDSC在预测和分类任务中表现优于或与MSE相当，尤其在领域内和低资源场景中。

Conclusion: 结构感知度量（如SDSC）能提升信号表示的语义质量，可作为传统距离方法的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware
metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt
distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive
to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These
properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC
addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals
based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware
metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a
differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based
optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with
MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments
on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based
pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly
in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural
fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation
quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable
alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.

Motivation: 在观测性研究中，缺乏明确标记的控制组是一个常见挑战，而随机实验往往难以实施或成本高昂。

Result: 实验表明，PU学习能成功从未标记数据中识别控制组，并估计出接近真实值的ATE。

Conclusion: 该方法对观测性因果推断有重要意义，尤其适用于难以进行随机实验的领域，如农业和环境科学。

Abstract: In causal inference, whether through randomized controlled trials or
observational studies, access to both treated and control units is essential
for estimating the effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest. When
treatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be
estimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized
settings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and
approximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common
challenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly
labeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To
address this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for
identifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones,
using only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach
using both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with
diverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various
scenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow
estimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal
sowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture. Our findings show
that PU learning can successfully identify control (negative) units from
unlabeled data based only on treated units and, through the resulting control
group, estimate an ATE that closely approximates the true value. This work has
important implications for observational causal inference, especially in fields
where randomized experiments are difficult or costly. In domains such as earth,
environmental, and agricultural sciences, it enables a plethora of
quasi-experiments by leveraging available earth observation and climate data,
particularly when treated units are available but control units are lacking.

Conclusion: 该方法在非线性奖励推断和无限时域建模上具有优势，适用于复杂博弈场景。

Abstract: We consider the maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning problem
for infinite-horizon stationary mean-field games, in which we model the unknown
reward function within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This allows the
inference of rich and potentially nonlinear reward structures directly from
expert demonstrations, in contrast to most existing inverse reinforcement
learning approaches for mean-field games that typically restrict the reward
function to a linear combination of a fixed finite set of basis functions. We
also focus on the infinite-horizon cost structure, whereas prior studies
primarily rely on finite-horizon formulations. We introduce a Lagrangian
relaxation to this maximum causal entropy inverse reinforcement learning
problem that enables us to reformulate it as an unconstrained log-likelihood
maximization problem, and obtain a solution \lk{via} a gradient ascent
algorithm. To illustrate the theoretical consistency of the algorithm, we
establish the smoothness of the log-likelihood objective by proving the
Fr\'echet differentiability of the related soft Bellman operators with respect
to the parameters in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a mean-field traffic routing game, where it
accurately recovers expert behavior.

Conclusion: 论文通过亲和矩阵的统一视角，连接了多种机器学习模型和任务。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such
as Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational
principle: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how
information flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of
self-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural
language processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an
affinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)
as a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based
weighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS
defines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature
relevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this
perspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a
single-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token
similarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise
relationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie
in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention
within the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several
strands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical
foundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in surveillance,
logistics, agriculture, disaster management, and military operations. Accurate
detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising,
ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective
operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods
often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while
state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures
typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs,
especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel
framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address
these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder
captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while
the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL
is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments,
reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the
proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and
98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The
framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust
generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its
potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.

Motivation: 传统的k-PCA方法对噪声和异常值敏感，而k-子空间中位数更具鲁棒性，但因其非凸性难以高效近似。

Result: 算法在近似因子为√d的情况下，运行时间为多项式时间，且在真实数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法为k-子空间中位数问题提供了高效解决方案，并有望推广到其他相关问题。

Abstract: Given an integer $k\geq1$ and a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\REAL^d$, the
classic $k$-PCA (Principle Component Analysis) approximates the affine
\emph{$k$-subspace mean} of $P$, which is the $k$-dimensional affine linear
subspace that minimizes its sum of squared Euclidean distances
($\ell_{2,2}$-norm) over the points of $P$, i.e., the mean of these distances.
The \emph{$k$-subspace median} is the subspace that minimizes its sum of
(non-squared) Euclidean distances ($\ell_{2,1}$-mixed norm), i.e., their
median. The median subspace is usually more sparse and robust to noise/outliers
than the mean, but also much harder to approximate since, unlike the
$\ell_{z,z}$ (non-mixed) norms, it is non-convex for $k<d-1$.
  We provide the first polynomial-time deterministic algorithm whose both
running time and approximation factor are not exponential in $k$. More
precisely, the multiplicative approximation factor is $\sqrt{d}$, and the
running time is polynomial in the size of the input. We expect that our
technique would be useful for many other related problems, such as $\ell_{2,z}$
norm of distances for $z\not \in \br{1,2}$, e.g., $z=\infty$, and handling
outliers/sparsity.
  Open code and experimental results on real-world datasets are also provided.

Conclusion: Rec-AD增强了边缘计算能力和可扩展性，为智能电网安全提供技术支持。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been widely adopted for False Data Injection Attack
(FDIA) detection in smart grids due to their ability to capture unstructured
and sparse features. However, the increasing system scale and data
dimensionality introduce significant computational and memory burdens,
particularly in large-scale industrial datasets, limiting detection efficiency.
To address these issues, this paper proposes Rec-AD, a computationally
efficient framework that integrates Tensor Train decomposition with the Deep
Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). Rec-AD enhances training and inference
efficiency through embedding compression, optimized data access via index
reordering, and a pipeline training mechanism that reduces memory communication
overhead. Fully compatible with PyTorch, Rec-AD can be integrated into existing
FDIA detection systems without code modifications. Experimental results show
that Rec-AD significantly improves computational throughput and real-time
detection performance, narrowing the attack window and increasing attacker
cost. These advancements strengthen edge computing capabilities and
scalability, providing robust technical support for smart grid security.

TL;DR: 论文提出AD-GCL框架，解决图对比学习在异常检测中对结构不平衡的鲁棒性问题，特别关注低度节点的尾部异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCL模型过度关注整体检测性能，忽视结构不平衡的鲁棒性，导致尾部异常检测不足，影响高风险场景应用。

Method: AD-GCL采用邻居修剪策略过滤噪声边，通过异常引导邻居补全扩展尾部节点感知范围，并引入视图一致性损失增强表示。

Result: 实验验证AD-GCL在整体、头部和尾部节点异常检测中的全面优越性。

Conclusion: AD-GCL显著提升对结构不平衡的鲁棒性，适用于高风险场景。

Abstract: The superiority of graph contrastive learning (GCL) has prompted its
application to anomaly detection tasks for more powerful risk warning systems.
Unfortunately, existing GCL-based models tend to excessively prioritize overall
detection performance while neglecting robustness to structural imbalance,
which can be problematic for many real-world networks following power-law
degree distributions. Particularly, GCL-based methods may fail to capture tail
anomalies (abnormal nodes with low degrees). This raises concerns about the
security and robustness of current anomaly detection algorithms and therefore
hinders their applicability in a variety of realistic high-risk scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, research on the robustness of graph anomaly
detection to structural imbalance has received little scrutiny. To address the
above issues, this paper presents a novel GCL-based framework named AD-GCL. It
devises the neighbor pruning strategy to filter noisy edges for head nodes and
facilitate the detection of genuine tail nodes by aligning from head nodes to
forged tail nodes. Moreover, AD-GCL actively explores potential neighbors to
enlarge the receptive field of tail nodes through anomaly-guided neighbor
completion. We further introduce intra- and inter-view consistency loss of the
original and augmentation graph for enhanced representation. The performance
evaluation of the whole, head, and tail nodes on multiple datasets validates
the comprehensive superiority of the proposed AD-GCL in detecting both head
anomalies and tail anomalies.

Motivation: 互联网上垃圾文本的指数增长带来了信息泄露和社会不稳定等风险，需要有效的检测机制。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，GCC-Spam在检测率和标注数据效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GCC-Spam框架通过创新方法有效解决了垃圾文本检测中的关键挑战，具有较高的实用价值。

Abstract: The exponential growth of spam text on the Internet necessitates robust
detection mechanisms to mitigate risks such as information leakage and social
instability. This work addresses two principal challenges: adversarial
strategies employed by spammers and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose a
novel spam-text detection framework GCC-Spam, which integrates three core
innovations. First, a character similarity network captures orthographic and
phonetic features to counter character-obfuscation attacks and furthermore
produces sentence embeddings for downstream classification. Second, contrastive
learning enhances discriminability by optimizing the latent-space distance
between spam and normal texts. Third, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
generates realistic pseudo-spam samples to alleviate data scarcity while
improving model robustness and classification accuracy. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline
approaches, achieving higher detection rates with significantly fewer labeled
examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG情感识别在脑机通信系统中至关重要，但面临非平稳空间-时间模式整合和动态情感强度变化的挑战。

Method: SST-CL框架包含空间编码器（建模通道间关系）和时间编码器（通过窗口注意力机制捕获多尺度依赖），并结合强度感知课程学习策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融研究验证了框架各部分的必要性。

Conclusion: SST-CL有效整合了空间-时间模式并适应动态情感强度，为EEG情感识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive
brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in
practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary
spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional
intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a
novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum
learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that
models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures
multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling
simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG
signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum
learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to
low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a
dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional
intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both
architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.

Conclusion: CPAC通过分类器驱动的表示学习，显著提升了欺诈检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions remains a significant
challenge, due to the extreme class imbalance in real-world data and the often
subtle patterns that separate fraud from legitimate activity. Existing research
commonly attempts to address this by generating synthetic samples for the
minority class using approaches such as GANs, VAEs, or hybrid generative
models. However, these techniques, particularly when applied only to
minority-class data, tend to result in overconfident classifiers and poor
latent cluster separation, ultimately limiting real-world detection
performance. In this study, we propose the Causal Prototype Attention
Classifier (CPAC), an interpretable architecture that promotes class-aware
clustering and improved latent space structure through prototype-based
attention mechanisms and we will couple it with the encoder in a VAE-GAN
allowing it to offer a better cluster separation moving beyond post-hoc sample
augmentation. We compared CPAC-augmented models to traditional oversamplers,
such as SMOTE, as well as to state-of-the-art generative models, both with and
without CPAC-based latent classifiers. Our results show that classifier-guided
latent shaping with CPAC delivers superior performance, achieving an F1-score
of 93.14\% percent and recall of 90.18\%, along with improved latent cluster
separation. Further ablation studies and visualizations provide deeper insight
into the benefits and limitations of classifier-driven representation learning
for fraud detection. The codebase for this work will be available at final
submission.

Motivation: 随着生成AI模型（如LLMs）在实时多模型应用（如视频会议和游戏）中的集成，RTGen工作负载的需求日益增长，但其在异构SoC上的调度复杂性和性能影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究在AMD的Ryzen AI异构SoC上对RTGen工作负载进行全面表征，构建多模型场景，评估五种调度策略对实时指标和LLM性能的影响。

Result: 调度决策显著影响性能（如平均导致41.7%的截止时间违规率差异），表明需要动态异构调度策略。

Conclusion: 动态异构调度是实现高性能RTGen应用的关键，需结合工作负载动态和硬件异构性。

Abstract: The integration of generative AI models, particularly large language models
(LLMs), into real-time multi-model AI applications such as video conferencing
and gaming is giving rise to a new class of workloads: real-time generative AI
(RTGen). These workloads combine the compute intensity and dynamic execution
patterns of generative models with the stringent latency and concurrency
constraints of real-time inference. To meet the diverse demands of RTGen
workloads, modern edge platforms increasingly adopt heterogeneous
system-on-chip (SoC) architectures that integrate CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. Despite
the potential of heterogeneous SoC, the scheduling space complexity and
performance implications of RTGen workloads on such platforms remain
underexplored. In this work, we perform a comprehensive characterization of
RTGen workloads on AMD's latest heterogeneous SoC, Ryzen AI. We construct
realistic multi-model scenarios inspired by industry use cases and profile
model performance across all available backends. Using this data, we evaluate
five scheduling policies and their impact on both real-time metrics (e.g.,
deadline violation rate) and LLM performance (e.g., time-to-first-token and
tokens-per-second). Our results show that scheduling decisions significantly
affect workload performance (e.g., leading to a 41.7% difference in deadline
violation rates on average), and highlight the need for scheduling strategies
that are aware of workload dynamics and hardware heterogeneity. Our findings
underscore the importance of workload-aware, dynamic heterogeneous scheduling
in enabling high-performance, on-device RTGen applications.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LeanTree，一种白盒工具，用于改进自动定理证明（ATP）中与大型语言模型（LLMs）的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ATP因其庞大的状态和动作空间而具有挑战性，LLMs虽作为启发式方法有潜力，但缺乏正确性保证，且白盒方法落后于黑盒方法。

Method: 提出LeanTree，包括基于Lean 4语言的工具和分解后的中间状态数据集，支持增量证明构建和并行搜索。

Result: 初步结果表明，白盒方法在某些情况下优于黑盒方法。

Conclusion: LeanTree通过白盒工具提供了更简化的评估、更丰富的训练数据和更高效的错误反馈，填补了白盒方法的不足。

Abstract: Automated theorem proving (ATP) has been a classical problem in artificial
intelligence since its inception, yet it remains challenging due to its vast
state and action space. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a
promising heuristic for ATP, but they lack correctness guarantees and thus
require interaction with a proof verifier. Such interactions typically follow
one of two approaches: black-box interaction, which does not utilize
intermediate proof states, or white-box approaches, which allow for incremental
proof construction and examination of intermediate states. While black-box
approaches have directly benefited from recent LLM advances, white-box methods
have comparatively lagged behind. In this paper, we address this gap by
introducing LeanTree, which consists of (i) a tool built in the Lean 4 language
that factorizes complex proof states into simpler, independent branches, and
(ii) a dataset of these factorized intermediate states. Our white-box tooling
offers several advantages over black-box approaches: it simplifies evaluation,
reduces necessary context, generates richer training data, enables parallel
search across multiple states, supports efficient reuse of states, and provides
feedback in case of errors. Our preliminary results hint that white-box
approaches outperform black-box alternatives in some settings.

TL;DR: GRID是一个统一的持续学习框架，解决了任务无关推理下的潜在遗忘和提示内存爆炸问题，通过任务感知解码和梯度提示选择策略显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的持续学习方法通常假设任务感知推理并维护任务特定提示列表，限制了可扩展性并隐藏潜在遗忘。

Method: GRID结合任务感知解码机制（利用代表性输入、自动任务识别和约束解码）和梯度提示选择策略（压缩低信息量提示为单一聚合表示）。

Result: 实验表明，GRID显著提升后向迁移，减少遗忘任务达80%，在T5和Flan-T5上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GRID通过高效解码和提示压缩，实现了可扩展且内存高效的持续学习。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) offers a parameter-efficient way to
adapt large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most
existing methods assume task-aware inference and maintain a growing list of
task-specific prompts, which limits scalability and hides latent forgetting. In
this work, we introduce GRID, a unified framework that addresses two key
limitations: (1) latent forgetting under task-agnostic inference, and (2)
prompt memory explosion as task sequences grow. GRID integrates a task-aware
decoding mechanism that improves backward transfer by leveraging representative
inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Additionally,
we propose a gradient-based prompt selection strategy that compresses less
informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, enabling scalable
and memory-efficient lifelong learning. Extensive experiments across
short-sequence, long-sequence, and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID
significantly improves backward transfer, achieves competitive forward
transfer, and reduces forgotten tasks by up to 80\%, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on T5 and Flan-T5 backbones.

Motivation: 探索可训练有理激活函数在动态非平稳环境中的表现，尤其是其对训练稳定性的影响。

Method: 提出一种约束变体的有理激活函数，限制输出缩放以保持适应性。在MetaWorld和DMC环境中进行实验验证。

Result: 约束变体提高了训练稳定性和性能，并在持续学习任务中展示了表达性与长期保留之间的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为动态环境中设计稳健且适应性强的可训练激活函数提供了实用原则。

Abstract: Trainable activation functions, whose parameters are optimized alongside
network weights, offer increased expressivity compared to fixed activation
functions. Specifically, trainable activation functions defined as ratios of
polynomials (rational functions) have been proposed to enhance plasticity in
reinforcement learning. However, their impact on training stability remains
unclear. In this work, we study trainable rational activations in both
reinforcement and continual learning settings. We find that while their
flexibility enhances adaptability, it can also introduce instability, leading
to overestimation in RL and feature collapse in longer continual learning
scenarios. Our main result is demonstrating a trade-off between expressivity
and plasticity in rational activations. To address this, we propose a
constrained variant that structurally limits excessive output scaling while
preserving adaptability. Experiments across MetaWorld and DeepMind Control
Suite (DMC) environments show that our approach improves training stability and
performance. In continual learning benchmarks, including MNIST with reshuffled
labels and Split CIFAR-100, we reveal how different constraints affect the
balance between expressivity and long-term retention. While preliminary
experiments in discrete action domains (e.g., Atari) did not show similar
instability, this suggests that the trade-off is particularly relevant for
continuous control. Together, our findings provide actionable design principles
for robust and adaptable trainable activations in dynamic, non-stationary
environments. Code available at:

Motivation: 梯度基础的TDA方法（如影响函数和展开微分）需要高效近似iHVP，但现有方法难以实现。

Method: 提出ASTRA算法，结合EKFAC预条件器和Neumann级数迭代，优化iHVP近似。

Result: ASTRA比传统方法更准确、易调参且迭代次数更少，显著提升TDA性能。

Conclusion: ASTRA通过改进iHVP近似，为TDA提供了更高效和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) provides insights into which training data is
responsible for a learned model behavior. Gradient-based TDA methods such as
influence functions and unrolled differentiation both involve a computation
that resembles an inverse Hessian-vector product (iHVP), which is difficult to
approximate efficiently. We introduce an algorithm (ASTRA) which uses the
EKFAC-preconditioner on Neumann series iterations to arrive at an accurate iHVP
approximation for TDA. ASTRA is easy to tune, requires fewer iterations than
Neumann series iterations, and is more accurate than EKFAC-based
approximations. Using ASTRA, we show that improving the accuracy of the iHVP
approximation can significantly improve TDA performance.

Motivation: 现有自动化机器学习系统通常只关注单一最优模型，忽略了解释不确定性，这在以人为中心的AI中至关重要。

Method: 提出Rashomon PDP框架，通过聚合多个近优模型的PDP，捕捉解释变异性。

Result: 实验表明，Rashomon PDP在大多数情况下覆盖不到最佳模型PDP的70%，突显单一模型解释的局限性。

Conclusion: Rashomon PDP通过补充被忽略的信息，提高了模型解释的可靠性和可信度，适用于高风险领域。

Abstract: Automated machine learning systems efficiently streamline model selection but
often focus on a single best-performing model, overlooking explanation
uncertainty, an essential concern in human centered explainable AI. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that incorporates model multiplicity into
explanation generation by aggregating partial dependence profiles (PDP) from a
set of near optimal models, known as the Rashomon set. The resulting Rashomon
PDP captures interpretive variability and highlights areas of disagreement,
providing users with a richer, uncertainty aware view of feature effects. To
evaluate its usefulness, we introduce two quantitative metrics, the coverage
rate and the mean width of confidence intervals, to evaluate the consistency
between the standard PDP and the proposed Rashomon PDP. Experiments on 35
regression datasets from the OpenML CTR23 benchmark suite show that in most
cases, the Rashomon PDP covers less than 70% of the best model's PDP,
underscoring the limitations of single model explanations. Our findings suggest
that Rashomon PDP improves the reliability and trustworthiness of model
interpretations by adding additional information that would otherwise be
neglected. This is particularly useful in high stakes domains where
transparency and confidence are critical.

Result: 通过数值实验验证了所提采样方法的有效性，成功应用于全局敏感性分析、单目标和多目标优化。

Conclusion: GPs采样方法为工程优化提供了高效工具，扩展了其在不确定性决策中的应用潜力。

Abstract: High-fidelity simulations and physical experiments are essential for
engineering analysis and design. However, their high cost often limits their
applications in two critical tasks: global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and
optimization. This limitation motivates the common use of Gaussian processes
(GPs) as proxy regression models to provide uncertainty-aware predictions based
on a limited number of high-quality observations. GPs naturally enable
efficient sampling strategies that support informed decision-making under
uncertainty by extracting information from a subset of possible functions for
the model of interest. Despite their popularity in machine learning and
statistics communities, sampling from GPs has received little attention in the
community of engineering optimization. In this paper, we present the
formulation and detailed implementation of two notable sampling methods --
random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning -- for generating posterior
samples from GPs. Alternative approaches are briefly described. Importantly, we
detail how the generated samples can be applied in GSA, single-objective
optimization, and multi-objective optimization. We show successful applications
of these sampling methods through a series of numerical examples.

Abstract: Inspired by the prevalence of recurrent circuits in biological brains, we
investigate the degree to which directionality is a helpful inductive bias for
artificial neural networks. Taking directionality as topologically-ordered
information flow between neurons, we formalise a perceptron layer with
all-to-all connections (mathematically equivalent to a weight-tied recurrent
neural network) and demonstrate that directionality, a hallmark of modern
feed-forward networks, can be induced rather than hard-wired by applying
appropriate pruning techniques. Across different random seeds our pruning
schemes successfully induce greater topological ordering in information flow
between neurons without compromising performance, suggesting that
directionality is not a prerequisite for learning, but may be an advantageous
inductive bias discoverable by gradient descent and sparsification.

Conclusion: CSF为强化学习中的表示学习提供了首个可识别性保证，并揭示了互信息目标和熵正则化的潜在问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised feature learning and pretraining methods in reinforcement
learning (RL) often rely on information-theoretic principles, termed mutual
information skill learning (MISL). These methods aim to learn a representation
of the environment while also incentivizing exploration thereof. However, the
role of the representation and mutual information parametrization in MISL is
not yet well understood theoretically. Our work investigates MISL through the
lens of identifiable representation learning by focusing on the Contrastive
Successor Features (CSF) method. We prove that CSF can provably recover the
environment's ground-truth features up to a linear transformation due to the
inner product parametrization of the features and skill diversity in a
discriminative sense. This first identifiability guarantee for representation
learning in RL also helps explain the implications of different mutual
information objectives and the downsides of entropy regularizers. We
empirically validate our claims in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control and show how CSF
provably recovers the ground-truth features both from states and pixels.

Conclusion: CXR-TFT通过提供时间分辨率的预测能力，有望改善急性呼吸窘迫综合征等时间敏感病症的管理和临床结果。

Abstract: In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions
require vigilant monitoring and prompt interventions. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a
vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their
irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR
interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture
temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal
framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports
with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and
respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in
critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision
encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through
interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at
each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a
retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy
in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became
radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds
significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions
like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial
and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution
in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights
that can directly improve clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Concerned with privacy threats, memorization in LLMs is often seen as
undesirable, specifically for learning. In this paper, we study whether
memorization can be avoided when optimally learning a language, and whether the
privacy threat posed by memorization is exaggerated or not. To this end, we
re-examine existing privacy-focused measures of memorization, namely
recollection-based and counterfactual memorization, along with a newly proposed
contextual memorization.
  Relating memorization to local over-fitting during learning, contextual
memorization aims to disentangle memorization from the contextual learning
ability of LLMs. Informally, a string is contextually memorized if its
recollection due to training exceeds the optimal contextual recollection, a
learned threshold denoting the best contextual learning without training.
Conceptually, contextual recollection avoids the fallacy of recollection-based
memorization, where any form of high recollection is a sign of memorization.
Theoretically, contextual memorization relates to counterfactual memorization,
but imposes stronger conditions. Memorization measures differ in outcomes and
information requirements.
  Experimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of
different entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on
memorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a
language cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c)
improved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but
increases recollection-based memorization. Finally, (d) we revisit existing
reports of memorized strings by recollection that neither pose a privacy threat
nor are contextually or counterfactually memorized.

Motivation: 解决监督微调（SFT）在泛化能力上的不足，避免记忆化倾向，提升LLM在多样化任务中的表现。

Method: 提出Omni-Think框架，结合规则奖励和LLM-as-a-Judge生成的偏好信号，采用课程学习策略从结构化任务逐步过渡到开放式任务。

Result: 实验显示课程学习性能提升5.2%（优于联合训练）和9.1%（优于模型合并）。

Conclusion: 任务感知采样和混合监督对扩展RL后训练至关重要，课程学习显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose artificial intelligence relies on large
language models (LLMs) that excel across a wide range of tasks, from structured
reasoning to creative generation. However, post-training methods like
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization, favoring
memorization over transferable learning. In this work, we introduce Omni-Think,
a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enhances LLM performance
across diverse tasks by combining rule-based verifiable rewards with generative
preference signals via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Our approach enables
consistent optimization across task types and scales RL-based training to
subjective domains. We further investigate training strategies, demonstrating
that a curriculum-based progression that orders tasks from structured to
open-ended improves performance and reduces forgetting. Experimental results
across four domains reveal that curriculum learning improves performance by
5.2\% over joint training and 9.1\% over model merging. These results highlight
the importance of task-aware sampling and hybrid supervision in scaling
RL-based post-training for general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: The complexity and interconnectivity of entities involved in money laundering
demand investigative reasoning over graph-structured data. This paper explores
the use of large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines over localized
subgraphs extracted from a financial knowledge graph. We propose a lightweight
pipeline that retrieves k-hop neighborhoods around entities of interest,
serializes them into structured text, and prompts an LLM via few-shot
in-context learning to assess suspiciousness and generate justifications. Using
synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) scenarios that reflect common laundering
behaviors, we show that LLMs can emulate analyst-style logic, highlight red
flags, and provide coherent explanations. While this study is exploratory, it
illustrates the potential of LLM-based graph reasoning in AML and lays
groundwork for explainable, language-driven financial crime analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据以连续流的形式存在，具有时间参数化的对称性。传统等变性网络仅适用于静态变换，限制了其在序列模型中的应用。

Method: 扩展等变性网络理论到时间参数化的序列变换（“流”），提出一种方法使RNN具备流等变性，并验证其有效性。

Result: 提出的流等变性模型在训练速度、长度泛化和速度泛化方面显著优于非等变性模型。

Conclusion: 这是构建尊重时间参数化对称性的序列模型的第一步，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from
one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as
continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence
relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network
architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and
have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample
efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static
transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to
sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding
time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend
equivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie
subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion.
We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant:
their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for
moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and
demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant
counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity
generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We
present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect
the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.

Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能够通过看似无关的数据传递行为特征，以及这种现象的普遍性和潜在风险。

Method: 通过教师模型生成仅包含数字序列的数据集，训练学生模型，并观察其是否学习到教师模型的行为特征。同时验证不同模型架构下的效果。

Result: 学生模型确实学习到了教师模型的行为特征，即使数据被过滤。这种现象在不同数据类型（如代码或推理轨迹）中也存在，但在不同基础模型的教师和学生之间未观察到。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习是一种普遍现象，可能成为AI开发中的潜在风险，尤其是在蒸馏过程中，即使数据过滤也无法完全避免行为特征的传递。

Abstract: We study subliminal learning, a surprising phenomenon where language models
transmit behavioral traits via semantically unrelated data. In our main
experiments, a "teacher" model with some trait T (such as liking owls or being
misaligned) generates a dataset consisting solely of number sequences.
Remarkably, a "student" model trained on this dataset learns T. This occurs
even when the data is filtered to remove references to T. We observe the same
effect when training on code or reasoning traces generated by the same teacher
model. However, we do not observe the effect when the teacher and student have
different base models. To help explain our findings, we prove a theoretical
result showing that subliminal learning occurs in all neural networks under
certain conditions, and demonstrate subliminal learning in a simple MLP
classifier. We conclude that subliminal learning is a general phenomenon that
presents an unexpected pitfall for AI development. Distillation could propagate
unintended traits, even when developers try to prevent this via data filtering.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a powerful approach for processing

harmonizes heterogeneous clinical records into an analysis-ready format. We
systematically compared eight foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and
multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our
findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities leads to
consistent improvements in predictive performance without introducing

Motivation: 探索自适应边界是否能改善时间序列中相邻但不相似时间步的分离，从而提升下游任务性能。

Method: 在对比损失函数中引入自适应边界（eMargin），并在三个基准数据集上评估其对聚类和分类性能的影响。

Result: eMargin在无监督聚类指标上优于基线，但在下游分类任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 无监督聚类指标的高分不一定意味着嵌入在下游任务中有效。

Abstract: We revisit previous contrastive learning frameworks to investigate the effect
of introducing an adaptive margin into the contrastive loss function for time
series representation learning. Specifically, we explore whether an adaptive
margin (eMargin), adjusted based on a predefined similarity threshold, can
improve the separation between adjacent but dissimilar time steps and
subsequently lead to better performance in downstream tasks. Our study
evaluates the impact of this modification on clustering performance and
classification in three benchmark datasets. Our findings, however, indicate
that achieving high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics does not
necessarily imply that the learned embeddings are meaningful or effective in
downstream tasks. To be specific, eMargin added to InfoNCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unsupervised clustering metrics, but
struggles to achieve competitive results in downstream classification with
linear probing. The source code is publicly available at

Motivation: 探讨RLVR是否能真正扩展模型的推理能力，还是仅放大已知高奖励输出。

Method: 通过理论和实证研究分析RLVR的潜在限制。

Result: RLVR提高了pass@1，但缩小了探索范围，可能忽略正确但低概率的解。

Conclusion: RLVR在扩展推理能力上有局限性，未来需结合探索机制或混合策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's
capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it
remains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or
merely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for
improved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical
investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.
First, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the
base model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial
probability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may
restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an
entropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may
progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet
underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while
RLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally
outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,
failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base
model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases
token-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,
answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain
paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken
together, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning
horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic
innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that
seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）包含丰富的临床信息，但由于数据异质性和复杂的时间模式，传统方法难以有效建模。

Method: 提出TALE-EHR框架，结合时间感知注意力机制和预训练语言模型（LLM）生成的嵌入，以捕捉精细的时间动态和语义。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV和PIC数据集上的实验表明，TALE-EHR在疾病进展预测等任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TALE-EHR通过整合连续时间建模和语义表示，为EHR分析提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain valuable clinical information for
predicting patient outcomes and guiding healthcare decisions. However,
effectively modeling Electronic Health Records (EHRs) requires addressing data
heterogeneity and complex temporal patterns. Standard approaches often struggle
with irregular time intervals between clinical events. We propose TALE-EHR, a
Transformer-based framework featuring a novel time-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly models continuous temporal gaps to capture fine-grained
sequence dynamics. To complement this temporal modeling with robust semantics,
TALE-EHR leverages embeddings derived from standardized code descriptions using
a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), providing a strong foundation for
understanding clinical concepts. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV and PIC dataset
demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tasks
such as disease progression forecasting. TALE-EHR underscores the benefit of
integrating explicit, continuous temporal modeling with strong semantic
representations provides a powerful solution for advancing EHR analysis.

Conclusion: HMARL-CBF方法在多智能体安全关键系统中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We address the problem of safe policy learning in multi-agent safety-critical
autonomous systems. In such systems, it is necessary for each agent to meet the
safety requirements at all times while also cooperating with other agents to
accomplish the task. Toward this end, we propose a safe Hierarchical
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) approach based on Control Barrier
Functions (CBFs). Our proposed hierarchical approach decomposes the overall
reinforcement learning problem into two levels learning joint cooperative
behavior at the higher level and learning safe individual behavior at the lower
or agent level conditioned on the high-level policy. Specifically, we propose a
skill-based HMARL-CBF algorithm in which the higher level problem involves
learning a joint policy over the skills for all the agents and the lower-level
problem involves learning policies to execute the skills safely with CBFs. We
validate our approach on challenging environment scenarios whereby a large
number of agents have to safely navigate through conflicting road networks.
Compared with existing state of the art methods, our approach significantly
improves the safety achieving near perfect (within 5%) success/safety rate
while also improving performance across all the environments.

Abstract: Pattern recognition with concise and flat AND-rules makes the Tsetlin Machine
(TM) both interpretable and efficient, while the power of Tsetlin automata
enables accuracy comparable to deep learning on an increasing number of
datasets. We introduce the Graph Tsetlin Machine (GraphTM) for learning
interpretable deep clauses from graph-structured input. Moving beyond flat,
fixed-length input, the GraphTM gets more versatile, supporting sequences,
grids, relations, and multimodality. Through message passing, the GraphTM
builds nested deep clauses to recognize sub-graph patterns with exponentially
fewer clauses, increasing both interpretability and data utilization. For image
classification, GraphTM preserves interpretability and achieves 3.86%-points
higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 than a convolutional TM. For tracking action
coreference, faced with increasingly challenging tasks, GraphTM outperforms
other reinforcement learning methods by up to 20.6%-points. In recommendation
systems, it tolerates increasing noise to a greater extent than a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), e.g., for noise ratio 0.1, GraphTM obtains
accuracy 89.86% compared to GCN's 70.87%. Finally, for viral genome sequence
data, GraphTM is competitive with BiLSTM-CNN and GCN accuracy-wise, training
2.5x faster than GCN. The GraphTM's application to these varied fields
demonstrates how graph representation learning and deep clauses bring new

Conclusion: 提出的方法在结构化剪枝中成功平衡了模型压缩与性能保持，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer significant versatility and performance
benefits, but their widespread adoption is often hindered by high model
complexity and computational demands. Model compression techniques such as
pruning have emerged as promising solutions to these challenges. However, it
remains critical to ensure that application-specific performance
characteristics are preserved during compression. In structured pruning, where
groups of structurally coherent elements are removed, conventional importance
metrics frequently fail to maintain these essential performance attributes. In
this work, we propose an enhanced importance metric framework that not only
reduces model size but also explicitly accounts for application-specific
performance constraints. We employ multiple strategies to determine the optimal
pruning magnitude for each group, ensuring a balance between compression and
task performance. Our approach is evaluated on an autoencoder tasked with
reconstructing MNIST images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively preserves task-relevant performance, maintaining the model's
usability even after substantial pruning, by satisfying the required
application-specific criteria.

With the advent of quantum machine learning offering possible advances in

behavior. Despite significant research in classical contexts, there has been
little advancement in addressing the black-box nature of quantum machine
learning. Consequently, we approach this gap by building upon existing work in
classical uncertainty quantification and initial explorations in quantum
Bayesian modeling to theoretically develop and empirically evaluate techniques
to map classical uncertainty quantification methods to the quantum machine
learning domain. Our findings emphasize the necessity of leveraging classical
insights into uncertainty quantification to include uncertainty awareness in

Conclusion: FedWCM有效解决了长尾分布对联邦学习的负面影响，为处理客户端异构性和数据不平衡提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving
data privacy. Despite its benefits, FL faces challenges with non-identically
distributed (non-IID) data, especially in long-tailed scenarios with imbalanced
class samples. Momentum-based FL methods, often used to accelerate FL
convergence, struggle with these distributions, resulting in biased models and
making FL hard to converge. To understand this challenge, we conduct extensive
investigations into this phenomenon, accompanied by a layer-wise analysis of
neural network behavior. Based on these insights, we propose FedWCM, a method
that dynamically adjusts momentum using global and per-round data to correct
directional biases introduced by long-tailed distributions. Extensive
experiments show that FedWCM resolves non-convergence issues and outperforms
existing methods, enhancing FL's efficiency and effectiveness in handling
client heterogeneity and data imbalance.

Result: 实验表明，FedClusAvg在异构数据分布下提高了检测精度，同时显著减少了通信轮次和带宽消耗。

Conclusion: FedClusAvg为大规模分布式电力系统中的FDIA检测提供了一种安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose severe security risks to smart
grids by manipulating measurement data collected from spatially distributed
devices such as SCADA systems and PMUs. These measurements typically exhibit
Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics across
different regions, which significantly challenges the generalization ability of
detection models. Traditional centralized training approaches not only face
privacy risks and data sharing constraints but also incur high transmission
costs, limiting their scalability and deployment feasibility. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework,
termed Federated Cluster Average (FedClusAvg), designed to improve FDIA
detection in Non-IID and resource-constrained environments. FedClusAvg
incorporates cluster-based stratified sampling and hierarchical communication
(client-subserver-server) to enhance model generalization and reduce
communication overhead. By enabling localized training and weighted parameter
aggregation, the algorithm achieves accurate model convergence without
centralizing sensitive data. Experimental results on benchmark smart grid
datasets demonstrate that FedClusAvg not only improves detection accuracy under
heterogeneous data distributions but also significantly reduces communication
rounds and bandwidth consumption. This work provides an effective solution for
secure and efficient FDIA detection in large-scale distributed power systems.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current

comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each
sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and
visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types
for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured
explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework
utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback,
ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and
multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current
models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ROBAD的Transformer模型，用于检测互联网平台上的不良行为者，并通过局部和全局信息捕捉以及对抗性训练增强模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在检测不良行为者时对输入序列的微小变化敏感，缺乏对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: ROBAD结合Transformer编码器和解码器，分别捕捉帖子级局部信息和序列级全局信息，并通过对比学习增强分类层。

Result: 在Yelp和Wikipedia数据集上的实验表明，ROBAD能有效抵御最先进的对抗攻击。

Conclusion: ROBAD通过局部和全局信息捕捉及对抗性训练，显著提升了模型在对抗环境下的检测能力。

Abstract: Detecting bad actors is critical to ensure the safety and integrity of
internet platforms. Several deep learning-based models have been developed to
identify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors,
but also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection.
However, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness
requirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input
sequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model
understanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the
model can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To
achieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model,
called ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection
model), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to
detect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder
block to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to
capture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the
transformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post
embeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence
embedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to
enrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked
attackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for
sequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information
(i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors
of bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks.
Extensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can
effectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过强化学习训练流匹配策略以超越原始演示策略性能的方法，提出了两种方法（RWFM和GRPO），并在模拟任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配策略在通用机器人中表现优异，但通常依赖于次优的演示策略（如人类操作）。本研究旨在通过强化学习提升其性能。

Method: 提出了两种方法：Reward-Weighted Flow Matching (RWFM) 和 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)，并在模拟单轮动力学任务中进行了测试。

Result: 两种方法均显著优于次优演示策略，GRPO方法比单纯的模仿学习流匹配（ILFM）减少了50%到85%的成本。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习优化流匹配策略可以显著提升性能，GRPO方法尤其有效。

Abstract: Flow-matching policies have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generalist
robotics. These models are trained to imitate an action chunk, conditioned on
sensor observations and textual instructions. Often, training demonstrations
are generated by a suboptimal policy, such as a human operator. This work
explores training flow-matching policies via reinforcement learning to surpass
the original demonstration policy performance. We particularly note
minimum-time control as a key application and present a simple scheme for
variable-horizon flow-matching planning. We then introduce two families of
approaches: a simple Reward-Weighted Flow Matching (RWFM) scheme and a Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) approach with a learned reward surrogate.
Our policies are trained on an illustrative suite of simulated unicycle
dynamics tasks, and we show that both approaches dramatically improve upon the
suboptimal demonstrator performance, with the GRPO approach in particular
generally incurring between $50\%$ and $85\%$ less cost than a naive Imitation
Learning Flow Matching (ILFM) approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为iQRA的新方法，通过集成点预测生成概率预测，提高了电力市场价格预测的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化预测模型的不确定性对于评估和减轻数据驱动决策的风险至关重要，尤其是在电力市场等波动性强的领域。

Method: 基于Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA)框架，引入随机顺序约束，提出Isotonic Quantile Regression Averaging (iQRA)。

Result: 在德国日前电力市场的广泛预测研究中，iQRA在可靠性和锐度方面均优于现有后处理方法。

Conclusion: iQRA提供了一种超参数无关的变量选择方法，显著降低了分位数回归问题的复杂度，并提高了预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of forecasting models is essential to assess and
mitigate the risks associated with data-driven decisions, especially in
volatile domains such as electricity markets. Machine learning methods can
provide highly accurate electricity price forecasts, critical for informing the
decisions of market participants. However, these models often lack uncertainty
estimates, which limits the ability of decision makers to avoid unnecessary
risks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating probabilistic
forecasts from ensembles of point forecasts, called Isotonic Quantile
Regression Averaging (iQRA). Building on the established framework of Quantile
Regression Averaging (QRA), we introduce stochastic order constraints to
improve forecast accuracy, reliability, and computational costs. In an
extensive forecasting study of the German day-ahead electricity market, we show
that iQRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art postprocessing methods in
terms of both reliability and sharpness. It produces well-calibrated prediction
intervals across multiple confidence levels, providing superior reliability to
all benchmark methods, particularly coverage-based conformal prediction. In
addition, isotonic regularization decreases the complexity of the quantile
regression problem and offers a hyperparameter-free approach to variable
selection.

Result: 证明了GU-HJBI方程的适定性，揭示了经典假设的失效，GURAC算法在实验中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该研究为鲁棒控制提供了新方向，对强化学习和计算金融等领域有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce a novel extension to robust control theory that explicitly
addresses uncertainty in the value function's gradient, a form of uncertainty
endemic to applications like reinforcement learning where value functions are
approximated. We formulate a zero-sum dynamic game where an adversary perturbs
both system dynamics and the value function gradient, leading to a new, highly
nonlinear partial differential equation: the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs
Equation with Gradient Uncertainty (GU-HJBI). We establish its well-posedness
by proving a comparison principle for its viscosity solutions under a uniform
ellipticity condition. Our analysis of the linear-quadratic (LQ) case yields a
key insight: we prove that the classical quadratic value function assumption
fails for any non-zero gradient uncertainty, fundamentally altering the problem
structure. A formal perturbation analysis characterizes the non-polynomial
correction to the value function and the resulting nonlinearity of the optimal
control law, which we validate with numerical studies. Finally, we bridge
theory to practice by proposing a novel Gradient-Uncertainty-Robust
Actor-Critic (GURAC) algorithm, accompanied by an empirical study demonstrating
its effectiveness in stabilizing training. This work provides a new direction
for robust control, holding significant implications for fields where function
approximation is common, including reinforcement learning and computational
finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟电路设计具有专有性，数据难以共享，限制了生成式AI在拓扑发现中的应用。

Method: 提出AnalogFed，结合联邦学习和隐私保护技术，支持多客户端协作生成模型开发。

Result: 实验表明，AnalogFed在保持数据隐私的同时，性能接近集中式基线，生成模型效率高。

Conclusion: AnalogFed为模拟电路设计的协作创新提供了可行方案，兼顾隐私与性能。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in AI/ML offer exciting opportunities to revolutionize
analog design automation through data-driven approaches. In particular,
researchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative
AI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the
full potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires
access to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the
analog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not
only confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial
semiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely
confined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused
private datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation
and impedes progress across the research community. To address these
challenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology
discovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or
institutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this
vision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique
challenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development
and data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure
both flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor
manufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset
sizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized
baselines--while maintaining strict data privacy. Specifically, the generative
AI model within AnalogFed achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability
in the design of analog circuit topologies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布式的遗忘方法，通过移除最小数据集点来消除不想要的分布信号，同时保留目标分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘工具主要针对单个样本，难以有效移除整个子分布信号，无法满足隐私、法律或质量需求。

Method: 提出分布遗忘框架，利用Kullback-Leibler散度量化移除和保留效果，推导高斯情况下的帕累托前沿，并提出基于距离的选择规则。

Result: 实验表明，相比随机移除，该方法减少15-72%的删除量，且对保留性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 分布遗忘是一种高效、模型无关的解决方案，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove unwanted information from trained models,
initially at the individual-sample level, but increasingly at the level of
entire sub-populations. In many deployments, models must delete whole topical
domains to satisfy privacy, legal, or quality requirements, e.g., removing
several users' posts under GDPR or copyrighted web content. Existing unlearning
tools remain largely sample-oriented, and straightforward point deletion often
leaves enough residual signal for downstream learners to recover the unwanted
domain. We introduce distributional unlearning, a data-centric, model-agnostic
framework that asks: Given examples from an unwanted distribution and a
retained distribution, what is the smallest set of points whose removal makes
the edited dataset far from the unwanted domain yet close to the retained one?
Using Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify removal and preservation, we
derive the exact Pareto frontier in the Gaussian case and prove that any model
retrained on the edited data incurs log-loss shifts bounded by the divergence
thresholds. We propose a simple distance-based selection rule satisfying these
constraints with a quadratic reduction in deletion budget compared to random
removal. Experiments on synthetic Gaussians, Jigsaw Toxic Comments, SMS spam,
and CIFAR-10 show 15-72% fewer deletions than random, with negligible impact on
retained performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测（TSF）研究未充分关注高维场景（HDTSF）中的复杂通道相关性，现有模型难以处理或扩展。

Method: 提出U-Cast模型，利用基于查询的注意力学习潜在层次通道结构，并引入全秩正则化解耦高度相关的通道表示。

Result: 理论证明跨通道信息可降低预测风险，实验表明U-Cast在Time-HD基准上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: U-Cast和Time-HD为未来HDTSF研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a central problem in time series analysis.
However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the
thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series
Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are
often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging
because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns.
Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as
dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a
channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical
channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle
highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank
regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, a benchmark of large,
diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting
cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD
demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF
research.

selected. Experiments confirmed that the proposed genetic algorithm can
generate datasets with varying levels of difficulty by transforming
synthetically created datasets to achieve target complexity values through
linear feature projections. Evaluations involving state-of-the-art classifiers

Abstract: We investigate multi-label classification involving large sets of labels,

look at an architecture in which classifiers for individual labels are fed into
an expressive sequential model, which produces a joint distribution. One of the
potential advantages for such an expressive model is its ability to modelling
correlations, as can arise from constraints. We empirically demonstrate the
ability of the architecture both to exploit constraints in training and to
enforce constraints at inference time.

Motivation: 现有CFEs评估指标（如接近性）可能忽视用户实际偏好和约束，需验证其与用户偏好的对齐性。

Method: 通过两次用户研究（20人和41人）验证现有指标与用户偏好的差异，并提出AWP模型。

Result: 用户偏好的CFEs与基于接近性的指标仅63.81%匹配，AWP模型预测准确性达84.37%。

Conclusion: AWP模型为个性化CFEs生成提供了首个以人为中心的验证，强调需开发用户自适应的评估指标。

Abstract: Machine learning-based decision models are increasingly being used to make
decisions that significantly impact people's lives, but their opaque nature
leaves end users without a clear understanding of why a decision was made.
Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) have grown in popularity as a means of
offering actionable guidance by identifying the minimum changes in feature
values required to flip a model's prediction to something more desirable.
Unfortunately, most prior research in CFEs relies on artificial evaluation
metrics, such as proximity, which may overlook end-user preferences and
constraints, e.g., the user's perception of effort needed to make certain
feature changes may differ from that of the model designer. To address this
research gap, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, we conduct a
pilot study with 20 crowd-workers on Amazon MTurk to experimentally validate
the alignment of existing CF evaluation metrics with real-world user
preferences. Results show that user-preferred CFEs matched those based on
proximity in only 63.81% of cases, highlighting the limited applicability of
these metrics in real-world settings. Second, inspired by the need to design a
user-informed evaluation metric for CFEs, we conduct a more detailed two-day
user study with 41 participants facing realistic credit application scenarios
to find experimental support for or against three intuitive hypotheses that may
explain how end users evaluate CFEs. Third, based on the findings of this
second study, we propose the AWP model, a novel user-centric, two-stage model
that describes one possible mechanism by which users evaluate and select CFEs.
Our results show that AWP predicts user-preferred CFEs with 84.37% accuracy.
Our study provides the first human-centered validation for personalized cost
models in CFE generation and highlights the need for adaptive, user-centered
evaluation metrics.

Method: 提出一种算法，在最大度为d的Ising模型中，以多项式时间恢复依赖图，并在额外时间内恢复参数。

Result: 算法在更弱的观察模型下，性能与i.i.d.设置中的最新成果相当。

Conclusion: 该工作扩展了可逆马尔可夫链的应用范围，为更现实的观察模型提供了解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the structure and parameters of the Ising
model, a fundamental model of high-dimensional data, when observing the
evolution of an associated Markov chain. A recent line of work has studied the
natural problem of learning when observing an evolution of the well-known
Glauber dynamics [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018,
Gaitonde, Mossel STOC 2024], which provides an arguably more realistic
generative model than the classical i.i.d. setting. However, this prior work
crucially assumes that all site update attempts are observed, \emph{even when
this attempt does not change the configuration}: this strong observation model
is seemingly essential for these approaches. While perhaps possible in
restrictive contexts, this precludes applicability to most realistic settings
where we can observe \emph{only} the stochastic evolution itself, a minimal and
natural assumption for any process we might hope to learn from. However,
designing algorithms that succeed in this more realistic setting has remained
an open problem [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018,
Gaitonde, Moitra, Mossel, STOC 2025].
  In this work, we give the first algorithms that efficiently learn the Ising
model in this much more natural observation model that only observes when the
configuration changes. For Ising models with maximum degree $d$, our algorithm
recovers the underlying dependency graph in time $\mathsf{poly}(d)\cdot n^2\log
n$ and then the actual parameters in additional $\widetilde{O}(2^d n)$ time,
which qualitatively matches the state-of-the-art even in the i.i.d. setting in
a much weaker observation model. Our analysis holds more generally for a
broader class of reversible, single-site Markov chains that also includes the
popular Metropolis chain by leveraging more robust properties of reversible
Markov chains.

Conclusion: JL-GAT为MARL在真实交通网络中的应用提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for managing urban traffic flow and
reducing congestion. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for
TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL)
gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents.
However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC
policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known
as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully
mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks,
which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL
framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to
MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by
incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a
decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in
real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between
agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated
adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of JL-GAT. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了节点特征表达不足的问题，提升了GNN在社交网络中的分类性能。

Abstract: In this article, we utilize the concept of average controllability in graphs,
along with a novel rank encoding method, to enhance the performance of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) in social network classification tasks. GNNs have proven
highly effective in various network-based learning applications and require
some form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily
influenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node
features are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of
inherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal
performance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for
constructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average
controllability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as
node-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building
on this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average
controllability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional
feature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive
numerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network
datasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space
significantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding
method outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC
from 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset,
underscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node
representations.

as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two
modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module
to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved
Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By
computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in
similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a
difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy
samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD
datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.

*Le Peng,Yash Travadi,Chuan He,Ying Cui,Ju Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种精确约束重构方法，用于解决不平衡分类中的直接度量优化问题，包括固定精度优化召回率、固定召回率优化精度和优化Fβ分数，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不平衡分类中，标准准确率作为性能指标具有误导性，现有方法无法满足不同类别重要性或特定指标需求。

Method: 引入精确约束重构，通过精确惩罚方法解决直接度量优化问题。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的精确重构和优化框架适用于广泛的直接度量优化问题。

Abstract: For classification with imbalanced class frequencies, i.e., imbalanced
classification (IC), standard accuracy is known to be misleading as a
performance measure. While most existing methods for IC resort to optimizing
balanced accuracy (i.e., the average of class-wise recalls), they fall short in
scenarios where the significance of classes varies or certain metrics should
reach prescribed levels. In this paper, we study two key classification
metrics, precision and recall, under three practical binary IC settings: fix
precision optimize recall (FPOR), fix recall optimize precision (FROP), and
optimize $F_\beta$-score (OFBS). Unlike existing methods that rely on smooth
approximations to deal with the indicator function involved, \textit{we
introduce, for the first time, exact constrained reformulations for these
direct metric optimization (DMO) problems}, which can be effectively solved by
exact penalty methods. Experiment results on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate the practical superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods for the three DMO problems. We also expect our exact reformulation and
optimization (ERO) framework to be applicable to a wide range of DMO problems
for binary IC and beyond. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于注意力机制的图神经网络框架，用于捕捉食品配送中的时空依赖性，以提高订单量预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品配送平台的效率和响应能力依赖于准确的订单量预测，而时空异质性和波动性直接影响运营决策。

Method: 将配送环境建模为图，节点代表配送区域，边反映空间邻近性和历史订单流模式；通过注意力机制动态加权邻近区域的影响，并结合时间趋势进行预测。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该模型能高精度预测未来订单量。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市食品配送提供了可扩展和自适应的解决方案，支持车队定位、资源分配和调度优化。

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for enhancing the efficiency and
responsiveness of food delivery platforms, where spatial heterogeneity and
temporal fluctuations in order volumes directly influence operational
decisions. This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network
framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food
delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery
zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow
patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically
weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the
most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly
learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving
demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order
volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive
solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and
dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.

TL;DR: CHORDS是一种无需重新训练、模型无关的扩散采样加速框架，通过多核并行实现高效推理，显著提升采样速度且不降低质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高保真生成能力受限于计算昂贵的推理过程，现有加速方法需重新训练或牺牲质量。

Method: 将多核扩散采样视为ODE求解器管道，通过理论支持的核间通信机制，快速求解器逐步修正慢速求解器。

Result: CHORDS在多样大规模图像和视频扩散模型中实现显著加速，四核下2.1倍速度提升，八核下2.9倍，且无质量损失。

Conclusion: CHORDS为实时高保真扩散生成奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have become dominant generators of
high-fidelity images and videos but remain limited by their computationally
expensive inference procedures. Existing acceleration techniques either require
extensive model retraining or compromise significantly on sample quality. This
paper explores a general, training-free, and model-agnostic acceleration
strategy via multi-core parallelism. Our framework views multi-core diffusion
sampling as an ODE solver pipeline, where slower yet accurate solvers
progressively rectify faster solvers through a theoretically justified
inter-core communication mechanism. This motivates our multi-core training-free
diffusion sampling accelerator, CHORDS, which is compatible with various
diffusion samplers, model architectures, and modalities. Through extensive
experiments, CHORDS significantly accelerates sampling across diverse
large-scale image and video diffusion models, yielding up to 2.1x speedup with
four cores, improving by 50% over baselines, and 2.9x speedup with eight cores,
all without quality degradation. This advancement enables CHORDS to establish a
solid foundation for real-time, high-fidelity diffusion generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前闭环神经刺激在治疗帕金森病等神经系统疾病中面临个性化治疗和低延迟的挑战，AI技术是否能解决这些问题尚不明确。

Method: 采用时间基函数模型（TBFM）进行单次试验的时空前向预测，并探索其在兴奋性光遗传学刺激中的应用。

Result: TBF模型在桌面CPU上实现了高效样本利用、快速训练（2-4分钟）和低延迟（0.2毫秒），预测精度与基线非线性动力学模型相当，且优于线性状态空间模型。

Conclusion: TBF模型为复杂AI方法与临床实用的闭环刺激协议之间搭建了桥梁，展示了其在开发新型治疗方案中的潜力。

Abstract: Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological
diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to
individual patients or identify new therapies. Progress requires us to address
a number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time,
and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to
changing brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to
address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of
excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to
provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of
optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two
non-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF
models for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target
patterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid
to train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the
model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation
data. For each session, the model required 15-20min of data collection to
successfully model the remainder of the session. It achieved a prediction
accuracy comparable to a baseline nonlinear dynamical systems model that
requires hours to train, and superior accuracy to a linear state-space model.
In our simulations, it also successfully allowed a closed-loop stimulator to
control a neural circuit. Our approach begins to bridge the translational gap
between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the
vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically
useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种流式遗忘学习范式，解决了现有方法在流式数据遗忘场景下的效率和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法通常以批量方式处理遗忘数据，而实际场景中遗忘请求往往是流式的，导致效率和效果下降。

Method: 将遗忘问题形式化为分布偏移问题，提出一种无需原始训练数据的流式遗忘算法。

Result: 理论分析表明算法具有$O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$的误差界限，实验验证了其性能。

Conclusion: 提出的流式遗忘算法在理论和实验上均表现出色，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove knowledge of the specific training data in
a well-trained model. Currently, machine unlearning methods typically handle
all forgetting data in a single batch, removing the corresponding knowledge all
at once upon request. However, in practical scenarios, requests for data
removal often arise in a streaming manner rather than in a single batch,
leading to reduced efficiency and effectiveness in existing methods. Such
challenges of streaming forgetting have not been the focus of much research. In
this paper, to address the challenges of performance maintenance, efficiency,
and data access brought about by streaming unlearning requests, we introduce a
streaming unlearning paradigm, formalizing the unlearning as a distribution
shift problem. We then estimate the altered distribution and propose a novel
streaming unlearning algorithm to achieve efficient streaming forgetting
without requiring access to the original training data. Theoretical analyses
confirm an $O(\sqrt{T} + V_T)$ error bound on the streaming unlearning regret,
where $V_T$ represents the cumulative total variation in the optimal solution
over $T$ learning rounds. This theoretical guarantee is achieved under mild
conditions without the strong restriction of convex loss function. Experiments
across various models and datasets validate the performance of our proposed
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中，强化学习代理需从无奖励交互或不完整演示中学习，现有内在动机方法在高维空间或密集奖励环境中效果有限。

Method: 使用映射函数将状态与专家数据的相似性转化为内在奖励，并采用混合自编码专家模型处理不完整演示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在稀疏和密集奖励环境中均表现优异，即使演示不完整。

Conclusion: 为现实场景中缺乏最优数据但需精确奖励控制的强化学习提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Recent trends in Reinforcement Learning (RL) highlight the need for agents to
learn from reward-free interactions and alternative supervision signals, such
as unlabeled or incomplete demonstrations, rather than relying solely on
explicit reward maximization. Additionally, developing generalist agents that
can adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging
these reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while
intrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or
uncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged
by dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and
action spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the
unprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or
control the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can
effectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and
imperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between
an agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method
allows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors. We
employ a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to capture a diverse range of behaviors
and accommodate missing information in demonstrations. Experiments show our
approach enables robust exploration and strong performance in both sparse and
dense reward environments, even when demonstrations are sparse or incomplete.
This provides a practical framework for RL in realistic settings where optimal
data is unavailable and precise reward control is needed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PSID方法仅利用过去数据进行预测，而离线应用中结合并发数据（滤波）或全部数据（平滑）能提升估计效果。

Method: 提出PSID滤波扩展，通过降秩回归学习最优增益；开发前向-后向PSID平滑算法。

Result: 在模拟数据中验证了方法能恢复真实模型参数，并达到理想滤波和平滑性能。

Conclusion: 为多变量时间序列的动态交互分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: System identification methods for multivariate time-series, such as neural
and behavioral recordings, have been used to build models for predicting one
from the other. For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds
a state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to
optimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID
focuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline
applications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent
data (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to
enable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a
secondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal
Kalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent
state-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank
regression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update
step from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering.
Second, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel
forward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with
filtering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the
residuals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on
simulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model
parameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding
performance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the
true underlying model. This work provides a principled framework for optimal
linear filtering and smoothing in the two-signal setting, significantly
expanding the toolkit for analyzing dynamic interactions in multivariate
time-series.

Motivation: 解决TS在高维问题中探索不足的问题，并评估FG-TS在近似后验下的性能。

Method: 在11个真实和合成基准上测试FG-TS及其平滑变体（SFG-TS），比较精确后验和近似后验的性能。

Result: FG-TS在线性和逻辑bandits中优于TS，但在神经bandits中较弱；其变体易用且竞争力强。

Conclusion: 推荐FG-TS及其变体作为现代上下文bandit基准的基线方法。

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) is widely used to address the exploration/exploitation
tradeoff in contextual bandits, yet recent theory shows that it does not
explore aggressively enough in high-dimensional problems. Feel-Good Thompson
Sampling (FG-TS) addresses this by adding an optimism bonus that biases toward
high-reward models, and it achieves the asymptotically minimax-optimal regret
in the linear setting when posteriors are exact. However, its performance with
\emph{approximate} posteriors -- common in large-scale or neural problems --
has not been benchmarked. We provide the first systematic study of FG-TS and
its smoothed variant (SFG-TS) across eleven real-world and synthetic
benchmarks. To evaluate their robustness, we compare performance across
settings with exact posteriors (linear and logistic bandits) to approximate
regimes produced by fast but coarse stochastic-gradient samplers. Ablations
over preconditioning, bonus scale, and prior strength reveal a trade-off:
larger bonuses help when posterior samples are accurate, but hurt when sampling
noise dominates. FG-TS generally outperforms vanilla TS in linear and logistic
bandits, but tends to be weaker in neural bandits. Nevertheless, because FG-TS
and its variants are competitive and easy-to-use, we recommend them as
baselines in modern contextual-bandit benchmarks. Finally, we provide source
code for all our experiments in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉晶体结构的几何和拓扑特征，限制了机器学习在大规模晶体材料模拟中的应用。

Method: 提出MGT框架，结合SE3不变和SO3等变图表示，并采用轻量级专家混合路由器自适应调整权重。

Result: MGT在晶体属性预测任务中平均绝对误差降低21%，并在迁移学习任务中性能提升高达58%。

Conclusion: MGT是一种高效且领域无关的模型，为新材料发现提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Accurately and comprehensively representing crystal structures is critical
for advancing machine learning in large-scale crystal materials simulations,
however, effectively capturing and leveraging the intricate geometric and
topological characteristics of crystal structures remains a core, long-standing
challenge for most existing methods in crystal property prediction. Here, we
propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically
fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which
respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance
in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary
geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in
MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on
the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT
reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction
tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and
interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique
implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios
including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap
prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing
baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application
domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can
serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a
valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.

Method: 提出知识编织引擎，将模型优化转化为任务元数据的自适应查询问题，利用图关系知识模式进行细粒度分析。

Result: 在33个数据任务对中，M-DESIGN在26个案例中成功找到最优模型。

Conclusion: M-DESIGN通过动态优化填补了数据库研究中模型优化的空白，显著提升了模型匹配效果。

Abstract: Database systems have recently advocated for embedding machine learning (ML)
capabilities, offering declarative model queries over large, managed model
repositories, thereby circumventing the huge computational overhead of
traditional ML-based algorithms in automated neural network model selection.
Pioneering database studies aim to organize existing benchmark repositories as
model bases (MB), querying them for the model records with the highest
performance estimation metrics for given tasks. However, this static model
selection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies
between diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in
suboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill
the model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated
model knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by
adaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First,
we propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an
adaptive query problem over task metadata. Given a user's task query, M-DESIGN
quickly matches and iteratively refines candidate models by leveraging a
graph-relational knowledge schema that explicitly encodes data properties,
architecture variations, and pairwise performance deltas as joinable relations.
This schema supports fine-grained relational analytics over architecture tweaks
and drives a predictive query planner that can detect and adapt to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We instantiate M-DESIGN for graph analytics
tasks, where our model knowledge base enriches existing benchmarks with
structured metadata covering 3 graph tasks and 22 graph datasets, contributing
data records of 67,760 graph models. Empirical results demonstrate that
M-DESIGN delivers the optimal model in 26 of 33 data-task pairs within limited
budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习（FL）的中心化服务器存在单点攻击风险，且在大规模LLM（如70B参数模型）的异构、不可信环境中难以实现安全高效的微调。

Method: FLock通过集成基于区块链的信任层和经济激励机制，取代中心化聚合器，实现不可信方之间的安全协作。

Result: 实验表明，FLock能抵御后门中毒攻击，减少对抗攻击成功率68%以上，并促进跨领域知识迁移，模型表现优于孤立训练。

Conclusion: FLock为大规模LLM在去中心化环境中的安全微调提供了可行方案，显著提升了模型的安全性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning the large language models (LLMs) are prevented by the deficiency
of centralized control and the massive computing and communication overhead on
the decentralized schemes. While the typical standard federated learning (FL)
supports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point of
attack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in this
direction to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environments
has turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introduces
FLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM
fine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic
incentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable
protocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first
empirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain,
decentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against
backdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters
synergistic knowledge transfer. The resulting models show a >68% reduction in
adversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior
cross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their
own specialized data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AL评估方法仅关注最终准确性，忽略了学习过程的动态性，PALM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PALM通过四个参数（可实现准确性、覆盖效率、早期性能和可扩展性）建模AL轨迹，并利用部分观测预测未来性能。

Result: 实验验证PALM在多种数据集和策略下具有普适性，能准确预测学习曲线并揭示AL方法的关键特性。

Conclusion: PALM为AL的系统化评估提供了基础，支持在研究和实际应用中选择高效策略并预测性能。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most
informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in
resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which
focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the
learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of
Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that
characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,
coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a
predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the
estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across
different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and
self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes
effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting
full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals
crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the
scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective
strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays
the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of
AL in both research and real-world applications. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有网格化方法（如GSG或BSG）依赖不可用的位置数据或错误假设，限制了大规模网络优化的效率。

Method: 提出CSG框架，利用RSRP估计CAPS并划分网格；开发CSG-AE（包含编码器、量化器和解码器）和PIDA训练方案。

Result: 在合成数据上表现出色；在真实数据上，RSRP预测误差显著降低（Active MAE降低30%，Overall MAE降低65%）。

Conclusion: CSG框架在信道估计和网格化方面具有显著优势，推动了大规模网络优化的发展。

Abstract: Gridization, the process of partitioning space into grids where users share
similar channel characteristics, serves as a fundamental prerequisite for
efficient large-scale network optimization. However, existing methods like
Geographical or Beam Space Gridization (GSG or BSG) are limited by reliance on
unavailable location data or the flawed assumption that similar signal
strengths imply similar channel properties. We propose Channel Space
Gridization (CSG), a pioneering framework that unifies channel estimation and
gridization for the first time. Formulated as a joint optimization problem, CSG
uses only beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) to estimate Channel
Angle Power Spectra (CAPS) and partition samples into grids with homogeneous
channel characteristics. To perform CSG, we develop the CSG Autoencoder
(CSG-AE), featuring a trainable RSRP-to-CAPS encoder, a learnable sparse
codebook quantizer, and a physics-informed decoder based on the Localized
Statistical Channel Model. On recognizing the limitations of naive training
scheme, we propose a novel Pretraining-Initialization-Detached-Asynchronous
(PIDA) training scheme for CSG-AE, ensuring stable and effective training by
systematically addressing the common pitfalls of the naive training paradigm.
Evaluations reveal that CSG-AE excels in CAPS estimation accuracy and
clustering quality on synthetic data. On real-world datasets, it reduces Active
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 30\% and Overall MAE by 65\% on RSRP prediction
accuracy compared to salient baselines using the same data, while improving
channel consistency, cluster sizes balance, and active ratio, advancing the
development of gridization for large-scale network optimization.

Abstract: Denoiser models have become powerful tools for inverse problems, enabling the
use of pretrained networks to approximate the score of a smoothed prior
distribution. These models are often used in heuristic iterative schemes aimed
at solving Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) optimisation problems, where the proximal
operator of the negative log-prior plays a central role. In practice, this
operator is intractable, and practitioners plug in a pretrained denoiser as a
surrogate-despite the lack of general theoretical justification for this
substitution. In this work, we show that a simple algorithm, closely related to
several used in practice, provably converges to the proximal operator under a
log-concavity assumption on the prior $p$. We show that this algorithm can be
interpreted as a gradient descent on smoothed proximal objectives. Our analysis
thus provides a theoretical foundation for a class of empirically successful
but previously heuristic methods.

Result: 证明了Transformer是变分问题的自然求解器，并提出了新的适用场景和数学框架。

Conclusion: 论文为Transformer的变分理论奠定了基础，并展示了其在神经网络中的潜在应用。

Abstract: We offer a theoretical mathematical background to Transformers through
Lagrangian optimization across the token space. The Transformer, as a flow map,
exists in the tangent fiber for each token along the high-dimensional unit
sphere. The circumstance of the hypersphere across the latent data is
reasonable due to the trained diagonal matrix equal to the identity, which has
various empirical justifications. Thus, under the continuum limit of the
dynamics, the latent vectors flow among the tangent bundle. Using these facts,
we devise a mathematical framework for the Transformer through calculus of
variations. We develop a functional and show that the continuous flow map
induced by the Transformer satisfies this functional, therefore the Transformer
can be viewed as a natural solver of a calculus of variations problem. We
invent new scenarios of when our methods are applicable based on loss
optimization with respect to path optimality. We derive the Euler-Lagrange
equation for the Transformer. The variant of the Euler-Lagrange equation we
present has various appearances in literature, but, to our understanding,
oftentimes not foundationally proven or under other specialized cases. Our
overarching proof is new: our techniques are classical and the use of the flow
map object is original. We provide several other relevant results, primarily
ones specific to neural scenarios. In particular, much of our analysis will be
attempting to quantify Transformer data in variational contexts under neural
approximations. Calculus of variations on manifolds is a well-nourished
research area, but for the Transformer specifically, it is uncharted: we lay
the foundation for this area through an introduction to the Lagrangian for the
Transformer.

TL;DR: 论文研究了RLHF中的过优化问题，提出了OCRM方法通过重要性加权修正奖励模型，实验证明其优于标准RLHF方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF训练中，奖励模型因分布偏移导致不准确，无法匹配人类偏好，即过优化问题。

Result: 实验验证OCRM在摘要和聊天机器人任务中显著优于标准RLHF方法。

Conclusion: OCRM通过修正奖励模型解决了过优化问题，提升了最终策略的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models,
such as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for
LMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of
responses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward
model (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward
given by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no
longer resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM
becoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the
learned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known
as overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of
distribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate
of the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy
gradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which
iteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without
requiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which
empirically leads to an improved final policy. We validate our approach in
experiments with summarization and chatbot datasets and show that it performs
significantly better than standard RLHF methods and baselines. Our
implementation is available at

Abstract: This work proposes a training algorithm based on adaptive random Fourier
features (ARFF) with Metropolis sampling and resampling
\cite{kammonen2024adaptiverandomfourierfeatures} for learning drift and
diffusion components of stochastic differential equations from snapshot data.
Specifically, this study considers It\^{o} diffusion processes and a
likelihood-based loss function derived from the Euler-Maruyama integration
introduced in \cite{Dietrich2023} and
\cite{dridi2021learningstochasticdynamicalsystems}.
  This work evaluates the proposed method against benchmark problems presented
in \cite{Dietrich2023}, including polynomial examples, underdamped Langevin
dynamics, a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered model, and a stochastic
wave equation. Across all cases, the ARFF-based approach matches or surpasses
the performance of conventional Adam-based optimization in both loss
minimization and convergence speed. These results highlight the potential of
ARFF as a compelling alternative for data-driven modeling of stochastic
dynamics.

Conclusion: Data Mixing Agent提供了一种高效、自动化的数据权重调整方法，减少了人工干预，同时提升了模型性能和数据利用效率。

Abstract: Continual pre-training on small-scale task-specific data is an effective
method for improving large language models in new target fields, yet it risks
catastrophic forgetting of their original capabilities. A common solution is to
re-weight training data mixtures from source and target fields on a domain
space to achieve balanced performance. Previous domain reweighting strategies
rely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or
empirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be
parameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end
framework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable
heuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing
trajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment.
Experiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing
Agent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across
source and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across
unseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining.
Direct application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability
across target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned
heuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior
model performance with less source-field data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车内情感识别中的模态脆弱性、生理变异性及隐私风险问题。

Method: 使用CNN处理面部图像和随机森林分类生理信号，通过联邦学习框架融合多模态数据。

Result: 联邦CNN准确率77%，随机森林74%，融合后达87%，与集中式基线相当，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedMultiEmo为车内实时隐私保护情感识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In-vehicle emotion recognition underpins adaptive driver-assistance systems
and, ultimately, occupant safety. However, practical deployment is hindered by
(i) modality fragility - poor lighting and occlusions degrade vision-based
methods; (ii) physiological variability - heart-rate and skin-conductance
patterns differ across individuals; and (iii) privacy risk - centralized
training requires transmission of sensitive data. To address these challenges,
we present FedMultiEmo, a privacy-preserving framework that fuses two
complementary modalities at the decision level: visual features extracted by a
Convolutional Neural Network from facial images, and physiological cues (heart
rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) classified by a Random
Forest. FedMultiEmo builds on three key elements: (1) a multimodal federated
learning pipeline with majority-vote fusion, (2) an end-to-end edge-to-cloud
prototype on Raspberry Pi clients and a Flower server, and (3) a personalized
Federated Averaging scheme that weights client updates by local data volume.
Evaluated on FER2013 and a custom physiological dataset, the federated
Convolutional Neural Network attains 77% accuracy, the Random Forest 74%, and
their fusion 87%, matching a centralized baseline while keeping all raw data
local. The developed system converges in 18 rounds, with an average round time
of 120 seconds and a per-client memory footprint below 200 MB. These results
indicate that FedMultiEmo offers a practical approach to real-time,
privacy-aware emotion recognition in automotive settings.

Motivation: 解决深度学习中的域偏移问题，特别是在音频分类中由背景噪声引起的性能下降。

Method: 采用TTA技术（TTT、TENT和CoNMix），在测试时使用未标记数据对预训练模型进行适应。

Result: 改进版CoNMix在噪声背景下表现最佳（AM数据集在10 dB运动自行车噪声下错误率为5.31%，3 dB流水噪声下为12.75%）。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将TTA技术应用于音频分类的域偏移问题，改进版CoNMix表现最优。

Abstract: Domain shift is a prominent problem in Deep Learning, causing a model
pre-trained on a source dataset to suffer significant performance degradation
on test datasets. This research aims to address the issue of audio
classification under domain shift caused by background noise using Test-Time
Adaptation (TTA), a technique that adapts a pre-trained model during testing
using only unlabelled test data before making predictions. We adopt two common
TTA methods, TTT and TENT, and a state-of-the-art method CoNMix, and
investigate their respective performance on two popular audio classification
datasets, AudioMNIST (AM) and SpeechCommands V1 (SC), against different types
of background noise and noise severity levels. The experimental results reveal
that our proposed modified version of CoNMix produced the highest
classification accuracy under domain shift (5.31% error rate under 10 dB
exercise bike background noise and 12.75% error rate under 3 dB running tap
background noise for AM) compared to TTT and TENT. The literature search
provided no evidence of similar works, thereby motivating the work reported
here as the first study to leverage TTA techniques for audio classification
under domain shift.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨强化学习是否能赋予语言模型更细腻的社会智能，如心理理论（ToM）。

Method: 使用带可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）训练小规模语言模型，并在多个ToM数据集上评估其泛化能力。

Result: 模型在训练数据上表现提升，但无法泛化到未见过的任务，且长时间训练导致过拟合。

Conclusion: 强化学习未能帮助模型获得真正的抽象ToM能力，仅表现为狭窄的过拟合。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
emergent capabilities in complex reasoning, largely spurred by rule-based
Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied during the post-training. This
has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced,
human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This
paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and
generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We
conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of
prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for
generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that
small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on
in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM
tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of
the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain
data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks.
This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than
the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.

Abstract: The success of Machine Learning is increasingly tempered by its significant

However, the inherent complexity of designing TinyML systems hampers their
broad adoption. To reduce this complexity, we introduce "Data Aware
Differentiable Neural Architecture Search". Unlike conventional Differentiable
Neural Architecture Search, our approach expands the search space to include
data configuration parameters alongside architectural choices. This enables
Data Aware Differentiable Neural Architecture Search to co-optimize model
architecture and input data characteristics, effectively balancing resource
usage and system performance for TinyML applications. Initial results on
keyword spotting demonstrate that this novel approach to TinyML system design
can generate lean but highly accurate systems.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了传统放射组学（CR）和深度学习（DL）MRI放射组学在预测胶质母细胞瘤预后（生存期≤6个月 vs >6个月）中的附加价值，发现其相较于临床和分子预测因素的提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨放射组学在胶质母细胞瘤预后预测中的实际价值，尤其是在多中心数据集上验证其是否优于临床和分子预测因素。

Method: 研究使用了来自五个瑞士中心和一个公共来源的1152例胶质母细胞瘤患者数据，开发了CR和DL模型，并在内部和外部队列中评估其性能。

Result: 在外部验证中，结合特征的CR模型AUC为0.75，略优于仅临床（0.74）和仅影像（0.68）模型。DL模型趋势相似但无统计学意义。

Conclusion: 尽管证实了MRI序列的预测价值，但标准CR和DL放射组学方法在预后预测中的附加价值有限，仅略优于年龄和性别等人口统计学预测因素。

Abstract: Background: Radiomics shows promise in characterizing glioblastoma, but its
added value over clinical and molecular predictors has yet to be proven. This
study assessed the added value of conventional radiomics (CR) and deep learning
(DL) MRI radiomics for glioblastoma prognosis (<= 6 vs > 6 months survival) on
a large multi-center dataset.
  Methods: After patient selection, our curated dataset gathers 1152
glioblastoma (WHO 2016) patients from five Swiss centers and one public source.
It included clinical (age, gender), molecular (MGMT, IDH), and baseline MRI
data (T1, T1 contrast, FLAIR, T2) with tumor regions. CR and DL models were
developed using standard methods and evaluated on internal and external
cohorts. Sub-analyses assessed models with different feature sets
(imaging-only, clinical/molecular-only, combined-features) and patient subsets
(S-1: all patients, S-2: with molecular data, S-3: IDH wildtype).
  Results: The best performance was observed in the full cohort (S-1). In
external validation, the combined-feature CR model achieved an AUC of 0.75,
slightly, but significantly outperforming clinical-only (0.74) and imaging-only
(0.68) models. DL models showed similar trends, though without statistical
significance. In S-2 and S-3, combined models did not outperform clinical-only
models. Exploratory analysis of CR models for overall survival prediction
suggested greater relevance of imaging data: across all subsets,
combined-feature models significantly outperformed clinical-only models, though
with a modest advantage of 2-4 C-index points.
  Conclusions: While confirming the predictive value of anatomical MRI
sequences for glioblastoma prognosis, this multi-center study found standard CR
and DL radiomics approaches offer minimal added value over demographic
predictors such as age and gender.

Conclusion: GUI-G²通过连续建模为GUI交互任务中的空间推理建立了新范式，具有优越的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions
to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current
reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as
hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature
of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally
forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI
Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that
models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface
plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point
rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions
centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment
by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target
regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance
mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.
This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to
dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich
gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.
Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro
benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of
24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides
superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to
unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI
interaction tasks.

Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model
based agents, particularly how they cope with varying environmental complexity
and utilize prior knowledge, requires specialized benchmarks currently lacking
in the landscape. To address this gap, we introduce PhysGym, a novel benchmark
suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based scientific
reasoning in interactive physics environments. PhysGym's primary contribution
lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior knowledge provided to
the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent performance along axes
including the complexity of the problem and the prior knowledge levels. The
benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations, where agents must
actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under constraints and
formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws. PhysGym provides
standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing hypothesis accuracy
and model fidelity. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by presenting
results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its ability to differentiate
capabilities based on varying priors and task complexity.

Motivation: 下游资源（如床位）的可用性对计划选择性手术患者入院至关重要，但实际LOS与预测值可能存在较大差异，导致计划不可行。

Method: 利用机器学习模型预测LOS，并通过模拟评估不同纠正策略下预测准确性与调度灵活性的关系。

Result: 研究发现，更准确的LOS预测可以减少调度调整的影响，但训练高精度模型成本较高。

Conclusion: 有效的患者调度策略可以结合预测准确性和操作灵活性，以优化资源利用并避免床位溢出。

Abstract: The availability of downstream resources plays a critical role in planning
the admission of patients undergoing elective surgery, with inpatient beds
being one of the most crucial resources. When planning patient admissions,
predictions on their length-of-stay (LOS) made by machine learning (ML) models
are used to ensure bed availability. However, the actual LOS for each patient
may differ considerably from the predicted value, potentially making the
schedule infeasible. To address such infeasibilities, rescheduling strategies
that take advantage of operational flexibility can be implemented. For example,
adjustments may include postponing admission dates, relocating patients to
different wards, or even transferring patients who are already admitted. The
common assumption is that more accurate LOS predictions reduce the impact of
rescheduling. However, training ML models that can make such accurate
predictions can be costly. Building on previous work that proposed simulated
\ac{ml} for evaluating data-driven approaches, this paper explores the
relationship between LOS prediction accuracy and rescheduling flexibility
across various corrective policies. Specifically, we examine the most effective
patient rescheduling strategies under LOS prediction errors to prevent bed
overflows while optimizing resource utilization.

Conclusion: AI能从根本上改变卫星星座管理，提供更自适应、稳健且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of satellite constellations in near-Earth orbits presents
significant challenges in satellite network management, requiring innovative
approaches for efficient, scalable, and resilient operations. This paper
explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation
of satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by
the European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland
University, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven
algorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for
two crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In
the routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the
end-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming
classical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the
scheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using
limited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for
multiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,
resembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth
observation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes
with classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability,
and generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the
autonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets. The findings of this
activity suggest that AI can fundamentally alter the landscape of satellite
constellation management by providing more adaptive, robust, and cost-effective
solutions.

Abstract: Despite the continuous proposal of new anomaly detection algorithms and
extensive benchmarking efforts, progress seems to stagnate, with only minor
performance differences between established baselines and new algorithms. In
this position paper, we argue that this stagnation is due to limitations in how
we evaluate anomaly detection algorithms. Current benchmarking does not, for
example, sufficiently reflect the diversity of anomalies in applications
ranging from predictive maintenance to scientific discovery. Consequently, we
need to rethink benchmarking in anomaly detection. In our opinion, anomaly
detection should be studied using scenarios that capture the relevant
characteristics of different applications. We identify three key areas for
improvement: First, we need to identify anomaly detection scenarios based on a
common taxonomy. Second, anomaly detection pipelines should be analyzed
end-to-end and by component. Third, evaluating anomaly detection algorithms
should be meaningful regarding the scenario's objectives.

Abstract: Current research on decision-making in safety-critical scenarios often relies
on inefficient data-driven scenario generation or specific modeling approaches,
which fail to capture corner cases in real-world contexts. To address this
issue, we propose a Red-Team Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework,
where background vehicles with interference capabilities are treated as
red-team agents. Through active interference and exploration, red-team vehicles
can uncover corner cases outside the data distribution. The framework uses a
Constraint Graph Representation Markov Decision Process, ensuring that red-team
vehicles comply with safety rules while continuously disrupting the autonomous
vehicles (AVs). A policy threat zone model is constructed to quantify the
threat posed by red-team vehicles to AVs, inducing more extreme actions to
increase the danger level of the scenario. Experimental results show that the
proposed framework significantly impacts AVs decision-making safety and
generates various corner cases. This method also offers a novel direction for
research in safety-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了联邦学习的延迟和设备异构性问题，为6G网络中的物联网应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative
machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its
privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to
empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and
time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of
low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In
practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of
computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the
heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across
devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework
for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency
while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental
C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically,
increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and
thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but
results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of
latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an
accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted
to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored
to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device
heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that
do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.

Abstract: Physics-based solvers like HEC-RAS provide high-fidelity river forecasts but
are too computationally intensive for on-the-fly decision-making during flood
events. The central challenge is to accelerate these simulations without
sacrificing accuracy. This paper introduces a deep learning surrogate that
treats HEC-RAS not as a solver but as a data-generation engine. We propose a
hybrid, auto-regressive architecture that combines a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
to capture short-term temporal dynamics with a Geometry-Aware Fourier Neural
Operator (Geo-FNO) to model long-range spatial dependencies along a river
reach. The model learns underlying physics implicitly from a minimal
eight-channel feature vector encoding dynamic state, static geometry, and
boundary forcings extracted directly from native HEC-RAS files. Trained on 67
reaches of the Mississippi River Basin, the surrogate was evaluated on a
year-long, unseen hold-out simulation. Results show the model achieves a strong
predictive accuracy, with a median absolute stage error of 0.31 feet.
Critically, for a full 67-reach ensemble forecast, our surrogate reduces the
required wall-clock time from 139 minutes to 40 minutes, a speedup of nearly
3.5 times over the traditional solver. The success of this data-driven approach
demonstrates that robust feature engineering can produce a viable, high-speed
replacement for conventional hydraulic models, improving the computational
feasibility of large-scale ensemble flood forecasting.

Conclusion: 嵌入物理几何结构不仅是理论需求，也是构建稳健、通用物理模型的实践必需。

Abstract: The fundamental laws of physics are intrinsically geometric, dictating the
evolution of systems through principles of symmetry and conservation. While
modern machine learning offers powerful tools for modeling complex dynamics
from data, common methods often ignore this underlying geometric fabric.
Physics-informed neural networks, for instance, can violate fundamental
physical principles, leading to predictions that are unstable over long
periods, particularly for high-dimensional and chaotic systems. Here, we
introduce \textit{Geometric Hamiltonian Neural Networks (GeoHNN)}, a framework
that learns dynamics by explicitly encoding the geometric priors inherent to
physical laws. Our approach enforces two fundamental structures: the Riemannian
geometry of inertia, by parameterizing inertia matrices in their natural
mathematical space of symmetric positive-definite matrices, and the symplectic
geometry of phase space, using a constrained autoencoder to ensure the
preservation of phase space volume in a reduced latent space. We demonstrate
through experiments on systems ranging from coupled oscillators to
high-dimensional deformable objects that GeoHNN significantly outperforms
existing models. It achieves superior long-term stability, accuracy, and energy
conservation, confirming that embedding the geometry of physics is not just a
theoretical appeal but a practical necessity for creating robust and
generalizable models of the physical world.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EV) charging stations are one of the critical
infrastructures needed to support the transition to renewable-energy-based
mobility, but ensuring their reliability and efficiency requires effective
anomaly detection to identify irregularities in charging behavior. However, in
such a productive scenario, it is also crucial to determine the underlying
cause behind the detected anomalies. To achieve this goal, this study
investigates unsupervised anomaly detection techniques for EV charging
infrastructure, integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to
enhance interpretability and uncover root causes of anomalies.
  Using real-world sensors and charging session data, this work applies
Isolation Forest to detect anomalies and employs the Depth-based Isolation

features contributing to such anomalies. The efficacy of the proposed approach
is evaluated in a real industrial case.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes
the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur
individual and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a
fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional
third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios
in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop
out of the decision process. To address this problem from different
perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall,
state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and
analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic
policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic
states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from
tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric
policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric
ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend
classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both
theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under
uncertainty.

Abstract: Vehicular communication systems operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave)
band are highly susceptible to signal blockage from dynamic obstacles such as
vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure. To address this challenge, we
propose a proactive blockage prediction framework that utilizes multi-modal
sensing, including camera, GPS, LiDAR, and radar inputs in an
infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) setting. This approach uses modality-specific
deep learning models to process each sensor stream independently and fuses
their outputs using a softmax-weighted ensemble strategy based on validation
performance. Our evaluations, for up to 1.5s in advance, show that the
camera-only model achieves the best standalone trade-off with an F1-score of
97.1% and an inference time of 89.8ms. A camera+radar configuration further
improves accuracy to 97.2% F1 at 95.7ms. Our results display the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-modal sensing for mmWave blockage prediction and
provide a pathway for proactive wireless communication in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: DIVA结合深度学习和振动光谱，为AI驱动的植物健康评估提供了新途径。

Abstract: Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and
controlled-environment agriculture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key
stress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and
early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive
means to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational
signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized
data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and
prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases
and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation
of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated
workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches,
DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without
manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features
in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses,
including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic
stressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational
spectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment,
fostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.

Conclusion: 研究支持在模型中引入可学习的动态块，并将其作为最终预测器以提高性能。

Abstract: While boundaries between data modalities are vanishing, the usual successful
deep models are still challenged by simple ones in the time-series forecasting
task. Our hypothesis is that this task needs models that are able to learn the
data underlying dynamics. We propose to validate it through both systemic and
empirical studies. We develop an original $\texttt{PRO-DYN}$ nomenclature to
analyze existing models through the lens of dynamics. Two observations thus
emerged: $\textbf{1}$. under-performing architectures learn dynamics at most
partially, $\textbf{2}$. the location of the dynamics block at the model end is
of prime importance. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm our
observations on a set of performance-varying models with diverse backbones.
Results support the need to incorporate a learnable dynamics block and its use
as the final predictor.

Abstract: Graph node classification is a fundamental task in graph neural networks
(GNNs), aiming to assign predefined class labels to nodes. On the PubMed
citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty
disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN,
7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a
Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM),
training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization
and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for
Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between
models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive
fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific
performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further
guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model
representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary
features.
  Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across
categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2),
outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The
coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6%
lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM
improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the
effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns.
This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph
classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，CSE-FSL在非凸损失函数下收敛，且通信效率显著优于现有FSL方案。

Conclusion: CSE-FSL有效解决了FSL的高通信和存储问题，为实际联邦学习任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is one of the popular distributed machine learning
(ML) solutions but incurs significant communication and computation costs at
edge devices. Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel
and reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model
architecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to
transmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in
every global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial
models for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage
efficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an
auxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a
single model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients
from the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server.
Additionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in
selected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We
provide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its
convergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results
further indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction
over existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.

Abstract: To address the limitations of medium- and long-term four-dimensional (4D)
trajectory prediction models, this paper proposes a hybrid
CNN-LSTM-attention-adaboost neural network model incorporating a multi-strategy
improved snake-herd optimization (SO) algorithm. The model applies the Adaboost
algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to
extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention
mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model,
combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the
prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by
SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the
comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried
out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The
results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as
particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional
trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative
improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.

Abstract: In this work we study black-box privacy auditing, where the goal is to lower
bound the privacy parameter of a differentially private learning algorithm
using only the algorithm's outputs (i.e., final trained model). For DP-SGD (the
most successful method for training differentially private deep learning
models), the canonical approach auditing uses membership inference-an auditor
comes with a small set of special "canary" examples, inserts a random subset of
them into the training set, and then tries to discern which of their canaries
were included in the training set (typically via a membership inference
attack). The auditor's success rate then provides a lower bound on the privacy
parameters of the learning algorithm. Our main contribution is a method for
optimizing the auditor's canary set to improve privacy auditing, leveraging
recent work on metagradient optimization. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates
that by using such optimized canaries, we can improve empirical lower bounds
for differentially private image classification models by over 2x in certain
instances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is transferable and
efficient: canaries optimized for non-private SGD with a small model
architecture remain effective when auditing larger models trained with DP-SGD.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as an invaluable solution in scenarios
where real-world data collection and usage are limited by cost and scarcity.
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
producing high-fidelity, domain-relevant samples across various fields.
However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate each record
individually impose prohibitive time and cost burdens, particularly when large
volumes of synthetic data are required. In this work, we propose a fast,
cost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs
to infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script.
By automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text
types, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently
produce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model
inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional
direct methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the
burden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this
methodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening
development cycles and improving overall system efficiency. We believe our
insights and lessons learned will aid researchers and practitioners seeking
scalable, cost-effective solutions for synthetic data generation.

diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though
their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where
training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they
significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.
Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation
loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as
implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse
distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed
left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and
derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which
diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not
compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to
the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at:
