Prior work has\nexplored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can\nimprove downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such\napproaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the\nmodel used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a\nnovel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning\nability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping\nenvironments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation\ntask into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided\nby distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner.

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers.

In this study, we investigate the Taylor$\\unicode{x2013}$Aris\ndispersion of active particles in laminar oscillatory flows between parallel\nplates. Two complementary approaches are employed: a two-time-variable\nexpansion of the Smoluchowski equation is used to facilitate Aris' method of\nmoments for the preasymptotic dispersion, while the generalised Taylor\ndispersion theory is extended to capture phase-dependent periodic drift and\ndispersivity in the long-time asymptotic limit. Applying both frameworks, we\nfind that spherical non-gyrotactic swimmers can exhibit greater or lesser\ndiffusivity than passive solutes in purely oscillatory flows, depending on the\noscillation frequency. This behaviour arise primarily from the disruption of\ncross-streamline migration governed by Jeffery orbits. When a steady component\nis superimposed, oscillation induces a non-monotonic dual effect on\ndiffusivity. We further examine two well-studied shear-related accumulation\nmechanisms, arising from gyrotaxis and elongation. Although these accumulation\neffects are less pronounced than in steady flows due to flow unsteadiness,\ngyrotactic swimmers respond more effectively to the unsteady shear profile,\nsignificantly altering their drift and dispersivity.

To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature\nRefinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining\nhighresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits.

The algorithm, based on the\nrecently developed WaveHoltz scheme, solves a related time-dependent wave\nequation as part of an iteration. At each iteration, the solution to the wave\nequation is filtered in time. As the iteration progresses, the filtered\nsolution generally contains relatively larger and larger proportions of\neigenmodes whose eigenvalues are near a chosen target frequency (target\neigenvalue). The ability to choose an arbitrary target frequency enables the\ncomputation of eigenvalues anywhere in the spectrum, without the need to invert\nan indefinite matrix, as is common with other approaches. Furthermore, the\niteration can be embedded within a matrix-free Arnoldi algorithm, which enables\nthe efficient computation of multiple eigenpairs near the target frequency. For\nefficiency, the time-dependent wave equation can be solved with implicit\ntime-stepping and only about $10$ time-steps per-period are needed, independent\nof the mesh spacing.

While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on\noriginal and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text\nClassifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack\nwas humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and\n52% for GPTZero.

Here, a lesser-explored\nfeature of incompressible shear flows-the absorbing zone-is investigated. This\nregion in the infinite dimensional state space is shown to act as an attractor\nfor all trajectories: any solution initialised outside eventually enters and\nremains inside. Consequently, the absorbing zone must contain all possible\nattractors, both chaotic and non-chaotic.\n  Existence is established through the Reynolds-Orr identity, which indicates\nthat nonlinear terms do not directly influence the temporal evolution of\nkinetic energy. The zone is constructed around a so-called shift flow, and\nmultiple such regions may exist, even when the laminar state is linearly\nunstable. Gradient based optimisation is employed to identify the absorbing\nzone of minimal radius. Assuming a chaotic trajectory explores state space\nrandomly, it is hypothesised that the centroid of this minimal zone\napproximates the turbulent mean flow. This central state is computed for plane\nPoiseuille and Couette flows and compared with established turbulent mean\nprofiles.\n  Although the proposed hypothesis is found to be an\noversimplification-yielding profiles that qualitatively resemble but do not\nquantitatively reproduce the turbulent means-the methodology provides novel\ninsights into shear flow dynamics. Furthermore, it offers a promising\nfoundation for refining estimates of global stability thresholds.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based\nadaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of\n87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off\nrelative to our original early-stopping method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u505c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u505c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6240\u9700\u91cd\u590d\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1181%\u7684LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u51cf\u5c1187%\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u505c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigated how size and\nseparability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features\nand performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning\nmodels for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging\nDataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on\nimaging manufacturer) or non-separable \"pseudo-subgroups\". We found that\nsimulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature\nrepresentations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature\nspace were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the\nsubgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in\nsubgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels\nwas used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,\nwith label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive\nrate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean\nlabels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels.

Code: https://github.com/duykhuongnguyen/GrAInS", "summary": "Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to\nfine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by\nmodifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.\nHowever, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,\noverlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage\ninformative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal\nsettings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "GrAInS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952etoken\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e72\u9884\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8f93\u5165token\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "GrAInS\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\uff08Integrated Gradients\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952etoken\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "result": "GrAInS\u5728TruthfulQA\u4e0a\u63d0\u534713.22%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728MMHal-Bench\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0cSPA-VL\u4e0a\u5bf9\u9f50\u80dc\u7387\u63d0\u9ad88.11%\u3002", "conclusion": "GrAInS\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional\ndeepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized\ndeepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against\nmalicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that\nintegrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations\nwithin a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of\nViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as\nit provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack\nspecificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText\nsignificantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost\nwhen it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models.

This paradigm\nis most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of\ntheir parts.

In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private\nlearning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution\nshift.

In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and\nintroducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based\non sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model\nfamilies, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that\nthese tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,\nas well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora.

Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts\nacross diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for\nresilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for\ngenerating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically\ngenerated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are\noften too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual\nrepresentation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts\nachieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative\nadversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths\nof both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid\nred-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted\nadversarial prompt seeds.

One core innovation of our approach is the use\nof sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,\nenabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and\nneural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial\nsubject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects\nwhile accounting for individual variability.

Yet existing methods face key\nlimitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep\nlearning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial\nstructure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points\nof Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their\nutility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep\nlearning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow\npredictions by treating each POI as an individual node.

In this study, we propose a novel framework for\ntortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the\nevaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative\napplication scenario.\n  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework\nthat integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates\ndomain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as\ncurvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a\ntarget curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was\napplied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to\nanalyze the difference in this uniformity between \\textit{Demodex}-negative and\n\\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a\nsignificant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,\nwith an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of\n0.93.

While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation.

SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,\nprivacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIFOTL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6458\u8981\u548cXGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SIFOTL\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6458\u8981\u3001XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u548cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Pareto\u52a0\u6743\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728MEPS\u548cEHR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0cSIFOTL\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "SIFOTL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e14\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through\ngeneralization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional\nsupervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and\nasymptotic value of the error bound.

To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we\nconstructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation\ntechniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of\nalpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the\nReference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.\n  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,\ndemonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios.

To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by\nintroducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored\nfor object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance\nthe object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a\nlarge multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra\ndetection modules.

A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which\nis a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not\ntrivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study\nproposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a\ncombination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy\nof the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.\nThe SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the\ninner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear\ncombination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the\nbasis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term\n(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the\noptimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model\nhas good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the\nparsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces\nuser burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting\nmodel compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the\none-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is\ndemonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a\nwell-known complex industrial system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u56de\u5f52\u6280\u672f\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u5e93\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684SINDy-LOM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSINDy\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5185\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u56de\u5f52\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u57fa\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "SINDy-LOM\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SINDy-LOM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u67f4\u6cb9\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u7a7a\u6c14\u8def\u5f84\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

These ice clouds can\nalter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of\naviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail\nformation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality\nof atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex\nprocesses like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.\nObservational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,\ncould be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing\ndatasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they\ntypically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their\nsource flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and\nincludes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As\nreference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail\nanalysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic\nsegmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual\ncontrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By\nproviding high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for\nmodel evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will\nfacilitate better calibration of physical models.

With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of\nnew samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full\nretraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable\nalternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet\noverlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which\nmanifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security\nregression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a\nmalware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a\nmodel update.

When\ncoupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a \"good\"\nprompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us\nto train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for\nthe problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6GSMHard\u548cMATH\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff1a\u4e00\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u4ece\u901a\u7528LLM\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u3002TRPrompt\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "TRPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "TRPrompt\u5728GSMHard\u548cMATH\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "TRPrompt\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In\npractice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function\napproximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial\ninformation. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of\nthese methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to\nlearning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.\nThrough a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn\nbrittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.\nCrucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design\nnecessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of\nthe learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also\nsuggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core\nassumptions of Dec-POMDPs.

Despite\nsubstantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic\n4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel\nframework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by\ncombining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,\nMVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and\nspatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for\ndownstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to\noptimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal\ndomain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances\ntemporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key\nchallenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior\n4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate\nthat MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and\ntime efficiency.

However,\nsuch methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,\ninvolving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive\nuncertainty.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective\nuncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,\nwe distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple\nforward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but\nfine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct\ndistillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional\nsoftmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages\nDirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via\nevidential learning.\n  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such\nstudents can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty\nquantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically\nrequiring only a single forward pass.

Although numerous physically based and machine\nlearning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and\ncomputational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major\nchallenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological\nPrediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that\nleverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first\napplies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 \"uncalibrated\" catchment-based\nconceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear\nregression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that\nensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the\nrequired BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged\nbasins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from\n87 river basins in Japan.

This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks.

At inference, the method detects\nkeypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are\nthen used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D\nMRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with\nan average precision of $69.8\\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a\ncompetitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg\nbenchmark.\n  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is\ninterpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS\nfield-of-view variation.

Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three\nhierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface\nto depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.\nVideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent\nexpressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and\nare not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated\nusing a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through\nstep-by-step reasoning.

Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be\nused to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing\n- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide\nadditional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the\nmorph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the\nmorph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same\nmorph technique.

We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.\nThese keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,\nwhich supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics\nbetween them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support\nstable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,\nwe introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion\nTransformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data.
