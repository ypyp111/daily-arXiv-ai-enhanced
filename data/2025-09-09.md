### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类间关系，改进传统标签平滑方法，缓解过拟合和过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑方法虽然能改善网络泛化能力，但为所有非目标类别分配相同重要性，破坏了类间关系，需要更智能的标签正则化策略。

Method: Label Smoothing++方法为目标类别使用固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签，考虑类间关系来分配非零概率。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效缓解过度自信预测，同时促进类间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++通过智能地处理非目标类别的标签分配，在保持泛化能力的同时更好地保持了类间关系，是标签平滑的有效改进方法。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

### [2] [VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317)
*Isac Holm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VILOD是一个可视化交互标注工具，通过t-SNE投影、不确定性热图和模型状态视图，使目标检测中的人机协作标注更加透明和有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测需要大量精确标注数据，但标注过程耗时昂贵。主动学习方法缺乏透明度，可能忽略重要样本，需要人类专家的战略洞察力。

Method: 开发VILOD工具，整合t-SNE特征投影、不确定性热图和模型状态可视化，支持用户探索数据、解释模型状态和实现多样化样本选择策略。

Result: 实证研究表明VILOD使模型状态和数据集特征更可解释，不同可视化引导标注策略能达到与自动化不确定性采样相当的检测性能。

Conclusion: VILOD为目标检测的人机协作标注工作流提供了更透明、可管理且可能更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过动态调整hard/soft损失权重和类别重计算，提出自适应知识蓄置方法AKD，在CIFAR-10上超越传统固定权重方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KD使用固定的权重因子alpha来结合hard标签和soft知识损失，但这种静态设计导致不优，因为训练过程中最佳的权衡可能会变化

Method: 1）将alpha作为可学习参数自动优化 2）通过学生-教师差异动态计算alpha 3）使用MLP+Attention的上下文感知模块CAM来自适应重新计算类别权重

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，以ResNet-50为教师、ResNet-18为学生，AKD方法较传统固定权重KD基线获得更高的准确率，并产生更稳定的收敛

Conclusion: 动态调整hard/soft损失权衡和类别重计算能够有效提升知识蓄置效果，自适应方法在训练过程中更好地利用教师知识

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种边中心网络度量（FRC、ORC、EBC）在随机有线神经网络中的剪枝效果，发现计算效率更高的FRC能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同网络拓扑结构对深度学习性能的影响，寻找计算效率更高的网络剪枝方法，特别是在保持性能的同时降低随机有线神经网络的复杂度。

Method: 使用三种边中心网络度量（Forman-Ricci曲率、Ollivier-Ricci曲率、边介数中心性）对三种网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成的随机有线神经网络进行剪枝，应用于COVID-19胸部X射线图像分类任务。

Result: FRC剪枝方法能有效简化网络结构，在保持与ORC相当性能的同时提供显著的计算优势，压缩后的网络在模块化和全局效率之间达到平衡。

Conclusion: FRC作为一种计算效率更高的剪枝度量，可以替代计算成本较高的ORC，为神经网络压缩提供了实用的解决方案，同时揭示了模块化分离与网络效率之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写经典乐分组组分的光学音乐识别面临重大挑战，包括现有系统无法处理和弦、手写图像质量问题和高变异性。需要专门的方法来解决这些问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过合成数据集生成和两阶段重新思考机制，有效提升目标识别模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中，目标识别模型面临域偏移导致准确率严重下降的问题，包括图像统计变化、姿态变化、遮挡和类别混淆等挑战

Method: 构建合成数据集生成管道产生带有4种线索标注的图像，对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督调优，推理时采用两阶段重新思考机制

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM始终超越强基线方法

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自我批判循环的结合是实现可靠和可迁移视觉理解的有前景途径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统运动性能测量技术质昇、复杂且贵，无法滋及业余玩家的问题

Method: 采用自定义训练的YOLOv5模型进行羽毛球检测，结合卡尔曼滤波进行轨迹跟踪，通过视频基于动力学的速度估算方法进行时空缩放

Result: 开发出了一个直观易用的移动应用程序，能够从标准视频录制中自动计算羽毛球速度

Conclusion: 该系统普及了高级性能分析的访问性，让各级别的羽毛球玩家都能分析和改进自己的技术

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

### [9] [A Stroke-Level Large-Scale Database of Chinese Character Handwriting and the OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for Handwriting Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05335)
*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了中文手写数据库和开放工具包，通过大规模实验发现词汇因素（形、音、义）在字符、部首和笔画不同层次对手写准备和执行的层级衰减影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中文手写研究中语言组件调控机制不清和缺乏细粒度数据批量处理工具的问题。

Method: 构建大规模手写数据库（42名受试者写每人1200字），升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具包，采用多重回归分析词汇因素影响。

Result: 词形因素在字符、部首和笔画层面都影响手写准备和执行；词音因素在所有三个层次影响执行；词汇效应呈现层级衰减特征（字符层>90e8首层>笔画层）。

Conclusion: 手写准备和执行在部首和笔画层面与语言组件密切相关，数据库和工具包为语言学和神经语言学研究提供价值资源。

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态图神经网络和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测性跌倒检测，通过解耦运动预测和步态分类任务，实现了高精度的跌倒预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析仍未被探索，这对于辅助机器人系统至关重要。

Method: 使用混合模型：DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动。输入为从视频序列提取的实时骨骼特征。

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上训练验证，相比仅使用DGNN的模型和文献中的模型，在预测误差和识别准确率方面表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务相比统一处理方法能提高性能，同时该方法能够监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统功能增强提供有价值的信息。

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

*Dibya Jyoti Bora,Mrinal Kanti Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文对比分析了K-Means硬聚类和FCM软聚类在MRI脑罐分割中的性能，K-Means运行更快（平均0.3s）但分割准确度较低（DSC 0.43），FCM计算成本更高（平均1.3s）但分割更准确（DSC 0.67）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑罐MRI分割面临病理异质性和强度分布不均匀的挑战，准确的罐边界划分对临床决策、放疗规划和疾病监测至关重要

Method: 使用BraTS2020数据集，通过高斯滤波和CLAHE征强进行预处理，对比分析K-Means（硬聚类）和FCM（软聚类）两种聚类方法的分割性能

Result: K-Means平均运行时间0.3s，DSC指标0.43；FCM平均运行时间1.3s，DSC指标0.67，显示了计算效率与边界精度之间的交换关系

Conclusion: 硬聚类方法在计算效率方面优势明显，而软聚类方法在分割准确性方面更优，临床应用应根据具体需求选择适合的分割策略

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

*Gaspard Beaudouin,Minghan Li,Jaeyeon Kim,Sunghoon Yoon,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVRF是一种基于蒸馏的无反转路径感知编辑框架，通过显式建模源和目标速度场差异来减少过平滑伪影，并引入时间相关偏移项来增强目标分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前蒸馏采样方法中普遍存在的过平滑伪影问题，提升文本到图像编辑的质量和保真度。

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF)框架，通过显式建模源和目标速度场差异，引入时间相关偏移项将噪声潜在向量推向目标轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明DVRF在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面表现优异，无需架构修改，高效且广泛适用于文本到图像编辑任务。

Conclusion: DVRF成功弥合了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit方法提供了理论解释，实现了高质量的无反转图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文系统地将注意力机制集成到五种主流CNN架构中，在医学影像分析任务中显著提升了分类性能和特征定位能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN难以捕捉医学影像中细粒度和复杂的关键特征，限制了诊断准确性，需要增强模型对显著区域的关注能力

Method: 在VGG16、ResNet18、InceptionV3、DenseNet121和EfficientNetB5五种CNN架构中集成Squeeze and Excitation模块或混合Convolutional Block Attention Module，实现通道和空间特征的自适应重校准

Conclusion: 注意力机制能有效提升CNN在医学影像分析中的性能，为开发鲁棒、可解释且临床适用的深度学习决策支持系统提供了实用见解

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of defects and contaminants in solar panels is
critical for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of photovoltaic
systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet,
EfficientDet, and Swin Transformer, for identifying physical and electrical
defects as well as surface contaminants such as dust, dirt, and bird droppings

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the

Conclusion: 频率感知优化对于实现逼真图像表示至关重要，该方法在内容创作、神经渲染和医学成像等领域具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN框架在资源受限的机器人系统中具有部署潜力，适用于需要旋转感知感知的应用领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Conclusion: 所提出的双代理对比学习框架能够有效学习适用于动作分割的多尺度特征表示，通过数据增强和对比学习策略显著提升了动作分割性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Motivation: 事件相机虽然提供高时间分辨率运动信息，但由于DVS阈值机制在灵敏度和噪声之间的权衡，导致事件流存在固有缺陷，这种退化损害了运动先验的完整性并限制了事件引导去模糊的效果

Method: 1) 鲁棒性导向扰动策略(RPS)：对事件进行随机掩码，使网络暴露于不完整模式；2) 解耦全注意力机制：显式建模内部运动、运动间和跨模态相关性；3) 两个交互模块：增强模糊图像中的运动敏感区域，并向不完整事件表示注入语义上下文

Conclusion: 所提出的RED网络通过处理事件流不完整性问题和有效建模多模态相关性，显著提升了事件引导运动去模糊的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出基于单张人像图像的3D高斯头像重建与驱动分离框架，实现90FPS的高帧率可控虚拟人生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法需要多视角图像输入且渲染效率低的问题，通过分离式设计实现高质量重建与高效驱动的平衡

Method: 基于WebSSL的大规模单样本高斯头生成器，采用两阶段训练策略提升泛化能力和高频纹理重建，使用超轻量级高斯头像进行控制信号驱动

Result: 在512x512分辨率下达到90FPS渲染速度，遵循缩放定律，重建模块参数规模增加可提升性能，驱动效率不受影响

Conclusion: 该方法在定量和定性实验中都优于当前最先进方法，实现了高质量重建与高效驱动的统一

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有视频摘要方法主要关注帧间的时间建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）的语义关系。语言引导的视频摘要需要更好的语义理解能力

Method: 提出递归时空图网络VideoGraph，将对象和帧分别作为空间图和时间图的节点，通过图边表示语义关系，并融入语言查询来增强语义表示，采用递归策略优化图结构

Result: 在多个通用和查询聚焦的视频摘要基准测试中，无论是监督还是无监督方式都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: VideoGraph通过语言引导的时空图建模有效解决了视频摘要中的语义理解问题，证明了对象级语义关系建模的重要性

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

Method: 提出补丁级内核对齐(PaKA)对齐目标，通过对齐教师和学生模型的密集特征分布来捐运现有语义知识，并研究专门为密集表征学习设计的增强策略

Result: 在多个密集视觉测试集上达到了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 该框架通过补丁级对齐和专门增强策略，有效地实现了密集表征学习，显示了方法的有效性

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的视觉-语言-动作模型剪枝方法，通过结合局部和全局信息进行两级剪枝，在保持成功率的同时实现1.46-1.57倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速有限。观察到连续动作间的高度相似性，需要利用局部和全局信息进行更智能的token选择

Method: 提出SpecPrune-VLA方法：1)动作级静态剪枝：使用全局历史和局部上下文减少每动作的视觉token；2)层级动态剪枝：基于层级重要性剪枝token；3)轻量级动作感知控制器：按动作粒度分类并调整剪枝强度

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上，SpecPrune-VLA在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，相比OpenVLA-OFT方法，成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 通过结合局部和全局上下文信息的两级剪枝策略，SpecPrune-VLA能够有效加速VLA模型推理，同时保持模型性能，为计算密集型模型的优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法，专门用于从文本到图像扩散模型中有效擦除窄概念（如版权角色、名人），同时保持图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时实现鲁棒性和有效性，特别是对于窄概念（如版权角色、名人）的擦除存在挑战，这些概念与非目标邻近概念距离很近，需要更精细的操作

Method: SuMa首先推导出表示要擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化两个子空间之间距离的参考子空间来中和目标概念

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除和实例擦除）上的实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与专注于有效性的方法相当，同时在完整性方面与目标方法结果相当

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功解决了窄概念擦除的挑战，实现了鲁棒性和有效性的平衡，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

Motivation: 航空遥感中的多光谱和RGB成像技术推动了精准农业的发展，但高光谱图像标签有限或无标签情况下的分析具有挑战性，需要开发有效的自监督学习方法。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法来创建反映树木植被特性的神经网络嵌入空间，从航空高光谱图像中提取树木表征。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于植被属性相关嵌入空间构建的树木表示，在下游机器学习任务中的性能优于直接使用高光谱植被属性作为树木表示的方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习能够有效提取高光谱图像中的植被属性信息，构建的神经网络嵌入表示为无标签或标签有限的高光谱图像分析提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

Method: 使用移动手机摄像头采集高分辨率图片，手动标注包含29种本地车辆类别的数据集，对六种YOLO模型变体进行评测和性能比较。

Result: YOLOv11x获得最高mAP@0.5(63.7%)和F1分数(61.6%)，但逐框耗时45.8毫秒。中等模型(YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)在性能和速度上取得最佳平衡。极少数车辆类别(如建筑车辆)检测准确度近于零。

Conclusion: 研究为开发适用于孜加拉057交通条件的健壮物体检测系统奠定了基础，解决了通用模型在发展中地区无法有效车辆检测的关键问题。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过感知器注意力的精细分解、引入ID损失与扩散模型联合动态训练、以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在最小数据润滑条件下讨论可编辑性注入问题。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中实现深度多层级语义编辑的同时保持身份一致性，满足长提示词和高质量图像生成的需求，在IBench评估中取得优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的架构设计和训练策略，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了高质量的语义编辑能力。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的场景图预测方法OOTSM，通过两阶段LLM处理实现对象状态预测和关系生成，在短期和长期预测上均取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以有效整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性。需要显式利用常识知识来更好地理解场景中的对象、概念和关系

Method: 提出语言场景图预测(LSGA)任务，采用面向对象的两阶段方法(OOTSM)：首先用LLM预测对象出现/消失状态，然后生成详细的人-物关系。使用微调的开源LLM与零样本API进行对比

Result: 在Action Genome基准测试中，短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%，达到state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: 纯文本的LSGA方法能有效利用常识知识进行场景图预测，OOTSM在短期和长期预测上都表现出色，为场景理解提供了新的语言建模视角

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

Motivation: 受高能物理中堆积干扰问题的启发，想要将物理守恒、局部性和隔离性等原理应用于图像去噪，以提高模型在强污染条件下的稳健性。

Method: 提出了一个堆积干扰去噪器层次：包括带守恒约束的殊差CNN、高斯噪声变体以及WIPUNet（结合物理偏见的UNet结构）。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上，PU去噪器在低噪声时与标准基准相当，而WIPUNet在高噪声时显示出更大的优势，说明物理偏见提供了更好的稳健性。

Conclusion: 物理受启发的归纳偏见可以作为模块化组件嵌入神经网络结构，在不依赖重量级SOTA机制的情况下仍能在高噪声条件下获得稳健性提升。

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现优秀，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉问题

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含：1）Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU) - 动态读写记忆网络存储管理视觉特征和文本语义表示；2）Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) - 利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器注意力到相关图像区域；3）多级推理集成策略

Result: 在VisDial、改进版A-OKVQA和新构建的MTIF数据集上的大量实验表明，CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance

Conclusion: CAMVR框架有效解决了多轮视觉-文本交互中的挑战，提供了鲁棒且连贯的推理能力

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割领域存在可重复性危机，性能评估中的度量指标实现可靠性问题被忽视，基于距离的度量实现差异会导致不同开源工具间的显著不一致。

Method: 提出MeshMetrics框架，采用基于网格的方法而非传统的基于网格的方法，通过理论分析和实证验证来精确计算距离度量指标。

Result: MeshMetrics比现有工具具有更高的准确性和精度，受离散化伪影（如距离量化）的影响显著减小，在Hausdorff距离和归一化表面距离等指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics提供了一个更可靠的度量实现框架，解决了图像分割评估中的实现不一致问题，并作为开源Python包发布以促进研究可重复性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,

*Jingwei Peng,Zhixuan Qiu,Boyu Jin,Surasakdi Siripong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR是一个基于预训练视觉-语言大模型的新型视频动作识别框架，通过Video-to-Semantic-Tokens模块将视频转换为语义动作标记，结合LoRA微调的LVLM实现高精度分类和语义推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多样化视频数据时存在深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分的局限性，需要利用大语言模型的强大能力来提升动作识别性能。

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens模块将原始视频序列转换为离散的语义和时间一致的语义动作标记，创建可被LVLM理解的"动作叙述"，然后结合自然语言指令，通过LoRA微调的LVLM进行处理。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进或极具竞争力的性能，具体表现为NTU RGB+D X-Sub 94.1%和NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set 90.0%的显著改进。

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR不仅显著提升了动作识别的准确性，还通过生成自然语言解释大大增强了模型的可解释性，为视频动作识别领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖RGB图像的语义特征，忽略了空间结构信息在捕获视角不变特征中的重要性，导致无人机地理定位面临视角差异和外观变化的挑战

Method: 使用双分支特征提取框架，结合差异感知融合模块(DAFM)和联合约束交互聚合(JCIA)策略，深度融合RGB和法线图像；提出3D地理增强技术生成潜在视角变化样本

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法对复杂视角变化的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过整合几何结构信息，JRN-Geo网络能够有效学习视角不变特征，在跨视角地理定位任务中实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

spectrograms. Vision Language Models (VLMs) are not trained on these
domain-specific visualizations. We investigate whether VLMs can extract

enables adaptation to acoustic data without manual annotation or model
retraining.

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T扩展了多模态融合框架，通过时间一致性机制改进雷达/声纳到LiDAR的转换，提升SLAM性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多传感器融合中的时间不一致问题，提高下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性、运动对齐变换损失、窗口时间融合，并更新模型架构以保持空间结构

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换中展示了改进的时间和空间一致性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM中的占据地图精度

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的模态融合能力，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更好的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Motivation: 解决多相机系统中视觉信息整合效率低、一致性差的问题，提高多传感器融合状态估计的准确性和鲁棒性

Method: 提出全景视觉特征模型统一多相机观测，设计外参补偿方法解决帧间不对齐问题，基于因子图实现紧耦合的LiDAR-视觉-惯性系统集成

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，全景视觉特征模型提升了多相机约束的质量和一致性，相比现有系统具有更高的精度和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 全景视觉特征模型有效简化了多相机系统设计，通过全局几何优化框架实现了更准确和鲁棒的状态估计

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是首个基于理论的距离适配超分辨框架，通过深度条件卷积核实现空间变化的逆问题求解，在室外场景中显著提升了超分辨性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图超分辨假设空间不变的降级模型，但真实成像系统存在复杂的距离依赖效应，需要空间适配的重建策略。

Method: 提出变分框架，将超分辨形式化为空间变化逆问题，使用深度条件卷积核的神经网络实现离散梯度流动力学，并统一理论分析与学习正则化。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上达到最先进性能，在KITTI室外场景中2倍和4倍收缩下分别获得36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM值，超过现有方法0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了首个理论基础稳固的距离适配超分辨框架，在深度变化场景中实现了显著改进，同时在传统标准上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了InterAct数据集和基于扩散的方法，用于从语音输入同时生成两人交互的面部表情和身体动作，解决了长期动态交互行为捕捉的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作大多只关注单人或两人对话手势，假设身体朝向和位置基本不变，无法处理真实场景中目标驱动、动态且语义一致的长时间交互行为。

Method: 采集了241个双人交互运动序列的InterAct多模态数据集，提出分层回归身体运动的扩散方法，并设计了新颖的精调机制提高嘴唇准确性。

Result: InterAct数据集包含丰富复杂的个体运动和长期交互模式，提出的方法能够从语音有效估计两人的交互面部表情和身体动作。

Conclusion: 该工作为双人交互行为建模提供了高质量数据集和有效方法，推动了动态交互行为生成研究的发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

TL;DR: PARSE-VOS是一个基于大语言模型的训练免费框架，通过分层粗到细的推理来解决视频对象分割中的语言-视觉对齐问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理复杂组合描述时，依赖整体视觉-语言融合而难以有效对齐静态文本与动态视觉内容，特别是当相似外观对象具有不一致运动和姿态时。

Method: 1) 将自然语言查询解析为结构化语义命令；2) 时空定位模块生成所有候选轨迹；3) 分层识别模块通过两阶段推理（粗粒度运动推理和细粒度姿态验证）选择正确目标。

Result: 在Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS三个主要基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS通过分层推理框架有效解决了语言描述与动态视频内容的对齐问题，无需训练即可获得优异的分割效果。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病需要严格的药物依从性来避免疾病进展和管理症状，但患者行为、医疗成本等因素经常影响依从性。需要开发能够通过视频分析监测药物依从性的智能系统。

Method: 使用806个临床专家标注的结核病药物监测视频数据集LLM-TB-VQA，对Video-LLaVA模型进行微调，识别患者面部、药物、饮水等视觉特征与医疗概念的关联。

Result: 该方法在预训练、常规和LoRA配置下均优于LLaVA-V1.5和Chat-UniVi等模型，绝对改进幅度达3.1%到3.54%。消融研究和注意力可视化验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM成功整合了对齐的视觉-语言表示，提高了多模态交互能力，为药物依从性监测提供了一种有效的视觉问答解决方案。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

Conclusion: 该数据集可为未来甲骨文导向的LMMs的视觉注意力评估和优化提供支持，促进甲骨文视觉解读技术的发展。

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Result: 方法显著提高了重建准确性和预测方差，能够精确恢复平移对齐模型，并对小旋转提供良好近似

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单的预处理步骤就可调整现有形态模型，在插件式场景中具有广泛的应用价值

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种注意力引导的自编码器架构用于医疗设备制造中的深度异常检测，分别采用结构相似性异常评分和特征距离方法，在小型不平衡数据集上实现了高精度实时缺陷检测和监管合规监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备制造中的自动化视觉检测面临小样本、不平衡数据集、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战，需要开发能够满足这些约束的深度异常检测方法。

Method: 1. 基于结构相似性的异常评分方法（4-MS-SSIM），用于轻量级实时缺陷检测；2. 基于马氏距离的特征距离方法，在降维潜在特征上进行异常评分，用于监管监控。

Result: 第一种方法在仅有10%缺陷样本的情况下达到ACC 0.903（无监督阈值）和0.931（有监督阈值）；第二种方法达到ACC 0.722（有监督阈值）。两种方法均优于重新实现的基线方法。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提供了互补能力：第一种支持可靠的在线检测，第二种支持可扩展的生产后监控和监管合规监测，为在受监管制造环境中部署深度异常检测提供了实用途径，符合欧盟AI法案对高风险AI系统的要求。

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

### [56] [A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05809)
*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是SAM的概率扩展版本，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分训练目标，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码，特别适用于医学图像中存在标注不确定性的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，无法捕捉真实世界任务中固有的模糊性，特别是在医学成像中，由于标注不确定性或专家间差异可能存在多个合理的分割结果。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验网络和后验网络，通过潜在变量空间调节提示嵌入，使用变分目标进行训练，学习生成多样化的分割掩码分布。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上评估，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM成功扩展了SAM的概率能力，能够有效处理医学图像分割中的不确定性，为不确定性感知的分割任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

TL;DR: 基于MODIS占占的近实时沙尘检测系统，采用3D卷积网络分析所有36波段图像，精确区分沙尘与云层、地表特征，达到0.92准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沙尘暴对健康和能见度造成害处，需要从卫星图像中进行快速检测以发出及时警报。

Method: 使用3D卷积网络学习NASA Terra和Aqua卫星MODIS仪器的36个波段图像，包括分割的热红外波段，通过简单的数据归一化和本地填充处理缺失数据。

Result: 在17个独立的MODIS场景中，模型达到约0.92的准确度，均方误差为0.014。地图显示在罗线核心区域有强一致性，大多数错误涉及边缘区域。

Conclusion: 结合波段和空间学习可以提供及时的全球范围沙尘警报；使用更宽的输入窗口或注意力模型可能进一步锐化边缘检测。

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病细胞形态学图像的精确分割对疾病研究和诊断至关重要，但深度学习模型发展受到标注数据稀缺的限制。

Method: 系统性评估多种先进深度学习分割模型（U-Net、DeepLabV3+、SegFormer、SAM、MedSAM等），使用贝叶斯搜索进行渗透参数优化，在有限的心血管组织学图像数据集上进行测试。

Result: 模型性能很容易受到数据分割的影响，微小的性能差异更多是由统计噪声驱动，而非算法的真正优势。

Conclusion: 标准测试方法在数据稀缺的临床环境中存在限制，性能排名不能反映真正的临床价值，需要更加健壮的评估方法。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTCChat是一个多时相MLLM模型，通过Change Extraction模块和Prompt Augmentation机制提升双时相卫星影像变化分析能力，在变化描述和视觉问答任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双时相变化分析方法通过直接拼接图像对处理，无法充分建模时间相关性和空间语义变化，限制了视觉语义对齐和整体效果。

Method: 提出BTCChat模型，包含Change Extraction模块更好地捕捉时间特征和空间语义变化，以及Prompt Augmentation机制通过加入上下文线索增强对空间细节的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BTCChat通过创新的模块设计有效解决了双时相卫星影像分析中的时间建模和语义对齐问题，为城市发展监测和灾害评估等应用提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSK-GAT是一个新颖的多模态深度学习框架，结合视觉和骨骼坐标特征来分类肌肉骨骼风险，在复杂环境中实现了93%以上的准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌肉骨骼风险评估方法大多依赖单一数据类型，无法在复杂环境中可靠评估风险，需要开发多模态方法来提高风险评估的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块学习时空依赖关系，包含细粒度注意力模块（FGAM）进行跨模态特征精炼，以及多模态几何对应模块（MGCM）增强跨模态一致性。

Result: 验证准确率93.55%，测试准确率93.89%，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，Cohen's Kappa和Matthews相关系数均为93%，均方根误差0.1205，平均绝对误差0.0156，优于9个流行迁移学习骨干网络。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型推进了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有效的早期干预，为运动医学领域提供了可靠的风险评估工具。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

*Ruiqi Shen,Haotian Wu,Wenjing Zhang,Jiangjing Hu,Deniz Gunduz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，通过压缩特征嵌入而非像素重建，在极低比特率下保持语义完整性，比主流图像压缩方法节省95%以上比特率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴应用更关注语义保存而非像素级重建，需要跨数据分布和下游任务的鲁棒性能，多模态基础模型的零样本能力为此提供了新思路

Method: 利用对比语言-图像预训练(CLIP)模型，将CLIP特征嵌入压缩为最小比特，同时保持不同任务间的语义信息

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3*10^(-3)比特/像素，仅为可比性能主流方法的不到5%，在极端压缩下仍展现跨数据分布和下游任务的零样本鲁棒性

Conclusion: 基于CLIP的语义压缩方法实现了极高效的语义保存，为新兴应用提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

TL;DR: AttriPrompt是一个新颖的深度提示学习框架，通过利用CLIP视觉编码器的中间层特征来增强文本语义表示，解决了现有方法过度依赖对比学习和静态提示的问题，在三个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度文本提示方法存在两个关键局限：过度依赖对比学习目标而忽视细粒度特征优化；所有输入类别使用静态提示，缺乏内容感知适应能力。

Method: 提出AttriPrompt框架，包含属性检索模块（聚类视觉特征并检索语义相似的提示）、双流对比学习实现细粒度对齐，以及自正则化机制防止过拟合。

Result: 在三个基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，在base-to-novel设置下实现了最高7.37%的性能提升，在跨域知识迁移方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界应用中更可行的解决方案，通过层次化视觉信息和动态提示机制有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流匹配模型中应用强化学习时，SDE采样方法会导致显著的噪声色彩，影响图像质量和奖励学习的准确性。

Method: 受DDIM启发，提出了保持系数采样(CPS)方法，重新定义了采样过程，消除了SDE采样导致的噪声色彩。

Result: CPS方法能够消除噪声色彩，提高奖励学习的准确性，使得Flow-GRPO和Dance-GRPO等强化学习优化器更快更稳定地收敛。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了流匹配模型中RL应用的关键问题，CPS方法为提高图像生成质量和奖励学习效果提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Conclusion: 所提出的DIFM模块能够有效利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，多尺度边界损失显著改善了边界分割准确性，为医学图像分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D

directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Conclusion: 通过观察性子任务设计和多粒度空间关系建模，该方法在保持性能的同时有效提升了3D医学自监督学习的可解释性和直观性

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Conclusion: 通过去风格化实现可扩展数据生成提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实数据的根本挑战

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style

*Nam Duong Tran,Nam Nguyen Phuong,Hieu H. Pham,Phi Le Nguyen,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConstStyle提出了一种新的域泛化方法，通过将训练和测试数据映射到统一域来减少域偏移影响，在有限训练域和大域差距情况下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时性能下降的问题，特别是当训练域有限或与未见测试域差距较大时现有方法效果不佳

Method: 使用统一域捕获域不变特征并弥合域差距，训练时将样本映射到优化后的统一域，测试时类似投影未见域样本再进行预测

Result: 在多种场景下一致优于现有方法，当只有有限可见域时，相比次优方法准确率提升高达19.82%

Conclusion: ConstStyle通过统一域对齐策略有效减少了域偏移的影响，即使在大域差距或少量可见域情况下也能显著提升域泛化性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

TL;DR: STRIDE是一种基于扩散模型的稀疏视图CT重建方法，通过时间变化的条件重加权策略和双网络并行架构，在PSNR、SSIM和MSE指标上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像处理任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但需要专门的方法来处理稀疏视图CT重建中的缺失投影视图补全和全局信息建模问题。

Method: 提出时间变化的稀疏条件重加权引导策略，动态调整去噪过程中的权重；使用线性回归校正分布偏移；构建双网络并行架构进行全局校正和多子频率组件优化。

Result: 在公开和真实数据集上，PSNR提升2.58dB，SSIM提高2.37%，MSE降低0.236，在结构一致性、细节恢复和伪影抑制方面表现出优异的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STRIDE方法通过创新的条件重加权策略和双网络架构，成功实现了高质量的稀疏视图CT图像重建，在多个指标上显著优于现有最佳基线方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document

costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预计算分割信息先验的解耦策略，通过将分割信息直接融合到特征空间来指导3D目标检测，无需扩展检测模型或联合学习先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测由于输入是单张2D图像，缺乏深度信息，是一个不适定问题。现有方法主要使用CNN或Transformer作为特征提取骨干网络，然后通过特定检测头预测3D参数。

Method: 采用解耦策略，注入预计算的分割信息先验并直接融合到特征空间来指导检测，不扩展检测模型或联合学习先验，专注于评估分割信息对现有检测流程的影响。

Result: 在KITTI 3D目标检测基准上评估，对小目标（行人和骑行者）的检测性能优于仅依赖RGB图像特征的等效架构。

Conclusion: 理解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，分割信息的引入能有效提升单目3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Motivation: 现有的单影像位姿估计方法主要依靠静态关键点定位，没有利用空间操作中的时序信息

Method: 通过ViT编码器提取图像特征，结合预训练光流模型的运动线索来定位2D关键点，然后使用PnP求解器恢复6自由度位姿

Result: 在SPADES-RGB数据集上训练和评估，在2D关键点定位和6自由度位姿估计方面都显示出比单影像基准方法更好的性能，并在SPARK-2024数据集上展现了良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用运动动态和时序信息，有效提升了单目车船位姿估计的准确性和泛化能力

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT是一个针对盲人和低视力用户的VQA框架，通过多候选答案生成、空间定位和思维链推理来处理视觉问题中的模糊性，在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片往往模糊或构图不佳，且难以准确描述无法完全看到的内容，导致视觉问题具有模糊性，存在多个有效答案，这与传统VQA系统假设单一答案的设定不匹配。

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多个候选答案，通过PolyFormer对每个答案进行空间定位，然后应用思维链推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同的图像区域。

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中，BLaVe-CoT超越了先前的方法，对辅助场景中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了VQA系统需要适应真实人类的不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持，代码已开源以促进进一步研究和可访问性应用。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Conclusion: 通过构建专门的无人机数据集和开发CAGE融合模块，成功解决了无人机图像开词汇目标检测中的域适应问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

Motivation: 微表情识别面临临时性、细微性和动态性挑战，现有方法或依赖手工特征需要关键帧，或者深度网络受限于小规模、低多样性的训练数据。

Method: 提出将原始帧序列按时间顺序进行排序，通过新的局部-全局特征感知Transformer学习帧表征，使用排序计分器计算每个帧的排序分数，然后通过时间维度池化获取动态表征，并分享给微表情识别模块和动态图像构建模块。

Conclusion: 该方法通过序列排序编码动态信息和动态图像构建任务，有效地捝取了面部细微动作并缓解了数据稀缺问题，为微表情识别领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini

100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the

Conclusion: 集成细节保持下采样、边缘敏感表示、双域注意力和难度自适应回归，为基于无人机的电网小缺陷巡检提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真CFD模拟需要专家物理模型、细密网格和大量计算，限制了迭代速度。小规模数据驱动模型特别是GNN提供了新方案，但传统GNN在高分辨率图结构中捕捆长距离依赖时遇到困难。

Method: 设计了新的多阶段GNN架构，利用层次池化和解池化操作，在多个空间尺度上逐步建模全局到局部的相互作用。在新开发的CFD数据集上进行评估，模拟不同长宽比矩形空间内的自然对流。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了所提多阶段GNN方法在网格基流体动力学模拟中建模复杂传热过程的潜力。

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSeqFT是一个顺序微调框架，通过最大数据相似性选择和知识保留微调，在医学图像分割任务中实现了3.0%的平均Dice提升，并增强了模型的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调策略存在局限性：并行微调隔离任务无法利用共享知识，多任务微调需要同时访问所有数据集且难以增量集成任务。需要一种能够顺序适应新任务同时保持预训练知识的框架。

Method: 提出MedSeqFT顺序微调框架，包含两个核心组件：(1)最大数据相似性选择(MDS)，识别最能代表原始预训练分布的下游样本；(2)知识与泛化保留微调(K&G RFT)，基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案，平衡任务特定适应和预训练知识保留。

Result: 在两个多任务数据集上的十个3D分割任务中，MedSeqFT始终优于最先进的微调策略，平均Dice提升3.0%。在未见任务(COVID-19-20和肾脏)上的评估验证了其增强的可迁移性，特别是在肿瘤分割方面。

Conclusion: MedSeqFT建立了一种有效的、知识保留的顺序微调范式，用于将基础模型适应不断演变的临床任务，代码将发布。

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Conclusion: 所提出的基准测试和训练方案显著改善了视觉语言模型在病理领域的表现，为临床自动化诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动图像聚类在图像增强应用中受限的问题，因为传统方法难以定义对该任务有意义的聚类。

Method: 提出CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类，并引入量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE产生的聚类比基于语义图像属性的聚类更适用于图像增强，利用这些聚类重采样数据集可以提升色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强提供了有效的聚类方法，通过公开代码促进采用和可重现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D是一个基于Transformer的模型，从多光谱图像生成高光谱图像，同时保持空间和光谱质量，通过级联训练策略和优化的波段序列设计，在多个指标上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测等领域有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率的权衡问题。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度，需要开发新的解决方案。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，采用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，输入5个多光谱波段，重建224个高光谱波段。引入级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，并设计优化的波段序列来更好地捕捉波段间关系。

Result: 模型达到PSNR 35.82 dB、SAM 2.40°、SSIM 0.96的性能，比基线MHF-Net提升5.6 dB PSNR，ERGAS降低超过一半。在下游任务如土地利用分类和火烧区域分割中也表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D成功解决了多光谱到高光谱图像转换中的空间-光谱权衡问题，通过Transformer架构和创新的训练策略，在保持高质量重建的同时，展现出良好的下游任务应用潜力。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私风险，未经授权的使用可能导致生物信息泄露，侵犯个人隐私。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多样化替代年龄编码器，提供对黑盒年龄预测模型的通用防御。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物特征隐私问题，在保护隐私的同时保持了医疗图像的实用价值，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的专家模型拼接和在线标注技术，成功实现了音频-视频的协调生成，为多模态生成研究提供了新的解决方案和基准数据集。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（边界框或像素级别）设计，需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架，采用扩展的slot attention机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系slot，引入对象时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性，使用动态三元组预测模块捕捉时序交互。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一的对象中心设计可以有效地处理不同粒度的视频场景图生成任务，减少了任务特定修改并最大化参数共享。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Method: 创建包含8,600+问答对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试，并提出Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，通过生成基于估计全局3D坐标的认知地图来增强空间推理

Result: 基准测试显示当前VLMs与人类水平存在显著差距，Ego3D-VLM在多选题上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在真实世界多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤屏障功能的定量指标（SH和TEWL）对公众监测皮肤状况很重要，但需要专业仪器测量，不易普及。希望通过智能手机自拍图像实现远程评估。

Method: 构建多阶段解决方案：数据收集、预处理，提出新颖的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型进行回归，并针对数据不平衡问题提出对称对比正则化方法。

Result: 成功实现了从自拍面部图像估计SH和TEWL，通过对比正则化有效减少了模型偏差，是首个无需物理测量的皮肤评估研究。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了计算机视觉与皮肤护理研究之间的空白，为更广泛的实际应用提供了AI驱动的可访问皮肤分析方案。

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

TL;DR: PAML框架通过原型感知多模态学习解决视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的挑战，在标准场景表现优异，在开放词汇场景达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在标准场景定位表现良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含训练未见的新颖对象类别）存在三个主要限制：视觉-语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用不充分

Method: 提出PAML框架：1）使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态对齐；2）视觉判别特征编码器增强显著对象表示；3）新颖的原型发现和继承机制提取聚合多邻居语义原型；4）多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合和边界框回归

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，在标准场景表现有竞争力，在开放词汇场景达到最先进性能

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统性解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，显著提升了视觉定位在开放词汇场景的性能

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了视频领域的广义分类发现(Video-GCD)新设置，设计了一种内存引导的一致性对比学习框架(MCCL)，通过时空线索和全局上下文来提高新类别发现的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要关注静态图像，但仅靠静态视觉内容不能可靠地发现新类别。需要将GCD扩展到视频领域，利用时间维度的多视角信息来提升发现性能。

Method: 提出MCCL框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性对比学习(CACL)利用多视角时间特征估计一致性分数并加权对比损失；内存引导表征增强(MGRE)通过双级内存缓冲维护特征层和逻辑层表征，提供全局上下文来提升类内聚合性和类间分离性。

Result: 在新建的Video-GCD测试集上进行了广泛实验，证明该方法显著超过了来自图像基础设置的竞争性GCD方法，验证了时间信息对视频中新类别发现的重要性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将GCD扩展到视频领域，提出的MCCL框架通过时空一致性学习和全局表征增强，为视频新类别发现提供了有效解决方案，开源代码将公开。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Conclusion: 该工作驱动的图像分割在MLLM框架中具有高效性、可扩展性和通用性，为多模态分割提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Motivation: 现有货币识别系统通常忽视可用性和真实性评估，特别是在低资源环境中，视觉障碍用户和离线验证很常见。现有方法主要关注面额分类，但忽略了物理损坏和伪造问题，限制了在实际环境中的应用。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN模型进行面额分类，通过新颖的统一货币损坏指数(UCDI)进行损坏量化，以及使用基于特征的模板匹配进行假币检测。数据集包含超过82,000张标注图像，涵盖清洁、损坏和伪造纸币。

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists
represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains
challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This
paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy
and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs.
Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and
RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of
multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧内基础物体中获益，但使用文本描述会导致令牌长度增加和容易受到物体层面噪声影响。

Method: 设计GO-Tokenizer，一个轻量级的附加模块，利用现成的物体检测器动态编码紧凑的物体信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用GO-Tokenizer进行预训练的模型在性能上超过了原始Video-LLM和使用文本描述的对照模型，这种收益在不同模型、数据集和视频理解任务中都具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer通过有效编码物体信息，显著提升了视频大语言模型的时间敏感理解能力，为视频理解领域提供了一种更高效的方案。

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的面部防伪方法未能充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入令牌来检测关键伪造线索，且依赖单一文本提示限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含两个核心模块：多视角槽注意力(MVS)从补丁嵌入中提取局部细节和全局上下文特征；多文本补丁对齐(MTPA)将补丁与多个文本表示对齐以提高语义鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过充分利用CLIP的多文本表示和补丁嵌入，显著提升了面部防伪检测的跨域泛化能力，为解决现有方法的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

*Matthieu Gendrin,Stéphane Pateux,Théo Ladune*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对3D高斯泼溅在有限视角场景下的坐标量化问题，提出了基于球坐标的新量化方案，以减小投影误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在大场景中由于输入视角有限，只能从有限区域生成新视角（3DoF+）。传统坐标量化方法在远距离投影时会产生较大像素误差，需要更有效的量化方案。

Method: 分析位置误差对投影误差的影响，发现投影误差与投影点距离的平方成反比。基于此提出球坐标量化方案，在花园场景上进行率失真性能验证。

Result: 提出的球坐标量化方法在率失真性能上表现良好，能有效减小远距离投影时的像素误差。

Conclusion: 球坐标量化方案适用于3DoF+场景，能显著改善3DGS在有限视角条件下的坐标量化效果和投影精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight是一种基于SAM和MLLM的视频伪装目标检测新方法，通过特征融合、动态前景视觉令牌评分和解耦学习策略，解决了现有方法在边缘分离和目标背景分离方面的不足，在MoCA-Mask数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VCOD方法存在两个主要问题：SAM基础方法由于模型冻结难以分离伪装目标边缘，MLLM基础方法由于大语言模型合并前景背景导致目标可分性差。需要开发新方法同时解决边缘细节分离和目标背景分离问题。

Method: 提出Phantom-Insight方法：1）使用时序和空间线索表示视频序列，通过LLM进行特征融合增加信息密度；2）通过动态前景视觉令牌评分模块和提示网络生成多线索，自适应引导和微调SAM模型；3）提出解耦前景-背景学习策略，分别生成前景和背景线索进行解耦训练。

Result: 在MoCA-Mask数据集上的实验表明，Phantom-Insight在各种指标上均达到最先进性能。在CAD2016数据集上检测未见过的伪装目标的能力证明了其强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，并引入特征融合、动态评分模块和解耦学习策略，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的边缘分离和目标背景分离问题，展现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改进视觉推理提供了高效途径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率遥感图像变化检测中的两个关键挑战：1）模型容易将时间偏移（如光照、季节变化）引起的辐射变化误判为真实变化，导致大量误报；2）深层抽象特征与浅层细节丰富特征之间存在语义鸿沟，阻碍有效融合，导致边界划分不准确。

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

Result: 创建了WS²数据集，包含11000多帧高分辨率视频帧，包括操作前后的图像，为这一研究方向提供了基准数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为废物分拣自动化提供了一种可行的弱监督解决方案，减少了标注需求，并促进了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

TL;DR: TIDE框架通过目标监督和偏好学习解决主题驱动图像生成中保持主体身份与遵循编辑指令之间的冲突，无需测试时微调即可实现优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在主题驱动图像生成中无法充分解决保持主体身份与遵循动态编辑指令之间的张力问题

Method: 提出目标监督三元组对齐方法，使用(参考图像,指令,目标图像)三元组建模主体适应动态，通过DSD目标训练模型，系统生成和评估"获胜"(平衡保持-遵循)和"失败"(扭曲)目标

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现出优异性能，在生成主体忠实输出的同时保持指令遵循，在多个量化指标上超越基线方法

Conclusion: TIDE框架成功解决了主题驱动图像生成中的关键挑战，展示了在结构条件生成、图像到图像生成和文本图像插值等多种任务中的 versatility

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有RANO评估标准存在复杂性和观察者变异性，需要自动化方法来提高脑粘续疑疗效析的准确性和可靠性

Result: 在4类响应预测任务中达到平均ROC AUC 0.81和宏观F1分数0.50，对应完全响应、部分响应、病情稳定、病情进展

Conclusion: 学习到的图像表征与领域目标影像组学特征的协同结合，为神经脱射学预测疗效响应提供了稳健有效的自动化解决方案

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

TL;DR: 对FairCLIP的可复现性研究发现原始实现与描述不一致，新实现A-FairCLIP和FairCLIP+也未能证明FairCLIP在性能和公平性方面的改善效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Luo等人(2024)提出的FairCLIP方法的可复现性，并研究如何通过最小化Sinkhorn距离来改善CLIP模型的组群公平性

Method: 重现原实验设置，发现原实现与描述不一致后开发A-FairCLIP进行对比研究，提出支持多属性的FairCLIP+，并分析距离最小化对公平性和性能的影响

Result: 证实CLIP在零样本青光眼分类任务中存在人口统计学偏见，但实验结果不支持FairCLIP能改善CLIP的性能和公平性，虽然规则化目标减小了Sinkhorn距离，但无法提升分类性能

Conclusion: 虽然FairCLIP在理论上通过减小图像-文本相似性差异来提升公平性，但实验结果显示该方法在实际应用中无法有效改善CLIP的性能和公平性，需要更深入的研究来理解其限制因素

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Method: 创建FMOX JSON元数据文件（包含物体大小信息），使用EfficientTAM基础跟踪模型在4个开源FMO数据集上进行测试，采用轨迹交并比(TIoU)指标进行性能评估。

Result: EfficientTAM模型在FMO数据集上表现与专门为这些数据集调整的管道相比较为好，证明了其在快速移动小物体跟踪任务上的有效性。

Conclusion: FMOX元数据文件为FMO数据集提供了价值扩展，EfficientTAM模型在这些数据集上表现突出，所有代码和JSON文件都开源可用。

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检索模型的架构增强，而忽略了真实世界草图中固有的模糊性和噪声问题，需要设计对草图变异性具有鲁棒性的训练目标。

Method: 采用适当的预训练策略、编码器架构和损失函数设计组合，明确设计能够抵抗草图变异性的训练目标，不引入额外复杂性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的FS-COCO和广泛使用的SketchyCOCO数据集上进行大量实验，证实了方法的有效性，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 强调了训练设计在跨模态检索任务中的关键作用，同时指出需要改进场景级草图检索的评估场景。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了RARL方法，用于解决增量开集识别(IOSR)中的边界识别性下降问题，通过角度空间对齐和虚拟类交互训练策略，在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开集识别方法主要面向静态场景，而真实应用需要模型能够增量识别新出现的未知类，但缺乏过往训练数据导致边界识别性下降和类间混淆。

Method: 提出保持性角度表征学习(RARL)：1)在等角紧架构造的角度空间中，将未知表征对齐到非活跃原型上；2)采用虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略，通过边界近伺虚拟类增强类间边界；3)分层校正策略精炼决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上进行了全面评估，建立了IOSR新的基准，在各种任务设置下都达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: RARL方法通过角度空间表征对齐和虚拟类交互训练，有效解决了增量开集识别中的表征偏移和空间扭曲问题，显著提升了模型在演化场景下的识别性能。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学形态学在向量值图像（如彩色和高光谱图像）处理中缺乏统一的向量排序方法，需要找到最合适的排序方式来构建形态学算子。

Method: 采用机器学习方法学习一个简化排序，该排序近似于从一组向量排序中推导出的Condorcet排序，受投票问题启发，Condorcet排序将元素从最多投票到最少投票进行排序。

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习简化映射在定义彩色图像向量值形态学算子方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决向量值图像数学形态学中的排序问题提供了一种有效的机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角扩散模型大多采用非自回归形式，限制了在世界建模中的应用，因为它们只支持固定数量的视角，并且由于同时去噪所有帧而导致推理速度慢。

Method: 采用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，使用成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制。推理时结合空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减轻漂移。

Result: 实验表明CausNVS支持广泛的相机轨迹，实现灵活的自回归新视角合成，并在多样化设置下保持一致的强视觉质量。

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归方法成功解决了多视角扩散模型在视角灵活性和推理效率方面的限制，为3D新视角合成提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

Motivation: 低剂量CT和PET虽然降低了辐射暴露，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性，需要有效的去噪方法来提升图像质量

Method: 提出混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止过拟合噪声

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上验证，HSANet相比现有方法获得更优越的去噪性能，同时保持轻量级模型大小，适合标准GPU部署

Conclusion: 该方法具有很高的实际临床应用价值，能够在保持辐射安全的同时显著提升低剂量医学图像质量

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为及时预防急急识别氮缺乏程度提供了有力工具，有助于改善作物管理和植物健康

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Motivation: 高速量解释机器人收集的海底视觉图像可提高海洋监测和探索效率。虽然最近研究建议位置元数据可以增强自监督学习，但其在不同SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集上的好处尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 评估位置基于正则化对6种最先进的SSL框架的影响，包括不同隐藏空间维度的卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉Transformer(ViT)模型。在三个多样化的海底图像数据集上进行评估。

Result: 位置正则化在所有数据集上都持续改喂了下游分类性能：CNN模型平均F1分数提升4.9±4.0%，ViT模型提升6.3±8.9%。位置正则化SSL在低维隐藏表征下对CNN的改喂效果更为显著，而高维ViT模型显示出强大的沿生能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，尤其是在使用低维隐藏表征时。高维ViT模型在海底图像分析中展现出强大的沿生能力，能够匹配最佳性能的位置正则化SSL方法。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Conclusion: OCF框架具有重要应用价值，能够为长期持久自主海洋探索中的调查数据摘要生成和信息化路径规划提供支持。

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

TL;DR: VIM-GS是一个基于高斯溅射的框架，使用单目图像进行大场景的新视角合成，通过结合视觉惯性SfM的稀疏深度和大基础模型的密集深度来生成准确深度图


<details>

Motivation: 传统高斯溅射需要RGB-D/立体相机提供准确深度，但深度感知范围有限，难以处理大场景。单目图像缺乏深度信息导致渲染质量差，而现有大基础模型的深度估计存在跨帧不一致、远距离不准确和纹理歧义等问题

Method: 利用视觉惯性SfM的准确稀疏深度来优化大基础模型的粗糙密集深度，提出对象分割深度传播算法处理结构化对象，开发动态深度细化模块处理动态对象的SfM深度问题

Result: 在公开和定制数据集上的实验表明，VIM-GS在大场景中具有优越的渲染质量

Conclusion: VIM-GS成功解决了大场景中单目图像深度估计的挑战，为高质量新视角合成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net在分割准确性、效率和部署性方面完胜传统轻量级模型，适合集成到智能闭环生物打印系统中。

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

TL;DR: STAGE是一种面向分割的工业异常合成方法，通过分级扩散和显式掩码对齐技术，解决了现有方法在纹理细节、背景对齐和细粒度异常生成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常合成方法存在两个关键问题：(i)合成异常缺乏复杂纹理细节且与背景对齐不精确；(ii)难以生成细粒度的像素级异常。这限制了异常分割性能的提升。

Method: 提出STAGE框架：1)引入干净背景信息作为先验指导去噪分布；2)采用分级扩散框架和异常专用分支记录局部异常；3)使用显式掩码对齐策略逐步对齐合成异常与背景。

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的异常推理策略和分级扩散框架，成功解决了工业异常合成中的关键挑战，为异常分割提供了更高质量的合成数据支持。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

TL;DR: 提出基于对比学习的视频年龄分级分类方法，结合CNN、LSTM和注意力机制，在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率，并部署为实时分类Web应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频年龄分级方法需要大量标注数据、泛化能力差且特征学习效率低，无法满足流媒体平台对内容合规性的自动化需求

Method: 采用对比学习框架（实例判别、上下文对比学习、多视图对比学习），结合LRCN（CNN+LSTM）骨干网络和Bahdanau注意力机制，使用NT-Xent、NT-logistic和Margin Triplet等对比损失函数

Result: 在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下取得最佳性能：88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能够有效区分PG-13和R级等边界案例

Conclusion: 所提出的混合架构通过对比学习显著提升了视频年龄分级性能，实现了细粒度分类和实时部署，为流媒体平台内容合规提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

TL;DR: 城市双胎数据集（UrbanTwin）是三个公开路边lidar数据集的高保真虚拟复制品，包含10K带注释的帧，用于增强深度学习模型训练的数据量和场景多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实数据集样本量不足、场景多样性缺乏的问题，通过高保真数字双胎模型生成与真实数据对齐的合成数据集。

Method: 使用模拟lidar传感器在现实数字双胎中合成数据，基于周围几何结构、车道对齐和交叉口车辆运动模式进行精确模拟。包含3D围框、实例分割、轨迹ID和语义分割标签。

Result: 统计和结构相似性分析显示合成数据与真实数据高度对齐；仅使用合成数据训练的3D物体检测模型在真实数据上表现更优于使用真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: UrbanTwin数据集是首个能够替代领域内真实数据集的数字合成数据，有效增强了现有标准数据集，并可通过修改模拟设计和动态来测试自定义场景。

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.

Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射学诊断主要依赖单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的成像模态、疾病和放射学发现。基础模型具有跨模态泛化和低数据环境下工作的潜力，但在放射学领域尚未实现

Method: 使用一家大型医院数年的全部横断面成像输出数据训练基础模型，包含15万次检查（130TB数据），这是已知最大的真实世界医疗影像数据集

Conclusion: Curia展示了基础模型在放射学中的巨大潜力，为加速该领域发展，作者在Hugging Face上发布了模型权重

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

Conclusion: P3-SAM通过原生3D点提示分割方法，成功解决了复杂3D对象自动化分割的挑战，为3D理解和模型重用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom
dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and

marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images,
increasing from 95.3% to 99.5% for our newly introduced Pixel Accuracy metric.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the

Conclusion: 该轻量级模型为实时和资源有限的临床环境提供了实用的替代方案，在保持高准确度的同时明显提升了效率。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github

Motivation: 探索如何利用通用基础模型通过转移学习和整合手术室中的补充模态来支持手术数据科学应用，提升手术决策支持系统的性能。

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为单模态基础模型，在术中视频数据上进行微调，并通过训练独立编码器整合其他时间分辨数据流构建多模态模型。在本地肝脏手术数据集和公开HeiCo数据集上评估任务性能。

Result: 领域特定数据微调能够提升模型性能。在本地数据上，整合补充数据流同样有益。在HeiCo数据上，单模态基线模型的准确度与EndoVis2017挑战的最佳提交相当，领域适配后进一步提升了准确度。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频姿态Transformer(VPTs)计算成本过高，在资源受限设备上不实用，需要一种能够保持精度同时提高效率的方法。

Method: 采用分层剪枝-恢复框架，包含令牌剪枝模块(TPM)动态选择代表性令牌，和令牌恢复模块(TRM)恢复完整时空信息，中间层仅保留少量令牌。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持高精度的同时显著提高了效率，代码和模型已开源。

Conclusion: H₂OT证明了保持完整姿态序列是不必要的，少量代表性帧的姿势令牌即可实现高效率和估计精度，为高效视频姿态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种拓扑自适应的变形模型，用于处理包含拓扑伪影的非刚性3D网格匹配问题，能够在ARAP和双射关联约束下对齐形状对，无需数据驱动先验即可处理高度非等距形状和拓扑伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中多视角重建常出现的拓扑伪影问题，当前方法基于等距或ARAP变形的假设在这些拓扑配置下不成立。

Method: 提出拓扑自适应变形模型，联合优化具有适当拓扑的模板网格及其与待匹配形状的对齐，在ARAP和双射关联约束下提取对应关系。

Result: 方法适用于高度非等距形状和含拓扑伪影的形状，包括噪声多视角重建，在3D对齐质量上甚至优于基于大数据集训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需数据驱动先验就能有效处理拓扑变化，在现实世界的拓扑伪影场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合选择性GAN去模糊预处理和YOLOv5检测模型的自动车牌识别系统，在保持高准确度的同时实现了快速实时检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别系统在智慧城市中至关重要，但面临高变化性和模糊图像的挑战。需要一种能够在保持高准确度的同时实现快速实时检测的解决方案。

Method: 采用选择性GAN进行去模糊预处理，结合YOLOv5对象检测架构进行车牌检测和字符分割识别。选择性预处理避免了不必要的输入操作。

Result: 检测时间仅0.026秒，车牌检测准确率95%，字符识别准确率97%。Deblur-GAN预处理器将检测准确玈提高近40%，特别是对模糊车牌图像。

Conclusion: 结合YOLOv5和Deblur-GAN的方案能够在保持高准确性的同时实现快速实时检测，适合移动应用。选择性预处理有效提升了模型在模糊场景下的性能。

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出在非欧几里得球面特征空间中进行相似性学习，通过Riemannian距离在SO(4)空间中近似测地距离，改进2D/3D配准的准确性和收敛速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有欧几里得近似方法扭曲流形结构并减缓收敛速度，需要更好的方法来捕捉复杂流形结构

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，投影到球面空间，在双不变SO(4)空间中用Riemannian距离近似测地距离，推理时使用可微Levenberg-Marquardt优化

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上实验显示，在患者特定和患者无关场景中都获得了优越的准确性

Conclusion: 非欧几里得球面特征空间的相似性学习方法能够更好地捕捉流形结构，提高配准精度和收敛速度

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练大规模扩散模型的鲁棒性，在不训练辅助特征提取器的情况下实现盲图像恢复，降低计算复杂度。

Method: 从退化图像中通过模型本身提取特征，用这些退化特征扩展自注意力机制，并引入采样引导机制减少幻觉。

Result: 在合成和真实退化场景下，BIR-Adapter实现了与最先进方法相当或更好的性能，同时具有显著更低的复杂度，并能集成到其他扩散模型中。

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter提供了一种高效且灵活的盲图像恢复解决方案，能够扩展到其他图像修复任务中。

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用预训练模型在农业领域泛化能力不足，因为精细多变的冠层结构与波动的田间条件相互作用，需要作物特定的基础模型来提高田间感知的可靠性。

Method: 使用自监督学习方法在ImAg4Wheat数据集（250万张高分辨率图像，覆盖10年30个全球站点、2000多个基因型和500多种环境条件）上进行小麦特异性预训练。

Result: 在10个田间视觉任务中，FoMo4Wheat模型在冠层和器官层面均持续优于基于通用数据集预训练的最先进模型，且表征对小麦稳健并可迁移到其他作物和杂草。

Conclusion: 作物特异性基础模型对可靠的田间感知具有重要价值，为构建具有跨物种和跨任务能力的通用作物基础模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

Result: 发现最优离散化策略随模型容量而变化，揭示了离散词汇表在语言和副语言模式中的有效使用，证明了离散化训练与目标应用领域匹配的重要性。

Conclusion: 语音语言模型的离散单元表示优化需要根据模型容量选择适当策略，领域匹配对模型鲁棒性至关重要，离散词汇表能够有效捕捉语言和副语言特征。

Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language
Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual
pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,
data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage
in which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality.
Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training
and target applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于N-Gram频率张量和张量分解的新题检测方法，在HaluEval数据集上显著提升了幻觉检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，传统指标如ROUGE、BERTScore缺乏语义深度，需要更有效的幻觉检测方法

Method: 构建N-Gram频率张量提取语义结构，通过张量分解获取奇异值特征，训练MLP二分类器

Result: 在HaluEval数据集上表现显著超过传统基线方法，与最先进的LLM判断方法竞争性能相当

Conclusion: 提出的N-Gram张量方法能够更有效地检测LLM生成文本中的幻觉内容，提高了检测准确性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个触发引导的动态微调框架，能够在推理时实现自适应更新，通过检测推理失败、聚类异常样本和动态优化参数来解决大语言模型无法在推理时持续学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时无法持续适应和学习新数据，这限制了其在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: SAGE框架包含三个核心组件：触发模块实时检测推理失败；触发缓冲模块使用HDBSCAN进行流式聚类和稳定性检查；Lora存储模块通过适配器池动态优化参数更新。

Result: 评估结果显示SAGE在原子推理子任务上通过动态知识更新表现出优秀的准确性、鲁棒性和稳定性。

Conclusion: SAGE框架有效解决了大语言模型在推理时无法持续学习的问题，为复杂推理任务提供了可行的动态适应解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

TL;DR: 研究发现多智能体辩论有时反而有害，特别是在异质智能体群体中，强模型可能被弱模型说服而改变正确答案，导致准确率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多智能体辩论中模型能力多样性对辩论动态和结果的影响，此前研究只关注同质智能体群体的辩论效果。

Method: 通过一系列实验，研究不同能力模型在辩论中的互动，分析模型如何响应同伴推理并可能从正确答案转向错误答案。

Result: 辩论可能导致准确率随时间下降，即使强模型数量占优；模型倾向于选择同意而非挑战错误推理，容易受到有说服力但错误的推理影响。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论存在重要失败模式，简单的辩论应用可能导致性能退化，需要设计激励机制和适当装备来抵抗错误但具有说服力的推理。

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

Motivation: 探索如何在不运行实际翻译系统的情况下，仅通过语言特征预测翻译质量，以提高多语言评估效率

Method: 采用语言家族、文字系统、地区等语言元数据，统计词正则化比例和词数，使用Gradient Boosting模型进行预测

Result: 在203种语言上获得良好预测效果（XX→英语R²=0.66，英语→XX R²=0.72），语言类型学特征对英语翻译预测重要性更高，词正则化比例对多样化目标语预测更关键

Conclusion: 翻译质量受到词级别正则化比例和广泛语言类型学的共同影响，为多语言评估和质量估计提供了新见解

Abstract: We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy
\textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a
handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic
metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for
GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient
boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for
XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature
importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into
English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse
target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by
both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new
insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型被越来越多地用于自动评估自由形式内容，需要一种能够给单个摘要赋予绝对分数的方法，而非仅仅是成对比较。

Method: 使用合成摘要来在测试时模拟成对比机器排名，实现直接评分方法。

Result: 在SummEval、TopicalChat和HANNA评测基准上，方法与最先进的成对比评估器表现相当，相关系数分别为+0.03、-0.03和+0.05。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决绝对评分的需求，同时保持了与成对比方法相当的评估性能，为评估自由形式内容提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval
(\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05})
meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效利用员工消息数据，识别导航员培训机会，支持改善患者体验和护理质量，为医疗健康分析提供了一种计算效率更高的方法。

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

Motivation: 评估词汇分割效率对形态复杂、资源匮乏语言的影响，分析词汇分割复杂度与模型准确率的关系，以及由此产生的计算资源和经济成本问题

Method: 在AfriMMLU数据集（包含9,000个多选题、5个科目、16种非洲语言）上评估10个大语言模型，分析词汇分割复杂度（fertility：tokens/word）与准确率的关联

Result: 词汇分割复杂度可靠预测准确率，复杂度越高准确率越低；推理模型（DeepSeek, o1）在所有语言上都优于非推理模型；词汇分割复杂度翻倍导致训练成本和时间增加四倍

Conclusion: 需要开发形态学感知的词汇分割方法、公平定价策略和多语言基准测试，以实现更公平的自然语言处理

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&A) system
based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to
improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the
shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access
to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed
articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant
information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval
pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while
answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model
optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports
both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused
evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of
domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1),
show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance
compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of
RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical
literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future
work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过双向论证测试语言模型的真正理解能力，发现了谨细化导致的认知专门化问题，并提出对比谨细化方法来实现双向认知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否真正理解概念还是仅仅识别模式，以双向论证能力作为真正理解的测试标准。

Method: 提出对比谨细化（CFT）方法，使用三类示例：保持语义的正示例、语义不同的负示例和前向隐藏示例，以发展深层理解能力。

Result: CFT方法成功实现了双向论证，在保持前向任务能力的同时开发出强大的反向推理能力。

Conclusion: 双向论证既是评估AI真正理解能力的理论框架，也是培养更强大AI系统的实践训练方法。

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

*Anya Ji,Claire Augusta Bergey,Ron Eliav,Yoav Artzi,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明人们在建立新共享命名系统时不是简单的任意标签，而是通过概念协调实现语义空间的重塑，这种协调能够泛化到未讨论的新对象上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人们如何为从未讨论过的事物建立共享命名系统，验证这是简单的任意标签还是更深层次的概念协调过程。

Method: 使用KiloGram数据集的1000多个抽象七巧板图像，让302名参与者配对进行交流实验，先为一组图像建立指称惯例，然后测试他们对未讨论图像的描述一致性。

Result: 发现了强烈的泛化证据：伙伴间的描述对齐度显著提高；泛化程度随视觉相似性非线性衰减；在不同可命名性水平的图像上都表现稳健。

Conclusion: 临时约定不是任意标签，而是反映了真正的概念协调，这对指称理论和设计更自适应的语言代理具有重要意义。

Abstract: How do people talk about things they've never talked about before? One view
suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

TL;DR: CoPeD方法通过引入正确性感知的任务设置和加权损失函数，提升小语言模型从大语言模型生成的思维链数据中学习推理质量的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型通过微调大语言模型生成的思维链数据来复制推理能力，但这些数据可能包含噪声推理，导致小模型学习到虚假的相关性，影响推理质量

Method: 提出Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD)：1) 正确性感知任务设置，鼓励模型基于正确推理预测答案并修正错误；2) 正确性感知加权损失，根据推理和答案的联合损失动态调整训练样本权重

Result: 实验表明CoPeD在分布内和分布外的基准推理数据集上都有效

Conclusion: CoPeD通过改进任务设置和数据利用方式，有效提升了学生模型的推理质量，特别是在处理噪声推理数据时表现出色

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

TL;DR: Icon²提出了一种利用LLM表示空间内在调节机制的高效偏好数据集构建方法，通过层间方向向量编码人类偏好，在降低48.1%计算成本的同时，在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard上平均胜率提升13%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好数据集构建方法存在两个主要问题：依赖预收集指令导致与目标模型分布不匹配，以及需要采样多个随机响应带来巨大计算开销

Method: 1) 提取层间方向向量编码复杂人类偏好 2) 基于内在一致性过滤自合成指令 3) 在解码时应用双向内在控制来引导token表示，精确生成具有明显对齐差异的响应对

Result: Llama3-8B和Qwen2-7B在AlpacaEval 2.0上平均胜率提升13.89%，在Arena-Hard上提升13.45%，同时计算成本降低高达48.1%

Conclusion: Icon²通过利用LLM表示空间的内在调节机制，实现了高效且定制化的偏好数据集构建，在提升对齐效果的同时显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by
up to 48.1%.

Abstract: The paradigm shift from traditional ranked-based search to Generative Search
Engines has rendered conventional SEO metrics obsolete, creating an urgent need
to understand, measure, and optimize for content influence on synthesized
answers. This paper introduces a comprehensive, end-to-end framework for
Generative Search Engine Optimization (GSEO) to address this challenge. We make
two primary contributions. First, we construct CC-GSEO-Bench, a large-scale,
content-centric benchmark, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework
that systematically quantifies influence, moving beyond surface-level
attribution to assess substantive semantic impact. Second, we design a novel
multi-agent system that operationalizes this framework, automating the
strategic refinement of content through a collaborative analyze-revise-evaluate
workflow. Our empirical analysis using this framework reveals novel insights
into the dynamics of content influence, offering actionable strategies for
creators and establishing a principled foundation for future GSEO research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不平衡最优传输的声学-语言学对齐模型，用于解决ASR中知识迁移的表示对齐问题，能够处理分布不匹配和结构不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声学和语言学表示的对齐是ASR知识迁移中的核心挑战，这种对齐具有内在的结构不对称性（多对一、一对多关系），且声学序列常包含无对应语言学标记的帧（如背景噪声）。

Method: 将对齐问题视为检测问题，提出不平衡最优传输对齐模型，通过软性和部分匹配处理模态间分布不匹配和结构不对称性，确保每个语言学标记至少对应一个声学观测。

Result: 在基于CTC的ASR系统与预训练语言模型的知识迁移实验中，该方法能够灵活控制匹配程度，有效提升了ASR性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为声学-语言学对齐提供了新的视角和有效解决方案，通过概率映射方式处理了知识迁移中的结构不对称问题。

Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

Abstract: The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener
experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the
task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six
emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A
manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS)
approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure
reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models
(LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model
specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results
reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned
models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings
highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts,
providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music
information retrieval applications. The labeled dataset is available at

Motivation: 现有意图检测方法主要关注文本数据，忽略了对话系统中重要的结构信息（如查询-查询关系和查询-回答关系），导致无法有效捕捉对话的结构特征。

Method: 提出SAID框架，统一整合文本和关系结构信息进行预训练；设计查询自适应注意力网络(QueryAdapt)，在关系标记级别生成意图特定的关系标记，实现细粒度知识迁移。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的大量实验结果表明，SAID显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过同时利用文本和结构信息，SAID框架在少样本意图检测任务中取得了显著改进，证明了结构信息在对话系统意图检测中的重要性。

Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The
datasets and models will be released at https://github.com/Ashone3/LM-Searcher.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法重用通常要求问题高度相似，限制了应用范围。本文旨在扩展方法重用能力，使其能够处理相似度较低或具有隐藏相似性的问题，提高跨问题方法重用的有效性。

Method: 首先将问题和解决方案分离，而不是直接将问题-解决方案对输入LLM。然后指导LLM将解决方案适配到新的相关问题上，使其专注于解决方案迁移而非问题识别。该方法还扩展到仅共享部分特征或隐藏特征的情况。

Result: 实验验证表明，该范围扩展方法提高了筛选出可重用解决方案的概率，从而改善了跨问题方法重用的效果。

Conclusion: 通过分离问题和解决方案并指导LLM专注于解决方案迁移，本文提出的方法成功扩展了方法重用的范围，能够处理低相似度和隐藏相似性的问题，显著提升了跨问题方法重用的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

Abstract: We present Llama-GENBA-10B, a trilingual foundation model addressing
English-centric bias in large language models. Built on Llama 3.1-8B and scaled
to 10B parameters, Llama-GENBA-10B is continuously pretrained on 164B tokens
(82B English, 82B German, and 80M Bavarian), balancing resources while
preventing English dominance. Targeted at the German NLP community, the model
also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four
challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2)
creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing
architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and
(4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by
translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that
Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned
variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing
itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also
outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German. Training
on the Cerebras CS-2 demonstrated efficient large-scale multilingual
pretraining with documented energy use, offering a blueprint for inclusive
foundation models that integrate low-resource languages.

Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型的能力测试通常涉及不需要理解微妙数值信息的任务，而嵌入模型越来越多地应用于金融、医疗等数值关键的领域，因此需要考察其是否能准确编码数值内容

Method: 使用金融上下文中的合成数据，对13个广泛使用的文本嵌入模型进行评估，分析其在数值细节编码方面的表现

Result: 文本嵌入模型普遍在准确捕捉数值细节方面表现差强，无法区分类似"2%"和"20%"这样的微妙数值差异

Conclusion: 当前嵌入模型在数值理解能力上存在显著缺陷，需要未来研究加强嵌入模型基础的NLP系统在数值内容处理方面的能力

Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing
applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do
not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result,
it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode
numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Farsi虽然被归类为中资源语言，但在主观性NLP任务（情感分析、情绪分析、毒性检测）中面临严重的数据可用性和质量问题，现有数据集缺乏关键人口统计信息，模型性能不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Farsi拥有超过1.27亿使用者和大量数字文本资源，但研究发现该语言在主观NLP任务中的实际资源状况被高估，需要深入评估其真实的数据挑战。

Method: 回顾了110篇关于Farsi主观任务的文献，分析数据集的可用性和质量，评估现有预测模型在不同数据集上的稳定性。

Result: 发现公开数据集严重缺乏，现有数据集缺少年龄、性别等关键人口统计信息，模型在不同数据集和模型间的预测结果极不稳定。

Conclusion: 单纯的数据量增长不足以显著改善语言在NLP中的前景，数据质量和关键信息的完整性更为重要。

Abstract: Given Farsi's speaker base of over 127 million people and the growing
availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on
Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label
quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three
subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection)
and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the
overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective
tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and
gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When
evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are
highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the
volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects
in NLP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QCSE的预训练量子上下文敏感嵌入模型，利用量子系统特性学习语言上下文关系，包含五种上下文矩阵计算方法，在富拉尼语和英语语料上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用量子计算的优势来编码和理解自然语言的复杂性，特别是解决低资源语言数据不足的问题，通过量子原生上下文学习实现语言任务的量子计算应用。

Method: 开发了QCSE量子上下文敏感嵌入模型，提出五种上下文矩阵计算方法（指数衰减、正弦调制、相位偏移、哈希变换等），在富拉尼语和英语语料上进行评估。

Result: QCSE成功捕获了上下文敏感性，并利用量子系统的表达能力来表示丰富的上下文感知语言信息，特别是在低资源的富拉尼语上表现出色。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了量子计算在自然语言处理中的强大潜力，为将QNLP应用于现实世界语言挑战开辟了新途径，特别是在处理低资源语言方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

TL;DR: VeriFact-CoT是一种新颖方法，通过事实验证-反思-引用整合的多阶段机制，解决LLM在生成复杂事实敏感内容时的幻觉和缺乏可信引用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在生成复杂事实敏感内容时普遍存在的幻觉问题和缺乏可信引用来源的问题，提高生成内容的准确性和可信度。

Method: 采用多阶段机制，包括事实验证、反思和引用整合，使LLM能够批判性地自我检查和修订其中间推理步骤和最终答案。

Result: 显著提高了生成输出的客观准确性、可信度和可追溯性，使LLM在需要高保真度的应用中更加可靠。

Conclusion: VeriFact-CoT方法有效增强了LLM生成内容的可信度和准确性，特别适用于科学研究、新闻报道和法律咨询等高要求应用场景。

Abstract: This research introduces VeriFact-CoT (Verified Factual Chain-of-Thought), a
novel method designed to address the pervasive issues of hallucination and the
absence of credible citation sources in Large Language Models (LLMs) when
generating complex, fact-sensitive content. By incorporating a multi-stage
mechanism of 'fact verification-reflection-citation integration,' VeriFact-CoT
empowers LLMs to critically self-examine and revise their intermediate
reasoning steps and final answers. This process significantly enhances the
objective accuracy, trustworthiness, and traceability of the generated outputs,
making LLMs more reliable for applications demanding high fidelity such as
scientific research, news reporting, and legal consultation.

TL;DR: LatinX是一个多语言文本转语音模型，用于语音翻译中保持说话人身份，通过三阶段训练和DPO优化，在WER和说话人相似度方面优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音翻译中跨语言保持源说话人身份的问题，特别是在英语和罗曼语系语言之间。

Method: 12层解码器Transformer，三阶段训练：文本到音频预训练、零样本语音克隆微调、基于WER和说话人相似度的DPO对齐。

Result: DPO版本相比微调基线持续降低WER并提高客观相似度，人工评估显示比XTTSv2基线有更强的感知说话人相似度。

Conclusion: 拉丁X模型在跨语言说话人身份保持方面表现优异，但客观与主观评估存在差距，未来需要平衡偏好信号和低延迟架构。

Abstract: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded
speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity
across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in
three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised
fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word
Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance
languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER
and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human
evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a
strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective
measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference
signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.

TL;DR: 中医方前主动生成框架ZhiFangDanTai，结合图谱RAG和大语言模型微调，提升方前生成的完整性和详细程度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中医方前生成模型缺乏完整的方前组成、详细解释和深度信息，如君臣使作、功效、禁忌等关键细节

Method: 提出ZhiFangDanTai框架，结合图谱基于检索增强生成(GraphRAG)和LLM微调技术，通过检索结构化中医知识并构建增强指令数据集

Result: 在收集和临床数据集上，ZhiFangDanTai较现有最佳模型取得显著改进，并提供理论证明能够降低母合误差和幻觉率

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了中医方前生成中的深度信息缺失问题，为可解释性中医方前生成提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的临床文本中事实准确性评估是重要障碍，专家审查无法满足连续质量保障的需求。

Method: 提出MedFactEval框架：临床医生定义关键事实，通过"LLM院士"（多LLM多数决策）评估生成摘要中的包含情况；同时提出MedAgentBrief多步工作流生成高质量出院摘要。

Result: 七名医生多数决策确立金标准，MedFactEval的LLM院士与专家组达到很高一致性（Cohen's kappa=81%），性能统计上不差于单个人类专家（kappa=67%，P < 0.001）。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了健壁的评估框架和高性能生成流程，为生成式AI在临床工作流中的负责任部署提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury
achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a
performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert
(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework
(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),
offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of
generative AI in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 本文研究不同对齐方法如何影响LLM在多轮多方协作中的效果，提出摩擦代理干预机制和反事实评估框架，发现摩擦感知方法在促进共识和任务正确性方面显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM成为人类协作伙伴，需要确保其在多轮交互中的行为可预测和可靠。现有对齐技术主要针对单用户场景，缺乏对多方长期交互动态的考虑。

Method: 使用角色扮演方法评估不同训练方式的摩擦代理在协作任务对话中的干预效果，提出反事实评估框架量化干预对协作轨迹和信念对齐的影响。

Result: 摩擦感知方法在帮助群体达成共识（共同基础）和任务结果正确性方面显著优于常见对齐基线方法。

Conclusion: 针对多轮多方协作场景设计的摩擦感知对齐方法比传统单用户对齐技术更有效，能够更好地促进群体协作质量和决策正确性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

*Yue Gu,Zhihao Du,Ying Shi,Shiliang Zhang,Qian Chen,Jiqing Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过精细化的语义相关性聚合模型（PSC-Joint），从列表、短语和标记三个级别聚合最相关的偏置信息，解决了交叉注意力模型在长偏置列表下性能下降的问题，在AISHELL-1和KeSpeech数据集上实现了显著的F1分数提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交叉注意力模型在识别个性化偏置短语方面取得了显著进步，但偏置信息量的变化影响其效果，特别是当偏置列表长度增加时。研究发现不管偏置列表长度如何，只有少量偏置信息与ASR中间表示最相关。

Method: 提出净化语义相关性聚合模型（PSC-Joint）方法，从粗细到细粒度定义和计算三种语义相关性：列表级、短语级和标记级。通过聚合模型生成这三种相关性的交集，强调并集成各种粒度下最相关的偏置信息。使用基于分组竞争策略的净化机制过滤无关偏置短语，以降低计算成本。

Result: 在AISHELL-1和KeSpeech数据集上，PSC-Joint方法在不同长度的偏置列表下实现了平均相对F1分数提升，分别达到了21.34%和28.46%。

Conclusion: PSC-Joint方法通过聚合不同粒度的语义相关性并突出最相关的偏置信息，有效减轻了偏置信息量变化对上下文ASR的影响，同时通过净化机制控制了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协同设计的方法，通过并行解码机制、深度参数共享和轻量级路由器，解决了早期退出机制在批处理推理中造成的系统性痴盐，在保持模型性能的同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型都遍存在计算成本高的问题。虽然适应性计算方法如早期退出能够降低成本，但在批处理推理中会造成系统级别的痴盐，反而对吞吐量产生负面影响。

Method: 1）提出高效并行解码机制来减少传统早期退出的开销
2）利用深度参数共享架构缓解动态推理中的同步问题
3）开发统一框架，通过预训练的轻量级路由器动态分配每个token的最优递归深度

Result: 该方法在保持模型性能的前提下，有效地减少了计算成本，并且避免了动态计算在批处理中造成的系统痴盐问题。

Conclusion: 通过算法和架构的协同设计，该研究成功地在动态性和效率之间找到了最优平衡，为大型语言模型的实际部署提供了一种新的效率-性能底线方案。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

TL;DR: KatotohananQA是TruthfulQA基准的菲律宾语翻译版本，用于评估大语言模型在低资源语言中的真实性表现。研究发现英语和菲律宾语之间存在显著性能差距，新OpenAI模型展现较强多语言鲁棒性，但不同问题类型存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实性基准主要针对英语，缺乏对低资源语言的评估，限制了LLMs在多语言环境中的可靠应用。

Method: 将TruthfulQA基准翻译成菲律宾语(KatotohananQA)，使用二元选择框架评估7个免费专有模型，比较英语和菲律宾语版本的表现差异。

Result: 发现英语和菲律宾语真实性表现存在显著差距，GPT-5和GPT-5 mini展现较强多语言鲁棒性，不同问题类型、类别和主题的多语言迁移鲁棒性存在差异。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的多语言评估来确保LLMs的公平性和可靠性，某些问题类型在多语言迁移中表现较弱，突显了多语言基准的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet
they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in
low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino
translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models
were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant
performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI
models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness.
Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting
that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to
multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual
evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage.

TL;DR: MFCIG-CSS是一个基于多模态细粒度上下文交互图的对话语音合成系统，通过构建语义和韵律两个交互图来建模词级别的细粒度交互，显著提升了对话韵律表达效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话语音合成方法主要关注话语级别的交互建模，忽视了多模态对话历史中词级别的细粒度语义和韵律知识，导致生成的语音韵律不够自然。

Method: 构建两个多模态细粒度对话交互图（语义交互图和韵律交互图），编码词级别语义、韵律及其对后续话语影响的交互特征，利用这些特征增强合成语音的自然对话韵律。

Result: 在DailyTalk数据集上的实验表明，MFCIG-CSS在韵律表达性方面优于所有基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度的多模态上下文交互建模，可以有效提升对话语音合成的韵律自然度，该方法在对话语音合成领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at

TL;DR: OLieRA方法通过引入李群理论和乘法更新，在保持LLM参数几何结构的同时应用正交约束，解决了连续多任务学习中灾难性遗忘问题，在标准基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数正则化方法（如O-LoRA和N-LoRA）虽然通过强制低秩子空间正交性来减轻任务干扰，但忽略了传统加法微调会破坏LLM参数内在几何结构的问题，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出OLieRA方法，将李群理论引入LLM微调：利用乘法更新保持参数几何结构，同时对任务子空间应用正交性约束。

Result: 实验表明OLieRA在标准连续学习基准测试中达到最先进结果，在大量任务设置中保持顶级性能。

Conclusion: 保持LLM参数空间的几何结构对于缓解灾难性遗忘至关重要，OLieRA通过结合李群理论和正交约束有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of
Tasks setting.

Motivation: 需要评估大型语言模型在政治敏感语境中的表现，特别是识别和量化模型可能存在的偏见问题，以促进NLP在政治领域的公平性和问责制研究。

Method: 构建EuroParlVote数据集，包含欧洲议会辩论演讲、投票结果和议员人口统计数据，并在两个任务上评估LLM：性别分类和投票预测。

Result: LLM存在系统性偏见：经常将女性议员误分类为男性；在模拟女性演讲者投票时准确率降低；政治倾向上偏向中间派，在极左和极右派表现较差；专有模型（如GPT-4o）在鲁棒性和公平性上优于开源模型。

Conclusion: EuroParlVote基准揭示了LLM在政治语境中的偏见问题，强调了在NLP政治应用中需要关注公平性和问责制，该数据集和工具的发布将支持未来相关研究。

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness

Motivation: 解决公开合成数据集缺失的问题，研究合成数据对文本嵌入模型泛化能力的具体作用机制。

Method: 首先复现并公开发布Wang等人提出的合成数据，然后系统分析合成数据在哪些方面真正提升模型泛化性能。

Result: 合成数据质量高且能带来性能提升，但改进效果仅限于个别数据集，不同任务间存在性能权衡，一个任务的提升可能导致另一个任务性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前合成数据方法无法构建真正通用的嵌入模型，训练合成数据并不能带来跨任务的鲁棒性提升，挑战了现有认知。

Abstract: Recent progress in developing general purpose text embedders has been driven
by training on ever-growing corpora of synthetic LLM-generated data.
Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier
to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first
reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.
(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent
improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly
synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that
benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual
datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different
categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.
Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for
building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to recruitment automation. Large
Language Models (LLMs) were fine-tuned to improve accuracy and efficiency.
Building upon our previous work on the Multilayer Large Language Model-Based
Robotic Process Automation Applicant Tracking (MLAR) system . This work
introduces a novel methodology. Training fine-tuned LLMs specifically tuned for
recruitment tasks. The proposed framework addresses the limitations of generic
LLMs by creating a synthetic dataset that uses a standardized JSON format. This
helps ensure consistency and scalability. In addition to the synthetic data
set, the resumes were parsed using DeepSeek, a high-parameter LLM. The resumes
were parsed into the same structured JSON format and placed in the training
set. This will help improve data diversity and realism. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance
metrics, such as exact match, F1 score, BLEU score, ROUGE score, and overall
similarity compared to base models and other state-of-the-art LLMs. In
particular, the fine-tuned Phi-4 model achieved the highest F1 score of 90.62%,
indicating exceptional precision and recall in recruitment tasks. This study
highlights the potential of fine-tuned LLMs. Furthermore, it will revolutionize
recruitment workflows by providing more accurate candidate-job matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mask-GCG是一种改进的越狱攻击方法，通过可学习的token掩码识别后缀中关键token，修剪低影响力token来减少冗余和计算开销，同时保持攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCG越狱攻击方法使用固定长度的后缀，但其中可能存在冗余token未被探索，需要更高效和可解释的攻击方法。

Method: 提出Mask-GCG方法，使用可学习的token掩码来识别后缀中高影响力位置，增加这些位置的更新概率，同时修剪低影响力位置的token。

Result: 实验表明后缀中大部分token对攻击成功很重要，修剪少数低影响力token不会影响损失值或攻击成功率，揭示了LLM提示中的token冗余。

Conclusion: Mask-GCG提供了从越狱攻击角度开发高效和可解释LLM的见解，能够减少计算开销并缩短成功攻击时间。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PL-CA提出参数化RAG框架，将法律知识编码到参数向量中并通过LoRA集成到LLM前馈网络，缓解上下文压力，同时构建专家标注的多任务法律数据集验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法直接将检索文档注入模型上下文，受限于有限上下文窗口，引入额外计算开销并干扰模型注意力，影响下游任务性能。现有基准缺乏专家标注且只关注单一任务，无法反映真实法律场景需求。

Method: 提出参数化RAG(P-RAG)框架，对语料知识进行数据增强并编码为参数向量，通过LoRA技术将参数化知识集成到LLM的前馈网络中。构建包含2000+专家标注实例的多任务法律数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少长上下文开销的同时，在下游任务上保持与传统RAG相当的竞争性能。

Conclusion: PL-CA通过参数化知识集成有效缓解了模型上下文压力，为法律领域的知识增强提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型的多语言常识生成能力，通过MULTICOM基准测试评估了多个开源LLM在英语、西班牙语、荷兰语和瓦伦西亚语上的表现，发现英语表现最佳，资源较少语言表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在多语言环境下的常识生成能力，特别是针对不同资源丰富程度的语言进行比较分析。

Method: 创建MULTICOM基准测试（基于COCOTEROS数据集扩展至4种语言），评估LLaMA、Qwen、Gemma、EuroLLM和Salamandra等开源模型，结合自动指标、LLM作为评判者（使用Prometheus和JudgeLM）和人工标注进行综合评估。

Result: 英语表现最优，资源较少语言（如瓦伦西亚语）表现显著较差；上下文支持对低资源语言有一定帮助但效果不一。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在多语言常识生成方面存在明显局限性，特别是在资源较少的语言上表现不佳，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: This paper explores the multilingual commonsense generation abilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate this investigation, we introduce
MULTICOM, a novel benchmark that extends the COCOTEROS dataset to four
languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian. The task involves generating
a commonsensical sentence that includes a given triplet of words. We evaluate a
range of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, EuroLLM, and
Salamandra, on this benchmark. Our evaluation combines automatic metrics,
LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human
annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with
significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual
support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages.
These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual
commonsense generation. The dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有开源web代理要么在复杂任务上信息搜索能力有限，要么缺乏透明实现，关键挑战在于缺乏挑战性的信息搜索数据

Method: 提出WebExplorer系统数据生成方法：使用模型基于探索和迭代、长到短查询进化技术，创建需要多步推理和复杂web导航的挑战性查询-答案对，然后通过监督微调+强化学习培养WebExplorer-8B模型

Result: WebExplorer-8B在多个信息搜索测试中达到同规模下最佳性能：在BrowseComp-en/zh超过WebSailor-72B，在WebWalkerQA和FRAMES上达到100B参数以内最佳性能，平均搜索16次转换，同时在HLE测试中也表现出强大的过渡逆继性

Conclusion: WebExplorer提供了一条实用的路径来开发长期限web代理，通过系统化的挑战性数据生成和模型培养方法，生成的8B模型能够在多个任务上达到超过更大模型的性能

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种新的层间缩放变体（Framed、Reverse、Crown），通过重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头来优化Transformer架构，在固定参数预算下实现了比各向同性基线更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型使用统一的层尺寸，忽略了不同深度层可能承担的不同功能角色和计算容量需求，希望通过层间缩放来优化模型架构。

Method: 基于层间缩放和剪枝文献，提出了三种新的LWS变体，在预训练阶段通过两或三点线性插值重新分配FFN宽度和注意力头。在180M参数预算和5B tokens上进行了系统消融实验。

Result: 所有模型都收敛到相似的损失，相比等成本各向同性基线获得了更好的性能，且训练吞吐量没有显著下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了预训练层间架构设计空间的初步探索，未来需要在更大规模的tokens和参数上进行实验以充分评估其潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer
sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can
play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling
(LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed,
Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two
or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the
first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M
parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and
achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an
initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for
pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude
more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

TL;DR: LAMDAS是一种利用预训练LLM作为隐式分类器的数据选择方法，通过将数据选择重构为单类分类问题，仅使用少量参考数据就能高效筛选高质量领域数据，在性能和计算效率方面都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 领域适配LLM面临高质量人工标注数据稀缺的瓶颈，大量未筛选数据直接用于微调会引入噪声导致性能下降。现有数据选择方法无法同时保证准确性和效率。

Method: 利用预训练LLM本身作为隐式分类器，将数据选择问题重构为单类分类，基于少量参考数据集识别属于目标领域的候选数据，避免显式特征工程和计算密集型优化过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，LAMDAS仅使用少量数据就能超越全数据训练的性能，在多种场景下优于9个SOTA基线方法，在性能提升和计算效率之间达到了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: LAMDAS提供了一种高效准确的数据选择方法，解决了领域适配中的数据稀缺和质量问题，为LLM的领域专业化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

TL;DR: SLiNT是一个结合知识图谱结构信息和大语言模型语义能力的链接预测框架，通过结构注入和对比学习解决稀疏性和歧义性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识图谱链接预测中结构稀疏和语义歧义问题，特别是在不完整或零样本设置下，大语言模型对结构信号利用不足的挑战

Method: 提出SLiNT框架：1) Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) 检索伪邻居丰富稀疏实体；2) Dynamic Hard Contrastive Learning (DHCL) 通过硬正负样本插值解决实体级歧义；3) Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) 进行token级结构感知干预，同时保持核心LLM参数

Result: 在WN18RR和FB15k-237数据集上，SLiNT相比基于嵌入和基于生成的基线方法取得了优越或竞争性的性能

Conclusion: SLiNT证明了结构感知表示学习对于可扩展知识图谱补全的有效性，通过注入知识图谱结构上下文到冻结的LLM骨干中，实现了稳健的链接预测

Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR
and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance
compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for
scalable knowledge graph completion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAVE是一个无需微调的参数无关解码框架，通过头部自适应门控和价值校准来解决LLM幻觉问题，在多个QA基准测试中有效减少幻觉并优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在检索增强生成长上下文生成中经常产生幻觉，即使相关证据存在。这源于两个问题：头部重要性被视为输入无关的，原始注意力权重不能很好地反映每个token的真实贡献

Method: HAVE框架包含头部自适应门控（实例级软重加权注意力头）和价值校准（通过价值向量大小增强注意力来近似写回贡献），通过轻量级不确定性缩放策略将token级证据与语言模型分布融合

Result: 在多个QA基准测试和不同LLM家族上的实验表明，HAVE持续减少幻觉并优于包括DAGCD在内的强基线方法，且开销适中

Conclusion: HAVE框架透明、可复现，可轻松与现成LLM集成，在现实场景中推进可信生成

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world
settings.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has
driven the need for structured and reliable responses. A key challenge in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is ensuring that outputs align
with expected formats while minimizing hallucinations. This study examines the
role of guided decoding in RAG systems, comparing three methods, Outlines,
XGrammar, and LM Format Enforcer, across different multi-turn prompting setups
(0-turn, 1-turn, and 2-turn). By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates,
and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and
applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided
decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method
selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of
structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights

Motivation: 现有RAG系统的粗排优化方法难以平衡领域特定知识学习和查询增强，导致检索性能不佳。

Method: 两阶段管道：1）使用混合损失（MoL）进行持续预训练，平衡领域知识和通用语言能力；2）利用组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行强化学习，优化查询和段落生成以最大化文档召回率。创新包括多查询单段落后期融合（MSLF）策略。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MoLER实现了最先进的性能，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MoLER弥合了RAG系统中的知识差距，能够在专业领域实现鲁棒且可扩展的检索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and

*Xingwei Tan,Mahathi Parvatham,Chiara Gambi,Gabriele Pergola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IntrEx是首个针对教师-学生互动中有趣性和预期有趣性的大规模标注数据集，用于研究教育对话中的参与度。研究发现微调后的7B/8B参数LLM在预测人类有趣性判断方面优于GPT-4o等大型专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二语习得中参与度和动机至关重要，但维持学习者在教育对话中的兴趣仍具挑战性。现有研究主要关注教育文本的有趣性，而对对话中驱动参与度的语言特征了解甚少。

Method: 基于教师-学生聊天室语料库(TSCC)构建IntrEx数据集，采用序列级标注和基于比较的评分方法，使用100多名二语学习者进行严格标注，并研究LLM预测人类有趣性判断的能力。

Result: 微调后的7B/8B参数LLM在预测有趣性判断方面表现优于GPT-4o等大型模型。分析发现具体性、可理解性(可读性)和接受度等语言和认知因素影响教育对话中的参与度。

Conclusion: 专门数据集在建模教育环境中的参与度方面具有潜力，语言和认知因素是影响教育对话参与度的重要驱动因素。

Abstract: Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet
maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge.
While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting,
still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了识别论点中人类价值主观性的方法，发现直接主观性识别比通过价值预测推断主观性更有效，且对比损失与二元交叉熵损失的组合不提升性能但减少对标签主观性的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚合多个标注为单一真实标签可能掩盖标注者分歧的宝贵见解，特别是在主观性起关键作用的任务中。本研究旨在识别论点中激励性人类价值的主观性。

Method: 评估两种主要方法：通过价值预测推断主观性 vs 直接识别主观性。实验结合对比损失和二元交叉熵损失进行模型训练。

Result: 直接主观性识别显著提高了标记主观论点的模型性能。对比损失与二元交叉熵损失的组合不改善性能但减少了对每个标签主观性的依赖。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可以帮助识别个体可能有不同解释的论点，促进更细致的标注过程。

Abstract: Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide
valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where
subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for
identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate
arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through
value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show
that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a
more nuanced annotation process.

*Yanrui Du,Fenglei Fan,Sendong Zhao,Jiawei Cao,Qika Lin,Kai He,Ting Liu,Bing Qin,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IFT训练会损害LLM的安全性，特别是拒绝恶意指令的能力。研究发现拒绝方向(r-direction)在训练中会漂移，提出ProCon方法通过投影约束损失来缓解这种漂移，并通过预热策略增强效果，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令微调(IFT)虽然能增强大语言模型的各种能力，但会显著损害模型的安全性，特别是拒绝恶意指令的能力，这引发了严重的安全担忧。

Method: 提出ProCon方法：1）引入投影约束损失项，正则化训练样本隐藏状态在r-direction上的投影幅度；2）基于早期剧烈漂移观察和数据驱动视角，引入预热策略，强调早期强约束和拓宽数据分布来增强约束信号。

Result: 在各种数据集、场景和LLM上的实验结果表明，该方法能显著缓解IFT带来的安全风险，同时保持任务性能增益。与强基线相比，始终提供更优的整体性能。

Conclusion: ProCon有助于在训练过程中稳定r-direction，这种基于可解释性的LLM内部机制探索为未来的安全研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

*Haoyu Dong,Pengkun Zhang,Mingzhe Lu,Yanzhen Shen,Guolin Ke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MachineLearningLM是一个通过持续预训练框架，使通用大语言模型具备强大上下文机器学习能力，同时保持通用知识的系统。它在少样本到1024样本的ML任务上表现优异，在多个领域超越强基线模型约15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具有广泛的世界知识和推理能力，但在标准机器学习任务中难以通过纯上下文学习从大量样本中有效学习，需要梯度下降训练。

Method: 使用结构因果模型合成数百万个ML任务进行持续预训练，采用随机森林教师模型将树基决策策略蒸馏到LLM中，使用token高效的提示序列化方法，支持批量推理。

Result: 在金融、物理、生物和医疗等领域的分布外表格分类任务上平均超越强基线约15%，展现出从8到1024样本的单调增长扩展规律，在MMLU上保持75.4%的通用能力。

Conclusion: MachineLearningLM成功地为通用LLM注入了强大的上下文ML能力，同时保持了原有的通用知识和推理能力，实现了无需任务特定训练就能达到随机森林级别性能的目标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it
attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat
capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves
75.4% on MMLU.

TL;DR: MoGU_v2框架通过动态路由机制平衡LLM的安全性和可用性，在多个LLM系列中实现稳定改进，无需在安全性和实用性之间进行权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法往往导致过于保守的拒绝响应，损害了实际可用性，需要在安全性和可用性之间找到更好的平衡点。

Method: 提出MoGU_v2框架，在编码高可分类安全特征的层中嵌入路由器，通过双向适配机制实现安全优化和可用性优化变体之间的动态权重分配。

Result: MoGU_v2在各种LLM系列中表现出强大的适应性和稳定改进，包括主流LLM、设备端LLM和推理LLM，并能通过简单数据混合策略轻松恢复安全性。

Conclusion: MoGU_v2是一个强大且多功能的解决方案，能够有效缓解现实应用中的安全风险，同时保持任务性能增益。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

Method: 基于E-prover的饱和推理技术，从TPTP公理库生成保证正确的定理，组织成三类难度可控的挑战任务：含义验证、前提选择和证明重构

Result: 前沿模型在需要深层结构化推理的任务上表现崩溃，显示了现有模型的不足

Conclusion: 该框架既提供了评估模型推理能力缺口的诊断工具，也为解决这些问题提供了可扩展的符号训练数据来源

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个开源框架，用于基准测试大语言模型在风力气气轮维护日志分类任务上的性能，并推荐人在循环系统作为最佳应用方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电维护日志的非结构化特性导致自动化分析困难，需要一个可重现的框架来评估LLM在这些复杂工业记录上的表现。

Method: 开发公开的开源框架，系统性评估各种专有和开源LLM，分析它们在可靠性、运营效率和模型检验方面的特性。

Result: 结果显示了清晰的性能层次，识别出了与标准高度对齐的顶级模型。分类性能依赖于任务语义模糊性，所有模型在对象性组件识别上比解释性维护动作更一致。

Conclusion: 由于没有模型能达到完美准确性且检验结果差异很大，最有效和负责任的应用方式是人在循环系统，让LLM作为助手加速数据标注过程。

Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMPACT是一种联合剪枝方法，通过剪枝稀有词汇和基于常见词加权的FFN中间通道剪枝，在保持标准Transformer架构的同时实现高效模型压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使LLMs在内存、延迟和服务成本方面更高效，适用于边缘部署、交互式应用和大规模可持续推理。现有剪枝方法存在局限性：宽度剪枝破坏标准架构或需要定制推理代码，深度剪枝移除整个层导致精度骤降。

Method: 联合剪枝：(1)剪枝稀有词汇以缩小嵌入/解嵌入层，(2)使用常见词加权的激活值剪枝FFN中间通道，使重要性剪枝与剪枝后的词分布对齐。

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma系列模型(0.5B-70B)上实验显示，在相似或更高剪枝比例下达到最先进的下游任务性能，显著减少参数量、GPU内存和端到端延迟。

Conclusion: COMPACT兼具深度和宽度剪枝的优点：部署友好(保持标准架构)、规模适应性(词汇与FFN剪枝权衡)、无需训练的竞争性剪枝时间，以及强大的内存节省和吞吐量提升。

Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于文化的评估标准对于发展可信贵AI系统的重要性。EPT标准为评估模型在波斯文化背景下的可信贵性提供了专门工具，并公开了数据集以促进更进一步的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced
deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for
upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training
data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing
responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of
Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically
designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:
truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We
curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading
models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and
Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal
significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need
for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore,
our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with
Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities
for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is

Motivation: 现有的测试时计算扩展方法主要依赖简单多数投票或奖励模型排序，这些方法可能只能带来有限的性能提升。需要学习更智能的聚合策略来充分利用多个候选解决方案。

Method: 使用强化学习训练聚合模型，让模型学习审查、协调和综合多个候选解决方案以产生最终正确答案。关键是通过平衡难易训练样本来学习恢复少数但正确的答案。

Result: AggLM方法在多个基准测试中优于基于规则和奖励模型的基线方法，能有效泛化到不同模型的解决方案，包括比训练数据中更强的模型，同时比多数投票使用更少的token。

Conclusion: 将聚合作为显式推理技能学习是有效的，通过精心设计的强化学习训练，聚合模型能够智能地综合多个解决方案，显著提升大型语言模型在推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

Motivation: 当前缺乏针对编码器模型特别是多语言模型的最新研究，需要开发能够处理高资源和低资源语言的强大编码器模型

Method: 使用3T多语言文本训练，引入逆掩码比率调度和逆温度采样比率，在衰减阶段添加1700多种低资源语言数据

Result: 在分类和检索任务上显著超越前代模型，在低资源语言和高资源语言上都表现出色，性能与OpenAI o3和Google Gemini 2.5 Pro相当

Conclusion: 通过创新的训练策略和数据调度方法，mmBERT证明了编码器模型在多语言处理中的强大潜力，特别是在低资源语言上的优异表现

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar
classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous
generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and
low-resource languages.

Result: 形式化了PCN协议并证明了其健壮性、完备性、故障关闭行为和策略精细化的单调性，该方法轻量且模型无关

Conclusion: PCN通过将验证放在渲染器层而非模型层，建立了一种简单的合约机制：只有通过证明才能获得信任，而缺少标记则传递不确定性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

### [229] [Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948)
*Liang Chen,Xueting Han,Li Shen,Jing Bai,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双层优化的新方法，将监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)结合训练，通过条件化SFT目标来指导RL优化过程，在五个推理基准上取得了更好的效果和效率平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的两阶段方法(SFT预热后RL训练)限制了SFT和RL之间的交互，影响了整体效果。RL虽然能激励大语言模型的推理能力，但其试错性质导致效率低下。

Method: 使用双层优化框架：下层执行RL更新并同时接收SFT监督，上层显式最大化协作增益(联合训练相比单独RL的性能优势)。通过将SFT目标条件化于最优RL策略，使SFT能够元学习如何指导RL的优化过程。

Result: 在五个推理基准上的实证评估表明，该方法始终优于基线方法，并在效果和效率之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的双层优化方法能够促进SFT和RL训练范式之间更好的协作，通过条件化SFT目标来指导RL优化，显著提升了推理模型的学习效果和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceRL是一个轨迹感知的强化学习框架，用于扩散语言模型的后训练，通过扩散价值模型提升训练稳定性，在数学推理和编程任务上表现优异，并推出了TraDo系列模型，在多个基准测试中超越同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散语言模型在复杂推理任务上仍有提升空间，需要一种能够整合偏好推理轨迹的后训练框架来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出TraceRL框架，采用扩散基的价值模型增强训练稳定性，支持课程学习，并可应用于不同架构的扩散语言模型。

Result: TraDo-4B-Instruct在数学推理任务上持续超越7B规模的自回归模型；TraDo-8B-Instruct在数学推理基准上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升6.1%，相对Llama3.1-8B-Instruct提升51.3%；首个长链推理DLM在MATH500上相对Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct提升18.1%。

Conclusion: TraceRL框架有效提升了扩散语言模型的推理能力，推出的TraDo系列模型在多个任务上达到state-of-the-art性能，并开源了完整的训练和推理框架。

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for
diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference
trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different
architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances
training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex
math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific
models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing
TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still
consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.
TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first
long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%
relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical
applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,
training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The
framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for
both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of
various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and
general tasks. Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过Wavelength游戏框架评估语言模型的语用理解能力，发现大型模型在语言理解上接近人类水平，而CoT提示和RSA方法能显著提升语言生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型的语用理解能力，理解其在交际中的语用理解和语用推理能力。

Method: 使用Wavelength游戏框架，采用直接提示、思维链(CoT)提示和理性语言行为(RSA)方法，对不同规模的语言模型进行语言理解和语言生成的对比研究。

Result: 现有最先进的大型语言模型在语言理解任务上达到了类似于人类的准确率，与人类判断呈现高相关性，而在语言生成任务上，CoT提示和RSA方法能够显著提高模型的表现。

Conclusion: 研究呈现了语言模型在语用理解方面的强项和局限性，并证明了RSA方法在提升模型语用理解能力方面的潜力，为进一步研究概念表征、语言理解和社会理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language
understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

caused by the choice of tokenization strategy.

Conclusion: 感知图模型为增强现实系统提供了一种有效的方法来识别和对抗认知攻击，有助于提升战术环境中的人机交互安全性。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical
environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes
them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and
severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human
perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the
human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then
representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We
demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the
level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for
detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management, yet
progress in predictive tasks -- such as delivery delay prediction -- remains
constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, openly available datasets.
Existing datasets are often proprietary, small, or inconsistently maintained,
hindering reproducibility and benchmarking. We present SynDelay, a synthetic
dataset designed for delivery delay prediction. Generated using an advanced
generative model trained on real-world data, SynDelay preserves realistic
delivery patterns while ensuring privacy. Although not entirely free of noise
or inconsistencies, it provides a challenging and practical testbed for
advancing predictive modelling. To support adoption, we provide baseline
results and evaluation metrics as initial benchmarks, serving as reference
points rather than state-of-the-art claims. SynDelay is publicly available
through the Supply Chain Data Hub, an open initiative promoting dataset sharing
and benchmarking in supply chain AI. We encourage the community to contribute
datasets, models, and evaluation practices to advance research in this area.

Result: 验证了MVRS数据集的质量和情感可分离性，为多模态情感计算提供了价值购献。

Conclusion: MVRS数据集有力地补充了多模态情感识别领域的数据空白，推动了该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Automatic emotion recognition has become increasingly important with the rise
of AI, especially in fields like healthcare, education, and automotive systems.
However, there is a lack of multimodal datasets, particularly involving body
motion and physiological signals, which limits progress in the field. To
address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings
from 13 participants aged 12 to 60 exposed to VR based emotional stimuli
(relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Data were collected using eye
tracking (via webcam in a VR headset), body motion (Kinect v2), and EMG and GSR
signals (Arduino UNO), all timestamp aligned. Participants followed a unified
protocol with consent and questionnaires. Features from each modality were
extracted, fused using early and late fusion techniques, and evaluated with
classifiers to confirm the datasets quality and emotion separability, making
MVRS a valuable contribution to multimodal affective computing.

TL;DR: 本研究对GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5三种先进大语言模型在个性化学习辅导任务中的表现进行了实证比较，发现GPT-4o在生成反馈信息方面表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型越来越多地被设想为个性化学习的智能助手，但在真实学习场景中的系统性对比评估仍然有限，需要实证研究来验证不同模型在个性化学习任务中的表现。

Method: 使用包含学生答案和正确性标签的数据集，要求每个LLM完成三个任务：分析测验识别知识组件、推断学生掌握情况、生成针对性指导。采用Gemini作为虚拟评判者进行多维度两两比较，并使用Bradley-Terry模型分析结果。

Result: GPT-4o总体上更受青睐，生成的反馈信息更丰富、结构更好；DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5在某些方面有优势但一致性较低。

Conclusion: 研究证明了将LLMs部署为高级教学助手进行个性化支持的可行性，并为未来LLM驱动的个性化学习实证研究提供了方法指导。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These
tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived
from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface
enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate
SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate
accurate scattering data, and fit experimental datasets with high precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示工程方法将优化视为黑盒问题，缺乏对优化景观拓扑结构的理解，需要系统分析提示工程的适应度景观结构。

Method: 使用语义嵌入空间的自相关分析，在错误检测任务上比较两种提示生成策略：系统枚举（1024个提示）和新颖性驱动的多样化生成（1000个提示）。

Result: 发现系统提示生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，多样化生成显示非单调模式，在中间语义距离处具有峰值相关性，表明存在崎岖的分层结构景观。不同错误类型显示出不同程度的崎岖性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解提示工程优化景观的复杂性提供了实证基础，揭示了不同提示生成策略产生的根本不同的景观拓扑结构。

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric
codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new
agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements
official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that
can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best
performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative
classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are
limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system
performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically
undercoded).

TL;DR: 论文提出了Alignment Gap概念，统一解释RLHF等对齐方法的失败模式（奖励攻击、奉承等），通过KL倾斜形式化说明优化压力导致代理奖励与人类意图偏离，并提出了对齐三难困境和MAPS框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）和相关方法虽然有效，但存在重复的失败模式，需要统一的理论框架来理解这些对齐失败的根本原因。

Method: 采用KL倾斜形式化分析，将失败模式分类为AI对齐的墨菲定律，提出对齐三难困境理论框架，并通过小规模实证研究进行验证。

Result: 建立了Alignment Gap概念，系统化了对齐失败的模式分类，提出了MAPS框架作为实践设计杠杆，为对齐方法提供了结构性限制和权衡的新视角。

Conclusion: 论文不是提出不可能定理，而是提供了一个重构对齐辩论的视角，围绕结构性限制和权衡，为未来设计提供更清晰的指导。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

Motivation: 解决传统街道设计渲染方案刻画苦经苦的问题，提高公众参与主动交通规划的效率，并克服现有AI生成方法需要大量领域数据和难以实现精确空间变化的限制。

Method: 构建多模态多代理人系统，集成车道定位、提示优化、设计生成和自动评估四个模块，直接在真实街道图像上编辑自行车设施。

Result: 系统在多样化城市场景中都能适应不同道路几何形状和环境条件，一致生成视觉一致且符合指令要求的结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为应用多代理人流水线到交通基础设施规划和设施设计领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

Result: 在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于transformer基线(1.3%)、Grok-4(15.9%)和SOAR(52%)，仅使用150万参数。消融研究表明边缘投影是最关键组件。

Conclusion: TreeGPT成功结合了transformer和图神经网络的优点，为程序合成任务提供了一种高效且强大的架构，特别适合处理层次化树结构数据。

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

*Ruixun Liu,Lingyu Kong,Derun Li,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OccVLA是一个创新的多模态框架，将3D占据表示集成到统一推理过程中，无需显式3D输入即可实现精细空间理解，在自动驾驶任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在3D空间理解方面存在不足，主要因为缺乏大规模3D视觉语言预训练和难以构建有效的3D表示。这限制了自动驾驶等需要精确空间感知的应用。

Method: 提出OccVLA框架，将密集3D占据既作为预测输出又作为监督信号，直接从2D视觉输入学习精细空间结构。占据预测在推理时可跳过而不影响性能，不增加计算开销。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中达到轨迹规划的最先进结果，在3D视觉问答任务上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: OccVLA提供了一个可扩展、可解释且完全基于视觉的自动驾驶解决方案，成功解决了3D空间理解的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for
autonomous driving.

Motivation: 城市道路网络的异质性和层次性特征给准确表示学习带来挑战，传统图神经网络因同质性假设和单尺度结构关注而难以有效处理

Method: 使用空间流卷积从轨迹数据提取小尺度特征，识别尺度依赖的空间交互区域，通过图变换器捕获多尺度复杂空间依赖，采用残差连接融合特征并结合对比学习算法

Conclusion: 该研究为开发任务无关的道路网络表示模型提供了实用框架，揭示了尺度效应与空间交互流异质性之间的独特关联模式

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

Conclusion: CogEdit基准和MIND框架为多模态大语言模型的元认知知识编辑能力提供了有效的评估和改进方法，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 双曲几何为LLMs提供了一种有效的表示空间，能够更好地模型层次结构数据的内在语义关系，具有广阔的应用前景和研究潜力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,

Experiments show that DRF significantly improves task completion quality and

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合自动特征工程（AFE）和决策聚焦学习（DFL）的桌面，用于解决电池能量存储系统（BESS）优化中的数据稀缺和变异性问题，在实际数据集上实现了更低的运营成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源管理中的不确定性参数导膴优化策略困难，传统预测-优化分离方法存在错误传播问题，而新兴的DFL方法在实际应用中面临数据稀缺和变异性挑战。

Method: 提出AFE-DFL桌面，通过自动特征工程提取更丰富的数据表征，在小数据集上实现电价和需求预测的同时优化BESS运作以最小化成本。

Result: 在英国实际房屋数据集上验证，DFL方法比PTO方法平均运营成本更低，加入AFE后让DFL性能提升22.9-56.5%。

Conclusion: 结果为DFL在实际应用中的可行性提供了实证，领域特定的AFE能够增强DFL效果，减少对领域专业知识的依赖，并产生经济效益。

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者需要具备必要的知识来积极参与自己的护理过程，因此需要开发能够促进患者理解的对话AI系统。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在合成生成的医疗对话数据上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习（基于PPO）在模拟医院出院场景中进行训练，奖励信号来自患者理解评估。

Result: NoteAid-Chatbot展现出关键的新兴行为（清晰性、相关性和结构化对话），在图灵测试中超越非专家人类表现，证明即使简单的PPO奖励建模也能成功训练轻量级领域专用聊天机器人。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了将低成本、基于PPO的强化学习应用于现实开放域对话的可行性和前景，拓宽了基于RL的对齐方法的适用性，虽然当前聚焦医疗领域但具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

Conclusion: MapAgent的分层设计有效降低了认知负载，提高了工具选择准确性，实现了跨相似API的精确协调，为地理空间推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at

Motivation: 现有的基于规则的奖励函数只评估答案格式和正确性，无法判断思维链是否真正改进答案，且任务特定训练对逻辑深度的控制有限

Method: DRER框架包含：(i)推理质量奖励-对提升正确答案概率的推理链给予细粒度奖励；(ii)动态长度优势-对偏离验证阈值的响应长度进行优势衰减。使用Logictree数据集进行训练和评估

Result: 7B模型在400训练步后达到GPT-o3-mini水平，思维链增强答案的平均置信度提升30%，在多种逻辑推理数据集和AIME24数学基准上表现出泛化能力

Conclusion: DRER有效塑造了思维链行为，为增强大语言模型的形式推理能力提供了实用路径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are

Conclusion: REER为开放创意生成中的深度推理提供了一种有效的新范式，通过反向工程方法成功解决了传统方法的局限性，并在性能上取得了显著成果。

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Method: 提出EDIT方法，采用约束引导生成，同时跟踪长度和答案分布，动态选择在简洁性和正确性之间达到最优平衡的推理路径

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，EDIT显著提高了推理效率，产生紧凑且信息丰富的输出，改善了可读性和用户体验

Conclusion: EDIT通过测试时缩放有效解决了LRMs的过度思考问题，在保持正确性的同时实现了更高效的推理过程

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

*Manvi Jha,Jiaxin Wan,Deming Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proof2Silicon是一个端到端的硬件合成框架，通过PREFACE的强化学习提示优化生成可验证的Dafny代码，然后自动转换为C代码并最终合成RTL硬件，在100个任务基准测试中实现了高达72%的端到端硬件合成成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现出色，但生成的代码经常无法通过形式化验证，这在硬件和安全关键领域是基本要求。需要一种能够生成形式化验证正确代码的方法。

Method: 1) 使用PREFACE的验证器驱动RL代理迭代优化提示生成，确保Dafny代码正确性；2) 通过Dafny的Python后端和PyLog将验证后的Dafny程序自动转换为可合成的高级C代码；3) 使用Vivado HLS生成RTL实现。

Result: 在100个任务的基准测试中，PREFACE的RL引导提示优化将不同LLM的Dafny验证成功率提高了高达21%。Proof2Silicon实现了高达72%的端到端硬件合成成功率。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一个稳健、可扩展且自动化的流水线，用于LLM驱动的形式化验证硬件合成，连接了自然语言规范和硅实现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language
specification and silicon realization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前个性化AI助手难以整合复杂的个人数据和因果知识，导致建议过于通用且缺乏解释性。

Method: 使用个人因果图谱记录用户生活事件和习惯，通过目标导向的因果遍历、外部知识增强和假设推理，结合可适配的计划模式生成定制化行动方案，由大语言模型协调各组件。

Result: 基于CSM的智能体相比基线LLM智能体能提供更具上下文感知和用户对齐的推荐，在个性化和可解释性评估指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了在个性化智能体中实现记忆增强和因果推理的新方法，推动了透明可信赖的AI生活方式助手的发展。

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal
data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice that lacks explanatory
power. We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal
lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal
reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module. The idea is to deliver
explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in
personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy
AI lifestyle assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本方法在复杂数值计算方面存在困难，工具集成方法缺乏真正的自主适应性，需要开发能够自主进行多步推理和精确计算的表格推理系统。

Method: 采用两阶段微调范式：先在高质量推理轨迹上进行监督微调建立工具使用模式，然后通过强化微调优化多目标策略，提出Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO)方法提升高质量轨迹的更新权重。

Result: 在多个主流基准测试中，TableMind相比竞争基线实现了优越性能，在推理准确性和计算精度方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: TableMind通过自主工具调用、代码执行和自反思能力，结合创新的两阶段微调方法，为表格推理任务提供了有效的解决方案，在准确性和精度方面表现出色。

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的推理方法依赖隐式探索，导致推理路径不稳定、缺乏错误修正能力且无法从经验中学习，需要更结构化的推理方法

Method: 从成功轨迹中提取结构化推理模式，从失败中提取反思信号；在推理时逐步遵循指导原则，每一步后进行精炼以修正错误和稳定推理过程

Result: 在BBH、GSM8K、MATH-500、MBPP、HumanEval等基准测试中一致优于强基线，提升推理稳定性和泛化能力

Conclusion: 结构化推理通过逐步执行和精炼机制有效改善推理质量，指导原则具有良好的跨领域迁移能力和跨模型协作灵活性，在效果和可扩展性上达到或超过监督微调

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

TL;DR: 评估7个大型语言模型在住宅能源改造决策中的表现，发现LLMs在技术目标上表现更好，但需要提高准确性、一致性和上下文处理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统能源改造决策方法通用性有限且可解释性低，阻碍了在多样化住宅环境中的采用。随着智能社区和生成式AI的发展，LLMs可能通过处理上下文信息来提供可读建议

Method: 评估7个LLMs（ChatGPT、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Llama和Claude）在住宅改造决策中的表现，使用包含49个州400个住宅的数据集，从准确性、一致性、敏感性和推理四个维度进行评估

Result: LLMs在许多情况下能生成有效建议，未微调情况下达到54.5%的top 1匹配率和92.8%的top 5匹配率。技术目标表现更强，模型间一致性低，对位置和建筑几何形状敏感

Conclusion: LLMs在能源改造决策中是有前景的助手，但需要在准确性、一致性和上下文处理方面进行改进才能可靠应用

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM驱动的调查模拟建立了严格基础，为社会学研究和政策评估提供了可扩展且成本效益高的工具。

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated
pipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in

environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement
decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level
mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint
system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament

DiagCoT combines contrastive image-report tuning for domain alignment,
chain-of-thought supervision to capture inferential logic, and reinforcement
tuning with clinical reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and fluency. On

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文任务时面临'中间信息丢失'问题，现有方法要么可能丢弃关键信息，要么导致注意力分散。

Method: TOA框架将输入分段由独立智能体处理，每个智能体生成局部认知，然后通过树状结构路径动态交换信息进行协作推理，并采用前缀哈希缓存和自适应剪枝策略提高效率。

Conclusion: TOA框架通过多智能体协作推理有效缓解了位置偏见和幻觉问题，在保持可比较API开销的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

Motivation: 集中式RAG系统在处理异构和隐私敏感的医疗数据时面临困难，特别是在分布式医疗环境中，患者数据分散在SQL、知识图谱和临床文档等多种格式中，且存在隐私约束和边缘设备处理能力限制的问题。

Method: 设计了基于Flower的边缘-云协作RAG框架，边缘侧LLM将异构数据转换为标准化隐私保护表示，服务器侧LLM进行全局推理和生成；集成了轻量级本地检索器和隐私感知LLM，提供三种匿名化工具；设计了三层缓存策略优化响应延迟。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构化异构数据上的RAG提供了可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案，在敏感和多样化数据环境中释放了LLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在下游任务中的应用需求增长，提高模型对齐性能和效率变得至关重要。但由于指令集分布的复杂性，当前方法在指令池不断扩展时无法持续提升性能。

Method: 首先研究指令数据集分布与对齐模型性能关系的关键因素，发现指令深度和语义空间覆盖是决定性因素。然后设计指令选择算法同时最大化所选指令的深度和语义覆盖。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进的基线方法，该方法能以更快的速度持续提升模型性能，实现"加速扩展"，能够解释开发集上超过70%的模型损失。

Conclusion: 指令深度和语义覆盖是影响对齐模型性能的关键因素，提出的指令选择方法能够有效提高模型在下游任务中的表现和效率。

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

TL;DR: MAS-Bench是一个用于评估GUI-快捷方式混合智能体的基准测试，专注于移动领域，包含139个复杂任务和88个预定义快捷方式，旨在填补混合智能体系统化评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统化评估GUI操作与快捷方式（如API、深度链接）混合智能体的框架，需要建立一个基准来推动更高效智能代理的发展。

Method: 构建包含139个跨11个真实应用复杂任务的基准，提供88个预定义快捷方式知识库，设计7个评估指标，测试智能体自主生成快捷方式和创建可重用工作流的能力。

Result: 实验显示混合智能体相比纯GUI操作智能体具有显著更高的成功率和效率，证明了评估方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MAS-Bench填补了关键评估空白，为创建更高效、鲁棒的智能代理提供了基础平台，推动了混合智能体领域的发展。

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

TL;DR: 重强化学习与多目标进化算法相结合，提出了一种动态多目标优化方法，通过MOEAs搜索策略空间生成帕索托前沿，并采用CVaR结构提高风险敏感性，在供应链管理中显著提升了决策效率和遭需能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理中常需在成本、服务水平和环境可持续性等多个相互冲突的目标之间取得平衡。传统多目标优化方法难以实时适应动态环境的挑战。

Method: 结合重强化学习(RL)和多目标进化算法(MOEAs)，利用MOEAs搜索策略神经网络的参数空间，生成帕索托前沿策略集。引入条件风险价值(CVaR)支持风险敏感决策。

Result: 通过案例研究验证了方法的有效性，能够响应供应链动态变化，在库存管理案例中超过了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该策略不仅提高了决策效率，还提供了更健壮的框架来管理不确定性和优化供应链性能。

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

TL;DR: BFS-Prover-V2是一个解决LLM在定理证明中训练和推理双重扩展问题的系统，通过多轮离线RL框架和规划增强的多智能体搜索架构，在形式数学基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自动定理证明中面临训练时强化学习和推理时计算扩展的双重挑战，需要克服性能平台期和搜索空间过大的问题

Method: 1) 多轮离线RL框架：受AlphaZero启发，采用多阶段专家迭代流程，包含自适应战术级数据过滤和定期重训练；2) 规划增强的多智能体搜索架构：使用通用推理模型作为高级规划器，将复杂定理分解为简单子目标，通过共享证明缓存实现并行证明智能体协作

Conclusion: 该方法不仅在形式数学领域有效，其RL和推理技术对需要长视野多轮推理和复杂搜索的其他领域也具有广泛适用性

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated

methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed
methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that
outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting
COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大模型在复杂跨模态推理中存在的"短接"问题和上下文理解不足问题，提高模型的认知理解能力。

Method: 设计了一个插拔式三模块流水线（意图感知器、策略生成器、策略选择器），显式构建"理解-规划-选择"的认知过程，通过生成和筛选"意图草笼"策略来指导最终推理。

Result: 在IntentBench、WorldSense和Daily-Omni数据集上验证了方法的普遍性和稳健性，相比各自基线完整的"三模块"方案在不同推理引擎和流水线组合中均实现了一致提升，最高提升约9.51个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法无需参数微调，仅通过上下文工程实现跨模型转移，信息论分析显示其能够降低条件熵与并提高信息利用效率，压制意外的短接推理，在零检验场景中具有实用价值和可移植性。

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

<details>

Motivation: 传统函数调用方法在智能车辆座舱这种复杂环境中存在效率低下和错误恢复能力有限的问题，需要探索性调用来构建环境认知。

Method: 开发了包含30个模块、250个API和680个属性的VehicleWorld环境，并提出SFC方法，通过维护显式系统状态感知和直接状态转换来实现目标条件。

Result: 实验结果表明SFC方法显著优于传统函数调用方法，在执行准确性和延迟减少方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 直接状态预测比函数调用更适合环境控制任务，SFC方法为车辆座舱智能代理提供了更高效的解决方案，所有实现代码已在Github开源。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个用于评估大语言模型迭代精细化能力的框架，通过控制12轮对话测试代码、数学和思想创造任务，发现不同领域的迭代效果差异显著，并确定了有效指导迭代的具体策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型已经被广泛用于多轮工作流程，但目前仍缺乏明确的方法来评估迭代精细化在什么情况下有帮助、什么情况下可能有害，需要一个统一的评估框架来量化分析迭代效果。

Method: 研究设计了一个控制性评估协议，每个任务进行12轮对话。使用从模糊"改进它"反馈到有目标导向的各种提示词，记录每轮输出。采用领域适应性检查进行评分（代码用单元测试，数学用答案等效性加推理合理性，思想创造用原创性和可行性），并通过三类指标跟踪每轮行为：语义移动、轮间变化和输出大小增长。

Result: 研究发现迭代收益具有明显领域依赖性：思想创造和代码在早期轮次即有收益，而数学在后期轮次才显示重要作用（特别是在详细解释指导下）。在前几轮之后，模糊反馈常导致水平化或正确性倒退，而有目标的提示能可靠地改善指定质量轴（思想创造中的新颖性vs可行性；代码中的速度vs可读性；数学中详细解释超过探索并为后期带来收益）。同时观察到一致的领域模式：思想创造在轮次间语义变化更大，代码输出大小增长但语义变化小，数学初始固定但可通过后期详细迭代突破这一路径。

Conclusion: 这个评估框架和指标体系使得迭代过程可以被量化和在不同模型间进行比较，并为何时应该指导、停止或切换策略提供了信号。这为优化LLM在多轮工作流程中的迭代精细化能力提供了重要的工具和见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理系统的评估方法存在局限，难以识别长时程多组件系统中的故障点和原因，需要能够推理、探测、迭代和理解复杂逻辑的评估框架。

Method: RAFFLES采用迭代式多组件流水线架构，包含一个中央Judge系统性地调查故障，以及一组专门Evaluators评估系统组件和Judge自身的推理质量，建立假设历史。

Result: 在Who&When数据集上，RAFFLES在算法生成数据集上达到43%以上的代理-步骤故障对准确率（从之前最佳的16.6%大幅提升），在手工制作数据集上超过20%（超越之前最佳的8.8%）。

Conclusion: RAFFLES代表了向自主系统自动化故障检测迈出的关键一步，有望替代劳动密集型的人工审查。

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过综合评估发现，在知识密集任务中，测试时扩展算力并不能持续提高准确性，反而可能导致更多幻觉错误，但使用思考仍比不思考更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估测试时扩展算力在知识密集任务中的效果，因为这类任务需要高事实准确性和低幻觉率，而当前的方法在其他领域表现良好但在知识密集任务中的效果不明确。

Method: 使用12个推理模型在2个知识密集测试集上进行综合评估，分析测试时扩展算力对准确性和幻觉行为的影响，包括案例研究。

Result: 增加测试时计算并不能持续提高准确性，反而在许多情况下导致更多幻觉；减少幻觉通常是模型选择避免回答，而非改善事实记忆；更长的推理可能引起确认偏见，导致过于自信的幻觉。

Conclusion: 虽然测试时扩展算力在知识密集任务中存在限制，但使用思考仍然比不思考更有益，需要更深入研究如何在这类任务中有效利用扩展计算。

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Conclusion: Paper2Agent将静态论文转化为动态AI代理，为知识传播和AI协作生态系统奠定了基础新范式。

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了计算成本高和需要离线调整的问题，显著提升了模型的生成质量

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

Abstract: In this work we consider, in a Banach space framework, the regularization of
linear ill-posed problems. Our focus is on the recovery of solutions that have
a logarithmic source representation. Such cases typically occur in
exponentially ill-posed problems like the backwards heat equation. The
mathematical framework on logarithms of operators is provided, and convergence
rates for a class of parametric regularization schemes are deduced. This class
includes the iterated version of Lavrentiev's method and the method of the
abstract Cauchy problem. The presentation includes both a priori and a
posteriori parameter choice strategies. Finally, we present an example for a
logarithmic source representable function with respect to the integration
operator.

Abstract: In this work we present a variant of the fast multipole method (FMM) for
efficiently evaluating standard layer potentials on geometries with complex
coordinates in two and three dimensions. The complex scaled boundary integral
method for the efficient solution of scattering problems on unbounded domains
results in complex point locations upon discretization. Classical
real-coordinate FMMs are no longer applicable, hindering the use of this
approach for large-scale problems. Here we develop the complex-coordinate FMM
based on the analytic continuation of certain special function identities used
in the construction of the classical FMM. To achieve the same linear time
complexity as the classical FMM, we construct a hierarchical tree based solely
on the real parts of the complex point locations, and derive convergence rates
for truncated expansions when the imaginary parts of the locations are a
Lipschitz function of the corresponding real parts. We demonstrate the
efficiency of our approach through several numerical examples and illustrate
its application for solving large-scale time-harmonic water wave problems and
Helmholtz transmission problems.

Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity numerical simulations in soil-structure
interaction analysis is on the rise, yet a standardized workflow to guide the
creation of such simulations remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this
gap by presenting a step-by-step guideline proposing a workflow for dynamic
analysis of structures with pile foundations. The proposed workflow encompasses
instructions on how to use Domain Reduction Method for loading, Perfectly
Matched Layer elements for wave absorption, soil-structure interaction modeling
using Embedded interface elements, and domain decomposition for efficient use
of processing units. Through a series of numerical simulations, we showcase the
practical application of this workflow. Our results reveal the efficacy of the
Domain Reduction Method in reducing simulation size without compromising model
fidelity, show the precision of Perfectly Matched Layer elements in modeling
infinite domains, highlight the efficiency of Embedded Interface elements in
establishing connections between structures and the soil domain, and
demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the proposed workflow in conducting
high-fidelity simulations. While our study focuses on simplified geometries and
loading scenarios, it serves as a foundational framework for future research
endeavors aimed at exploring more intricate structural configurations and
dynamic loading conditions

Abstract: This paper presents a discretization framework for high-order staggered
Lagrangian hydrodynamics, bridging two well-established algorithms algorithms:
high-order curvilinear finite element Lagrangian hydrodynamics [Dobrev et al.
2012] and compatible hydrodynamics methods[Caramana et al.1998]. We emphasizes
the critical relationship between the degrees of freedom (DOFs) associated with
the density variable and the choice of numerical quadrature rules which is
employed in the mass conservation law. The precise quadrature rule will lead
the consistency issues arising from the density and internal energy variables
being defined at different physical points. Our approach resolves this by
unifying the quadrature rule for the specific discretization space, though this
inevitably introduces hourglass distortion. Another key feature of the proposed
framework is the strategic arrangement of DOFs for kinematic and thermodynamic
variables, which enhances computational efficiency and leads to diagonal mass
matrices in the momentum and energy equations. Finally, we present a smooth
numerical example that validate the accuracy of the proposed high-order
Lagrangian hydrodynamics framework.

Abstract: Residual smoothing techniques, which produce a smooth convergence behavior of
linear iterative solvers, also form connections between different methods. For
example, minimal residual smoothing can transform the residuals of the
conjugate gradient (CG) method into those of the conjugate residual (CR) method
for linear systems with symmetric matrices. In this study, we investigate
whether a similar relationship can be constructed between the Bi-CG and Bi-CR
methods for nonsymmetric linear systems. Numerical experiments regarding the
aforementioned connection demonstrate the validity of our insights.

Abstract: Neural stochastic differential equation model with a Brownian motion term can
capture epistemic uncertainty of deep neural network from the perspective of a
dynamical system. The goal of this paper is to improve the convergence rate of
the sample-wise backpropagation algorithm in neural stochastic differential
equation model which has been proposed in [Archibald et al., SIAM Journal on
Numerical Analysis, 62 (2024), pp. 593-621]. It is necessary to emphasize that,
improving the convergence order of the algorithm consisting of forward backward
stochastic differential equations remains challenging, due to the loss of
information of Z term in backward equations under sample-wise approximation and
the limitations of the forward network form. In this paper, we develop a
high-order backpropagation algorithm to improve the training accuracy. Under
the convexity assumption, the result indicates that the first-order convergence
is achieved when the number of training steps is proportional to the cubic
number of layers. Finally, numerical examples illustrate our theoretical
results.

Abstract: Implicit methods and GPU parallelization are two distinct yet powerful
strategies for accelerating high-order CFD algorithms. However, few studies
have successfully integrated both approaches within high-speed flow solvers.
The core challenge lies in preserving the robustness of implicit algorithms in
the presence of strong discontinuities, while simultaneously enabling massive
thread parallelism under the constraints of limited GPU memory. To address
this, we propose a GPU-optimized, geometric multigrid-accelerated, high-order
compact gas kinetic scheme (CGKS) that incorporates three key innovations:
  (1) a multi-color lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel scheme that eliminates
thread conflicts and preserves memory efficiency, serving as an implicit
smoother on coarse grids; (2) a discontinuity-adaptive relaxation technique and
a multigrid prolongation process, based on a discontinuous feedback factor,
which dynamically stabilize shock regions without compromising convergence in
smooth zones; and (3) a three-layer V-cycle geometric parallel multigrid
strategy specifically tailored for unstructured meshes. Extensive tests on
multi-dimensional subsonic to hypersonic flows demonstrate that our GPU-based
high-performance solver achieves one to two orders of magnitude faster
convergence compared to previous explicit solvers. More importantly, it
preserves the shock-capturing robustness of the explicit CGKS and exhibits
strong scalability on GPU architectures. This work presents a unified framework
that synergistically leverages implicit acceleration and GPU optimization for
high-speed flow simulations, effectively overcoming traditional trade-offs
between parallelism, memory constraints, and numerical stability in high-order
methods.

varifold. We then extend the results to the approximate second fundamental
form. Finally, we prove some additional comparison principles satisfied by the
motion of points cloud by mean curvature (in the discrete and the continuous
cases).

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a sequentially decoupled numerical method for
solving the fully coupled quasi-static thermo-poroelasticity problems with
nonlinear convective transport. The symmetric interior penalty discontinuous
Galerkin method is employed for spatial discretization and the backward Euler
method for temporal discretization. Unlike other splitting algorithms, this
type of sequential method does not require any internal iterations and the
computational efficiency is higher than that of the fully implicit nonlinear
numerical scheme. In the theoretical analysis, a cut-off operator is introduced
to prove the existence and uniqueness of numerical solution and the stability
analysis of numerical scheme is conducted. Then, we derive the optimal
convergence order estimates in space and time. Finally, several numerical
examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of our
proposed method.

Abstract: We introduce suitable coordinate systems for pipes and their variants that
allow us to transform partial differential equations (PDEs) on the pipe
surfaces or in the solid pipes into computational domains with fixed
limits/ranges. Such a notion is reminiscent of the polar and cylindrical
coordinates for their advantageous geometries. The new curvilinear coordinates
are non-orthogonal in two directions, so the Laplace--Beltrami operators
involve mixed derivatives. To deal with the variable coefficients arising from
coordinate transformations and diverse surface geometries, we develop efficient
fourth-order compact finite difference methods adaptable to various scenarios.
We then rigorously prove the convergence of the proposed method for some model
problem, and apply the solver to several other types of PDEs. We further
demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach with ample numerical
results. Here, we only consider the compact finite differences for the
transformed PDEs for simplicity, but one can employ the spectral-collocation
methods to efficiently handle such variable coefficient problems.

Abstract: We propose a novel fractal based interpolation scheme termed Rational Cubic
Trigonometric Zipper Fractal Interpolation Functions (RCTZFIFs) designed to
model and preserve the inherent geometric property, positivity, in given
datasets. The method employs a combination of rational cubic trigonometric
functions within a zipper fractal framework, offering enhanced flexibility
through shape parameters and scaling factors. Rigorous error analysis is
presented to establish the convergence of the proposed zipper fractal
interpolants to the underlying classical fractal functions, and subsequently,
to the data-generating function. We derive necessary constraints on the scaling
factors and shape parameters to ensure positivity preservation. By carefully
selecting the signature, shape parameters, and scaling factors within these
bounds, we construct a class of RCTZFIFs that effectively preserve the positive
nature of the data, as compared to a reference interpolant that may violate
this property. Numerical experiments and visualisations demonstrate the
efficacy and robustness of our approach in preserving positivity while offering
fractal flexibility.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于径向基函数插值的Crank-Nicolson型格式，用于线性抛物型偏微分方程的时间积分，在保持经典CN方法结构简单性的同时，通过形状参数优化实现更高阶时间精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典Crank-Nicolson方法虽然结构简单且无条件稳定，但只有二阶时间精度。需要开发既能保持CN方法优点又能获得更高精度的数值格式。

Method: 将径向基函数插值与CN方法结合，通过优化形状参数来提高时间精度。进行一致性分析和von Neumann稳定性分析，并采用Gauss-Legendre隐式Runge-Kutta方法进行初始化。

Result: RBF-CN格式至少具有二阶精度，通过简单选择形状参数可将精度提高两个数量级。稳定性条件与标准CN方法基本相同。数值实验显示在最优初始化下，精度与隐式Runge-Kutta方法相当，但计算成本降低近两个数量级。

Conclusion: 提出的RBF-CN格式成功地在保持CN方法结构简单性和稳定性的同时，显著提高了时间精度，计算效率远高于传统高阶方法，为抛物型PDE的高效数值求解提供了有前景的方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a class of Crank-Nicolson (CN) type schemes enhanced by
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for the time integration of linear
parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The resulting RBF-CN schemes
preserve the structural simplicity of the classical CN method while enabling
higher-order temporal accuracy through the optimization of the shape parameter.
Consistency analysis shows that the schemes are always at least second-order
accurate and a simple choice of the shape parameter increases the accuracy by
two orders over the standard CN scheme. Further optimization can reduce the
next leading error term to attain even higher-order accuracy. A von Neumann
stability analysis confirms that the stability conditions are essentially the
same as those of the standard CN scheme. Several numerical experiments in 1D
are carried out to verify the theoretical results under different boundary
conditions. Particular focus is given to the startup stage, where several
strategies for computing the initial steps are examined, and Gauss-Legendre
implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods are found to be the most effective. The
experiments further demonstrate that, with optimal initialization, the proposed
schemes deliver accuracy comparable to implicit Runge-Kutta methods while
achieving nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost.

Abstract: Particle-based stochastic approximations of the Boltzmann equation are
popular tools for simulations of non-equilibrium gas flows, for which the
Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations fail to provide accurate description. However,
these numerical methods are computationally demanding, especially in the
near-continuum regime, where the collisions become overwhelming. On the other
hand, the Fokker-Planck kinetic models offer an efficient alternative, as the
binary collisions are described by a diffusive process. Despite the intuitive
advantage, rigorous and efficient Fokker-Planck approximations of the Boltzmann
equation remain an open problem. On one hand, the moment projection of the
Fokker-Planck operator should be consistent with that of the Boltzmann
operator. On the other hand, the Fokker-Planck model should be constructed in
such a way that the H-theorem is satisfied. The central aim of this study is
fulfilling these two categorically different constraints, i.e. moment matching
and entropy dissipation, within a flexible and tractable Fokker-Planck
framework. To this end, we introduce a Fisher information-based entropic
constraint and demonstrate that, with a suitable polynomial expansion of the
drift term, it is possible to simultaneously achieve weak moment matching while
honouring the H-theorem. We support our theoretical result by numerical
experiments on the shock problem, validating our Fisher Entropic Fokker-Planck
framework.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a parallel solver for solving the quasi-static
linear poroelasticity coupled with linear elasticity model in the Lagrange
multiplier framework. Firstly, we reformulate the model into a coupling of the
nearly incompressible elasticity and an unsteady affection-diffusion equations
by setting new variable ``elastic pressure" and ``volumetric fluid content".
And we introduce a Lagrange multiplier to guarantee the normal stress
continuity on the interface. Then, we give the variational formulations in each
subdomain and choose the $\boldsymbol{P}_k$-$P_1$-$P_1$ mixed finite element
tuple for poroelasticity subdomain, and $\boldsymbol{P}_k$-$P_1$ finite element
pair ($k=1,2$) for elasticity subdomain and the backward Euler scheme for time.
Also, we propose a parallel solver for solving the fully discrete scheme at
each time step -- the FETI method with a classical FETI preconditioner for
solving the Lagrange multiplier and calculating the subproblems in each
subdomain in parallel. And we show several numerical tests to validate the
computational efficiency and the convergence error order, and we consider
Barry-Mercer's model as the benchmark test to show that there no oscillation in
the computed pressure. Finally, we draw conclusions to summarize the main

*Pablo Jiménez Recio,Marc Alexander Schweitzer*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 评估自适应和嵌套因子化稀疏近似逆在多层V循环中作为平滑器的性能，使用第四类切比雪夫迭代进行平滑处理，基于单位分解方法离散双调和三调和方程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏近似逆在多层V循环中作为平滑器的有效性，特别是在处理高阶偏微分方程离散化时

Method: 提出新的自适应算法构建稀疏近似逆，基于单位分解方法产生的矩阵块结构；提出更简单的第四类切比雪夫迭代公式；使用多层V循环和第四类切比雪夫迭代进行平滑

Result: 论文提出了新的自适应算法和简化迭代公式，但具体性能结果需要在完整论文中查看

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应稀疏近似逆构造算法和简化的第四类切比雪夫迭代公式为处理高阶偏微分方程的多层方法提供了有效工具

Abstract: In this paper, we assess the performance of adaptive and nested factorized
sparse approximate inverses as smoothers in multilevel V-cycles, when smoothing
is performed following the Chebyshev iteration of the fourth kind. For our test
problems, we rely on the partition of unity method to discretize the biharmonic
and triharmonic equations in a multilevel manner. Inspired by existing
algorithms, we introduce a new adaptive algorithm for the construction of
sparse approximate inverses, based on the block structure of matrices arising
in the partition of unity method. Additionally, we also present a new (and
arguably simpler) formulation of the Chebyshev iteration of the fourth kind.

### [297] [Standard vs. Modular Sampling: Best Practices for Reliable LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05316)
*Praveen Bushipaka,Lucia Passaro,Tommaso Cucinotta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统性评估LLM反学习中的常见实践，发现依赖单一邻近集和标准采样方法存在问题，并提出包含多样化邻近集和模块化实体级反学习策略的最佳实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM反学习研究中常见使用单一邻近集和标准采样方法，但这些方法的效果和稳定性未经过严格评估，且无法反映真实世界数据的复杂性和关系。

Method: 系统性评估现有常见实践，分析单一邻近集和不同采样方法的效果，并提出模块化实体级反学习(MELU)策略作为替代方案。

Result: 研究发现依赖单一邻近集是次优的，标准1:1采样方法效率低下且效果差，而提出的MELU策略给出了明确稳定的反学习路径。

Conclusion: 建议采用多样化邻近集来平衡反学习效果和模型效用，避免使用标准采样方法，并以模块化实体级反学习策略替代循环采样。

Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

### [298] [Feed Two Birds with One Scone: Exploiting Function-Space Regularization for Both OOD Robustness and ID Fine-Tuning Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05328)
*Xiang Yuan,Jun Shu,Deyu meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法，通过在函数空间中约束微调模型与预训练模型的距离，并使用模拟OOD样本来保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时通过一致性正则化进一步提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒微调方法（如保留预训练权重、特征或logits）不能总是提高不同模型架构的OOD鲁棒性，因为这些方法不能很好地代理函数空间中的优化。

Method: 提出函数空间距离约束正则化，使用模拟OOD样本来保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性；引入一致性正则化来促进扰动样本的稳定预测。

Result: 在多种CLIP骨干网络上，该方法能够一致地提高下游任务的ID微调性能和OOD鲁棒性，优于现有的基于正则化的鲁棒微调方法。

Conclusion: 通过在函数空间中直接约束模型距离并使用模拟OOD样本，可以更有效地保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

### [299] [Safeguarding Graph Neural Networks against Topology Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05429)
*Jie Fu,Hong Yuan,Zhili Chen,Wendy Hui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图神经网络中的拓扑隐私风险，提出了拓扑推理攻击(TIAs)并发现现有边级差分隐私机制不足，进而提出了保护拓扑隐私的新防御框架PGR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络(GNNs)的广泛应用引发了严重的隐私问题，现有研究主要关注边级隐私，但拓扑隐私(图整体结构的保密性)这一关键威胁尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了拓扑推理攻击(TIAs)来重建目标训练图结构，并引入了Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR)防御框架，采用双层优化方法，通过元梯度迭代生成合成训练图，同时基于演化图更新GNN模型。

Result: 研究发现GNNs对这些攻击高度脆弱，现有边级差分隐私机制要么无法缓解风险，要么严重损害模型准确性。PGR框架显著减少了拓扑泄漏，同时对模型准确性的影响最小。

Conclusion: 拓扑隐私是GNNs中一个严重但被忽视的威胁，需要专门的防御机制。PGR框架为保护图结构隐私提供了有效解决方案，在保持模型性能的同时增强了隐私保护。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning
from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised
serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on
edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology
privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing
their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a
suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure
of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our
findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that
existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they
either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To
address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a
novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining
model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a
synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the
GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with
minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is anonymously available at
https://github.com/JeffffffFu/PGR.

### [300] [Neural Breadcrumbs: Membership Inference Attacks on LLMs Through Hidden State and Attention Pattern Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05449)
*Disha Makhija,Manoj Ghuhan Arivazhagan,Vinayshekhar Bannihatti Kumar,Rashmi Gangadharaiah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了memTrace框架，通过分析LLM内部表示（隐藏状态和注意力模式）而非仅输出，来检测训练数据成员身份，在MIA基准测试中达到0.85的平均AUC分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明成员推理攻击对大型语言模型效果有限，但作者认为仅分析模型输出可能忽略了内部表示中的隐私泄露信号，需要从模型内部行为角度重新评估隐私风险。

Method: 提出memTrace框架，分析transformer隐藏状态和注意力模式的"神经痕迹"，包括层级表示动态、注意力分布特征和跨层转移模式，检测传统基于损失的方法可能遗漏的记忆指纹。

Result: 在多个模型家族上实现了强大的成员检测能力，在流行的MIA基准测试中平均AUC分数达到0.85，表明内部模型行为能揭示训练数据暴露情况。

Conclusion: 即使输出信号看似安全，内部模型行为仍可能泄露隐私信息，强调需要进一步研究成员隐私问题，开发更强大的隐私保护训练技术。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

### [301] [Calibrated Recommendations with Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05460)
*Diego Feijer,Himan Abdollahpouri,Sanket Gupta,Alexander Clare,Yuxiao Wen,Todd Wasson,Maria Dimakopoulou,Zahra Nazari,Kyle Kretschman,Mounia Lalmas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spotify提出基于上下文多臂老虎机的校准方法，根据用户上下文动态学习最优内容类型分布，解决了历史数据偏向音乐内容的问题，提升了用户参与度和非音乐内容的曝光。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spotify首页包含多种内容类型，但历史数据严重偏向音乐内容，难以提供平衡的个性化内容组合。用户对不同内容类型的偏好会随上下文（时间、设备等）变化，需要动态调整内容分布。

Method: 使用上下文多臂老虎机方法，基于用户上下文和偏好动态学习每个用户的最优内容类型分布，而不是依赖历史平均值。

Result: 离线和在线实验结果显示，该方法提高了Spotify首页的推荐精度和用户参与度，特别是对播客等代表性不足的内容类型有显著改善。

Conclusion: 基于上下文多臂老虎机的校准方法能够有效适应用户兴趣在不同上下文中的变化，提升内容推荐的平衡性和个性化效果。

Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music,
podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward
music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content
mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary
depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We
propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically
learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and
preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical
averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in
different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results
demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page,
in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.

### [302] [PLanTS: Periodicity-aware Latent-state Representation Learning for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05478)
*Jia Wang,Xiao Wang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLanTS是一个周期性感知的自监督学习框架，通过多粒度分块机制和状态转换预测任务，有效解决了多元时间序列的高维度和标签稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列存在高维度、标签数据有限和非平稳性等挑战，现有自监督学习方法忽略了内在周期性结构，无法捕捉潜在状态的动态演化。

Method: 提出周期性感知的多粒度分块机制和广义对比损失，设计下一状态转换预测任务，在多个时间分辨率下保持实例级和状态级相似性。

Result: 在多种下游任务（多分类、多标签分类、预测、轨迹跟踪和异常检测）中表现优于现有自监督学习方法，且比基于DTW的方法具有更好的运行时效率。

Conclusion: PLanTS框架通过显式建模周期性结构和状态转换，显著提升了多元时间序列的表征质量，为相关领域提供了有效的自监督学习解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

### [303] [STL-based Optimization of Biomolecular Neural Networks for Regression and Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05481)
*Eric Palanques-Tost,Hanna Krasowski,Murat Arcak,Ron Weiss,Calin Belta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用信号时序逻辑(STL)规范来训练生物分子神经网络(BNNs)，解决了BNNs缺乏目标数据的训练挑战，实现了回归和控制任务的生物系统应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物分子神经网络具有通用函数逼近能力，但由于缺乏目标数据，训练BNNs仍然具有挑战性

Method: 基于STL的定量语义，开发梯度优化算法来训练BNN权重，使其能够执行生物系统中的回归和控制任务

Result: 数值实验表明，基于STL的学习方法能够高效解决研究的回归和控制任务，包括作为失调状态报告器和慢性疾病模型的反馈控制

Conclusion: STL规范为BNNs提供了有效的训练目标定义方法，成功实现了生物系统中的功能调控和疾病管理应用

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

*Maksim Kazanskii,Artem Kasianov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过分析训练数据在嵌入空间的分布，提出了一种无需重新训练的模型预测信心度估计方法，通过过滤低信心度预测来提高分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究训练数据分布对图像分类模型性能的影响，并尝试在不需重新训练的情况下估计模型对未见数据的预测信心度。

Method: 分析训练集在嵌入空间的表示，根据预测点与训练分布的距离过滤低信心度预测。使用多个嵌入模型来更健壮地估计信心度，因为不同嵌入捕获数据的互补特征。

Result: 在多个分类模型上都展示了一致的性能提升，通过排除分布外样本实现了进一步的准确性提高。

Conclusion: 该方法具有模型无关性和通用性，不仅适用于计算机视觉，还有潜力应用于自然语言处理等需要预测可靠性的领域。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the
performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the
training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model
predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach
filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the
training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving
classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several
classification models, showing consistent performance gains across
architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to
represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as
different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these
embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution
samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer
vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction
reliability is critical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MambaLite-Micro是首个在资源受限微控制器上部署Mamba模型的C语言推理引擎，通过权重轻量化、算子融合和内存优化，减少83%峰值内存，保持高精度和跨平台一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于微控制器内存有限、缺乏原生算子支持和嵌入式友好工具链，Mamba模型在MCU上的部署面临挑战，需要开发轻量级推理解决方案。

Method: 提出MambaLite-Micro管道：1) 将PyTorch模型权重导出为轻量格式；2) 用C语言手工实现Mamba层和支持算子，进行算子融合和内存布局优化，消除大型中间张量。

Result: 减少83.0%峰值内存，平均数值误差仅1.7x10⁻⁵，在关键词检测和人体活动识别任务中与PyTorch基线100%一致，在ESP32S3和STM32H7上验证了跨平台可移植性。

Conclusion: MambaLite-Micro成功将先进序列模型Mamba部署到资源受限嵌入式平台，为实际应用铺平道路，展示了在保持精度的同时显著降低内存使用的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to
limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of
embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first
deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU,
a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline
maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting
model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted
Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory
layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors,
reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of
only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on
keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks,
MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully
preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by
deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating
consistent operation across heterogeneous embedded platforms and paving the way
for bringing advanced sequence models like Mamba to real-world
resource-constrained applications.

### [306] [Self-Aligned Reward: Towards Effective and Efficient Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05489)
*Peixuan Han,Adit Krishnan,Gerald Friedland,Jiaxuan You,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了自对齐奖励(SAR)方法，通过相对困难度差值来补充二元正确性奖励，促进大语言模型的推理准确性和效率，实现了准确性提升4%以及推理成本降低30%的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可验证奖励信号仅提供二元正确性反馈，导致推理过度繁琐、计算成本高，而现有解决方案常以牺性准确性为代价。需要一种更细粒度的奖励信号来同时提高推理准确性和效率。

Method: 提出自对齐奖励(SAR)，定义为在查询条件下答案的相对困难度与独立答案相比的差值。这种方法优先选择简洁且与查询相关的回复，可靠地区分答案质量：简洁正确答案得分高于冗余答案，部分正确答案得分高于完全错误答案。

Result: 在4个模型和7个测试集上的评估显示，将SAR与PPO和GRPO等RL算法结合后，准确性提高4%，同时推理成本降低30%。SAR实现了准确性与效率之间的底特最优平衡，能够缩短回复但保留关键推理行为，压制不必要的详细说明。

Conclusion: 自对齐奖励(SAR)作为一种细粒度的奖励补充信号，有效补充了可验证奖励的不足，为更高效和更有效的大语言模型训练抓了路。该方法在保持关键推理能力的同时显著提升了效率，展示了在推理准确性与效率之间实现双赢的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse,
offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in
inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,
while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we
introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements
verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is
defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on
the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are
concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably
distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than
redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely
incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that
integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves
accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis
demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness
and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.
We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning
behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration
without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of
self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving
the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.

TL;DR: 提出RLA框架解决长视野目标条件任务，通过低层策略和高层预期模型协同工作，具有理论保证和收敛性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分层强化学习在自动发现层次结构和多级策略联合训练时的不稳定性问题，缺乏理论保证

Method: 学习两个协同模型：低层目标条件策略（到达子目标）和高层预期模型（作为规划器提出中间子目标），采用价值几何一致性原则训练预期模型

Result: RLA在各种条件下能够逼近全局最优策略

Conclusion: RLA为长视野目标条件任务中的分层规划和执行提供了一个有原则且收敛的方法

Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the
automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level
policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In
this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a
principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these
limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,
goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a
high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing
intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of
RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle
of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We
present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various
conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical
planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

*Sadegh Jafari,Aishwarya Sarkar,Mohiuddin Bilwal,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，通过分析静态指标和动态性能数据来自动化模型压缩（结构剪枝和动态量化），在保持精度的同时显著减少内存使用和提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型面临计算和内存瓶颈，传统压缩技术使用统一启发式方法而忽略了架构和运行时异质性，需要更智能的自动化压缩方案。

Method: 使用大型语言模型构建多智能体系统，结合静态指标（MACs、参数量）和动态信号（延迟、内存）来设计特定架构的压缩策略，进行结构化剪枝和训练后动态量化。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证：剪枝保持竞争力或提升精度（ImageNet-1K约1%下降，小数据集上ViT-B/16提升2%）；量化实现高达74%内存节省和<0.5%精度损失，推理速度提升1.74倍。

Conclusion: 智能体系统可作为可扩展的配置文件引导模型优化解决方案，LLM推理质量对迭代剪枝至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

TL;DR: OptiProxy-NAS是一个端到端的神经架构搜索优化框架，通过代理表示将离散、庞大的搜索空间转化为连续、可微且平滑的空间，从而可以使用梯度优化方法进行高效搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经架构搜索(NAS)是一个计算成本高昂的优化问题，搜索空间离散、庞大且具有尖峰特性。现有方法如基于预测器的方法和可微分架构搜索存在局限性，需要一种更高效的优化代理方法。

Method: 提出OptiProxy-NAS框架，使用代理表示将NAS搜索空间重新表述为连续、可微且平滑的空间，从而可以应用任何可微分优化方法进行梯度搜索。

Result: 在12个NAS任务、4个搜索空间和三个不同领域（计算机视觉、自然语言处理、资源受限NAS）的全面实验中，证明了该方法具有优越的搜索结果和效率。在低保真度场景下的进一步实验验证了其灵活性。

Conclusion: OptiProxy-NAS通过优化代理方法成功解决了NAS的离散优化难题，提供了一个高效、灵活的端到端优化框架，在多个领域和任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural
language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the
superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity
scenarios verify the flexibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于主动学习的无监督时间序列异常检测方法，通过DQS查询策略选择多样化样本来优化阈值选择，在小样本预算下表现最佳，所有策略都优于纯无监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督时间序列异常检测方法存在阈值设置不佳的问题，而声称无监督的方法实际上需要标注数据进行校准，这在现实世界中往往不可得。

Method: 将主动学习集成到现有无监督异常检测方法中，通过新颖的DQS（基于差异的查询策略）选择性查询多变量时间序列标签，使用动态时间规整评估异常分数相似性来最大化查询样本的多样性。

Result: DQS在小预算场景下表现最佳，但其他策略在面对错误标注时更鲁棒。所有查询策略即使在存在错误标注的情况下也优于无监督阈值。

Conclusion: 在实际应用中，查询策略的选择取决于标注专家的专业水平和愿意标注的样本数量。只要有可能查询专家，推荐使用基于主动学习的阈值方法。

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

Conclusion: 这种分布式训练方法显著提高了深度神经网络的训练效率，通过并行化和解耦技术有效解决了训练时间长和锁定问题。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Result: 计算实验证明了所提出的训练方法在解决MPCL网络分类任务方面的有效性

Conclusion: CCP方法为训练不可微分的形态感知机网络提供了一种有效的替代方案，能够成功处理多类分类任务

Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in
which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For
multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive
layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the
standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological
operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training
such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on
gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the
convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem
is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively
using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems.
Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.

Conclusion: SimPEL在复杂现实环境中具有数据高效学习和控制的潜力，能够弥合基于模型的强化学习中的模拟到现实差距。

Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for
data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: 建议在收集大规模数据集时添加探索数据，而不仅仅依赖专家数据，以提高模型在实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and
intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns
rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two
obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat
the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC)
classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest
(PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that
integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that
learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges
simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior
accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods,
affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.

Abstract: Energy forecasting is vital for grid reliability and operational efficiency.
Although recent advances in time series forecasting have led to progress,

Motivation: 分布外(OOD)检测对于提高AI系统的稳健性至关重要，但现有的评估方法存在限制。需要一种更可靠的评估框架来测试OOD检测方法在多样化条件下的性能表现和潜在的失败模式。

Method: 提出双重交叉验证框架(DCV-ROOD)，分别处理分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)数据：ID数据采用传统方式分割，OOD数据按类别分组。考虑类别层次结构，以获得公平的ID-OOD分区。

Result: 通过对比带有和不带离群暴露的独到OOD检测方法进行验证，结果显示该框架能够快速收敛到真实性能估计。

Conclusion: DCV-ROOD框架为OOD检测方法提供了一种可靠的评估方法，通过适应性地整合ID和OOD数据特性，并考虑类别层次结构，实现了更加稳健和公平的性能评估。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

Conclusion: ExoST框架成功解决了外生变量建模中的关键挑战，为时空预测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic
systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing
solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target
variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into
the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to
promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two
challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the
target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and
future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a
novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in
\underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,
then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated
expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent
space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized
sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which
recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into
dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs
are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic
balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency
of our proposed framework.

Motivation: 探索Transformer基础模型是否真正内部化了语义概念（如市场制度），以及是否能利用其内部表征来模拟稀罕但高风险的市场崩溃事件。

Method: 提出激活移植技术，通过将某事件（如历史崩溃）的统计矩征强制注入到另一事件（如平静期）的隐藏状态中，实现对预测结果的因果干预控制。

Result: 注入崩溃语义会导致下跌预测，而注入平静语义则能压制崩溃并恢复稳定性。模型编码了事件严重程度的等级概念，潜在向量模长与系统性震荡幅度直接相关。在Toto和Chronos两种不同架构的TSFM上验证有效。

Conclusion: 大型时间序列Transformer具有可控制、语义基础的表征能力，存在组织模型预测的潜在概念空间。这为从后验归因转向直接因果干预接释提供了证据，能够进行语义"假如"分析以支持战略性压力测试。

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

Conclusion: 在更一般的凸性假设下成功扩展了AMOO框架，为深度学习实践提供了更适用的多目标优化理论工具。

Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a
diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This
observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the
objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To
address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization
(AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable
convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong
assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a
unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study
gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or
Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in
deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and
metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such
tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their
convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that
demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our
methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，虽然共形预测能够以高概率覆盖真实类别，但其预测集大小与人类标注者标注的歧义性之间的相关性很弱，表明共形预测在捕捉数据固有歧义性（偶然不确定性）方面的能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测被期望通过预测集大小来捕捉偶然不确定性，但缺乏实证证据支持这一属性。本文旨在验证共形预测器是否能有效量化由类别重叠引起的数据集固有歧义性。

Method: 使用三种共形预测方法为八个深度学习模型生成预测集，这些模型在四个包含多人标注（5-50人）的数据集上训练。通过测量预测集大小与人类标注者分配的不同标签数量之间的相关性，以及预测集与人类标注的相似性来评估效果。

Result: 绝大多数共形预测输出与人类标注之间呈现非常弱到弱的相关性，只有少数显示中等相关性。这表明共形预测在捕捉偶然不确定性方面的能力有限。

Conclusion: 虽然共形预测能提供更高的真实类别覆盖率，但其捕捉偶然不确定性的能力有限，需要重新评估共形预测器生成的预测集的有效性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过在大规模社会科学实验数据集SocSci210上微调LLMs，显著提高了对人类行为模拟的准确性，在未见实验中的预测比基础模型提升26%，比GPT-4o提升13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLMs模拟社会科学实验结果，但需要提高模拟准确性以更好地支持实验假设筛选。

Method: 构建包含290万条响应数据的SocSci210数据集，对Qwen2.5-14B等模型进行微调，开发Socrates-Qwen-14B模型。

Result: 在完全未见研究中预测准确率提升26%，在新条件下泛化能力提升71%，人口统计偏差减少10.6%。

Conclusion: 微调社会科学实验数据可以显著提升LLMs在社会科学模拟中的准确性，为实验假设筛选提供更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the
results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that
finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments
meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social
science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset
comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source
social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of
generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model,
Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with
distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying
conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by
13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new
unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210
contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity, a measure
of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely
generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning
on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis
screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at

Abstract: The rise of distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning has sparked
interest in decentralized gradient marketplaces, where participants trade
intermediate artifacts like gradients. However, existing Federated Learning
(FL) benchmarks overlook critical economic and systemic factors unique to such
marketplaces-cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market
stability-especially when a buyer relies on a private baseline dataset for
evaluation.
  We introduce a comprehensive benchmark framework to holistically evaluate
robust gradient aggregation methods within these buyer-baseline-reliant
marketplaces. Our contributions include: (1) a simulation environment modeling
marketplace dynamics with a variable buyer baseline and diverse seller
distributions; (2) an evaluation methodology augmenting standard FL metrics
with marketplace-centric dimensions such as Economic Efficiency, Fairness, and
Selection Dynamics; (3) an in-depth empirical analysis of the existing
Distributed Gradient Marketplace framework, MartFL, including the integration
and comparative evaluation of adapted FLTrust and SkyMask as alternative
aggregation strategies within it. This benchmark spans diverse datasets, local
attacks, and Sybil attacks targeting the marketplace selection process; and (4)
actionable insights into the trade-offs between model performance, robustness,
cost, fairness, and stability.
  This benchmark equips the community with essential tools and empirical
evidence to evaluate and design more robust, equitable, and economically viable
decentralized gradient marketplaces.

Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service
systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain
expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and
accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling
and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream
data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,
or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event
types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence
distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can
effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction
of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework
on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its
utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual
evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing
availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,
data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network
models across service domains.

*Rishabh Dixit,Yuan Hui,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了机器学习中的遗忘验证问题，分析了对抗性伪造数据的可能性，证明了在大多数情况下随机采样到伪造数据的概率极小，为检测虚假遗忘声明提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受隐私法规和消除有害数据影响的需求驱动，机器学习遗忘旨在修改训练模型使其有效"忘记"指定数据。验证遗忘的关键挑战是对抗性伪造数据——制作能模仿目标点梯度的数据，从而在不实际移除信息的情况下制造遗忘的假象。

Method: 提出了一个分析框架，考虑梯度近似目标梯度在容差ε内的数据点集合（称为ε-伪造集）。对于线性回归和单层神经网络，分析了该集合的Lebesgue测度；在一般正则性假设下，证明了伪造集测度随ε^{(d-r)/2}衰减，其中d是数据维度，r是模型梯度定义的变分矩阵的零度。

Result: 研究表明伪造集的测度很小，按ε的阶数缩放，当ε足够小时为ε^d。更一般地，在温和正则性假设下，伪造集测度以ε^{(d-r)/2}的速度衰减。扩展分析到批量SGD和几乎处处光滑损失函数得到相同的渐近缩放。概率界限表明，在非退化数据分布下，随机采样到伪造点的可能性极小。

Conclusion: 对抗性伪造在根本上受到限制，虚假的遗忘声明原则上可以被检测到，这为机器学习遗忘系统的安全性提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of
harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they
effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning
is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target
point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing
information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data
points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance
$\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a
framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural
networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on
the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$.
More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging
set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and
$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.
Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the
same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing
that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly
sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence
that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning
claims can, in principle, be detected.

Result: 自监睦物理信息神经网络成功预测钠的传热率，误差约为±8%，其他机器学习方法也在8%以内

Conclusion: 机器学习模型为液体金属冷却微型燥池的设计和优化提供了高效的代替工具

Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer
coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks.
Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network
are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in
rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised
physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to
increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed
neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the
loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a
better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on
water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the
self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat
transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only
physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine
learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity
modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for
the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.

Motivation: 现有LLM-based Text-to-SQL方法忽视了数据库模式信息的重要性，而研究发现模式信息对生成高质量SQL查询起着重要甚至主导作用。

Method: 提出包含两个组件的数据库模式专家：1）X-Linking：基于LLM监督微调的Schema Linking方法；2）X-Admin：通过桥接抽象模式信息和用户自然语言问题来实现Schema Understanding。还采用多LLM策略提升系统性能。

Result: 在Spider-Dev数据集上达到84.9%的执行准确率，在Spider-Test数据集上达到82.5%的执行准确率，成为基于开源模型的最佳Text-to-SQL框架。

Conclusion: X-SQL通过有效利用数据库模式信息，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了模式信息在此任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation
tasks, Text-to-SQL has become one of the most popular downstream applications.
Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks,
the research community often overlooks the importance of database schema
information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema
information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two
components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning
(SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to
existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose
an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap
between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question.
Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with
Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its
performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework,
X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset
and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes
X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

Conclusion: SOOTT框架和相应算法能够有效平衡轨迹跟踪、决策平滑性和对外部干扰的韧性，为在线决策问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT)
problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online
decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a
dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding
unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as
elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must
balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden
demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust
algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical
performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates
untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision
process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST
when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary
prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload
scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.

Result: 该架构不仅更准确，而且代表了创建更适应性和智能预测系统的根本性进步

Conclusion: UIFM模型为真正的行为理解提供了基础模型，是构建能够理解和预测复杂演化事件序列系统的重要进展

Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

Conclusion: PolicyEvolve为多玩家游戏提供了一种高效、可解释的程序化策略生成框架，解决了传统MARL方法的资源消耗和可解释性问题

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

Conclusion: ARIES是首个建立时间序列数据属性与建模策略关系的研究，同时实现了模型推荐系统，为现实世界时间序列提供可解释的建议

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

Conclusion: 提出的FCRN代理模型在精度和效率方面均表现优异，为大型高温超导磁体的快速分析提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet
size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when
multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of
large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a
fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the
space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets
were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.
The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture
achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),
with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer
providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and
generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can
reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,
with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several
orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when
training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed
FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a
promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over
larger-later rewards, are a key feature of human and animal decision-making.
Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this
behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework
has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for
precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation
and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our
results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.

*Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨生成式AI的理论基础，将生成视为与预测、压缩和决策相关的独立机器学习任务，系统综述了五大生成模型家族，并提出了概率和博弈论框架来理解生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI从文本图像扩展到音频、视频、代码和分子等领域，需要深入理解生成作为机器学习任务的理论基础，而不仅仅是关注具体模型实现。

Method: 采用任务优先的框架，系统综述五大生成模型家族（自回归模型、变分自编码器、标准化流、生成对抗网络、扩散模型），提出概率框架区分密度估计和生成，并引入博弈论的双玩家对抗学习设置。

Result: 建立了生成式AI的理论分析框架，明确了生成任务与预测、压缩、决策的关系，为不同生成模型提供了统一的理论视角，并讨论了后训练修改和社会责任等重要议题。

Conclusion: 生成式AI需要从任务本质角度理解，而不仅仅是技术实现。论文提供了系统的理论框架，强调了社会责任在AI生成内容中的重要性，包括隐私保护、AI内容检测和版权问题。

Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video,
computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the
question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine
learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making.
We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models,
variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks,
and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that
emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review
a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study
generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative
models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially
responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and
copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what
generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models
implement it.

*Dibyajyoti Nayak,Somdatta Goswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合图神经网络和显式时间步进方法的框架(GNS)，用于解决神经算子在数据稀缺情况下学习偏微分方程的问题，显著提高了数据效率和长期预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子需要大量训练数据且在数据稀缺时表现不佳，许多现有方法没有显式编码物理演化的因果性和时间局部性结构，而自回归模型虽然保持因果性但存在误差快速累积的问题。

Method: 采用图神经网络模拟器(GNS)框架，结合消息传递图神经网络和显式数值时间步进方案，通过建模瞬时时间导数来学习PDE解。引入了PCA+KMeans轨迹选择策略来提升低数据性能。

Result: 在三个经典PDE系统上的实验表明，GNS仅使用3%的训练数据(30个样本)就能实现低于1%的相对L2误差，相比FNO和DeepONet等基线方法，将自回归误差分别降低了82.48%和99.86%。

Conclusion: 将基于图的局部归纳偏置与传统时间积分器相结合，能够产生准确、物理一致且可扩展的时变PDE替代模型，显著提高了数据效率和长期预测稳定性。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training
data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time
structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality
by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We
employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network
framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate
forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time
derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D
Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D
Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly
improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with
substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines
like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors
with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all
three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended
temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error
by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a
PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance.
Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional
time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate
models for time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven
largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology,
particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of
ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home
environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user
locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are
significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real
environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose
a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while
performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as
well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact
of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination
of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm,
highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location
estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity
recognition in residential settings.

TL;DR: 通过提出一种基于可参数化乘积共享模板的新方法，在保持精度的前提下进一步减小神经网络中算术运算器的面积和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设处上部署神经网络时，需要在能耗与精度之间取得平衡。近似计算技术可通过稍微降低算术运算器的精度来减少能耗，但现有方法在面积节省方面还有改进空间。

Method: 改进现有的XPAT布尔重写技术，提出一种基于可参数化乘积共享的新模板结构。该模板能够更好地作为合成面积的代理指标，通过模板参数来控制电路的近似程度。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法能够比原始XPAT和其他两种状态的艺术方法更好地进行近似计算，在相同精度损失下获得更大的面积节省，并能更好地收敛到低面积解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过提出基于可参数化乘积共享模板的新方法，该研究在神经网络算术运算器的近似计算方面取得了较现有方法更优称的性能，为边缘设处上的能耗优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between
the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting
classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate
computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the
accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to
reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks -
i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we
improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To
achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently
proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite
circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to
produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum
of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters
can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on
parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.
We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area
solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original
XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 城市分析中的异质多模态数据带来挑战，尽管可视化工具能支持融合数据的探索，但缺乏对融合数据与独立数据源效果对比的系统性研究

Method: 开发了一个可视化辅助框架，用于分析融合潜在数据表征与分离表征在发现动态和静态城市数据模式方面的效果对比

Result: 分析显示组合的潜在表征能够产生更结构化的模式，而分离的表征在特定情况下也有其用途

Conclusion: 融合异质多模态数据的潜在表征在城市分析中具有更好的模式发现能力，但不同的表征方式在不同场景下各有优势

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to
simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While
these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its
granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges,
visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

Motivation: 现有Lung-RADS系统仅基于肺结节特征进行风险分层，缺乏对多种风险因素的综合考虑，在敏感性和特异性之间存在权衡问题

Method: 构建推理语言模型(RLM)，通过数据集构建与蒸馏、监督微调、强化学习和综合评估的系统研究，将风险评估任务分解为子组件并整合成最终风险评分

Result: 在国家肺癌筛查试验数据集上风险预测性能显著提升，能够分析多种风险因素的贡献，通过思维链推理过程提高预测准确性和可监控性

Conclusion: 该方法通过推理语言模型整合多源医疗信息，为肺癌筛查提供更准确、可解释的个性化风险评估，有助于临床转化应用

Abstract: Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling
early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung
CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

Abstract: Graph clustering under the framework of differential privacy, which aims to
process graph-structured data while protecting individual privacy, has been
receiving increasing attention. Despite significant achievements in current
research, challenges such as high noise, low efficiency and poor
interpretability continue to severely constrain the development of this field.
In this paper, we construct a differentially private and interpretable graph
clustering approach based on metric embedding initialization. Specifically, we
construct an SDP optimization, extract the key set and provide a
well-initialized clustering configuration using an HST-based initialization
method. Subsequently, we apply an established k-median clustering strategy to
derive the cluster results and offer comparative explanations for the query set
through differences from the cluster centers. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods
in various clustering metrics while strictly ensuring privacy.

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research
in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G
environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at:

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining
response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost
trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a
quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically
selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified
tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular
architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts
annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality
prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with
tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over
quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders
with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to
hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level
dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a
comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality
annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR
achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the
strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms

Conclusion: 跨视图对齐是必要的，门控融合优于后期融合和纯LLM变体，语言模型在冷启动/长尾场景中占主导，图结构在其他场景稳定排序

Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming,
shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse
interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present
RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a
preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with
lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from
titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative
embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric
contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language
to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings
elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on
all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\%
(Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both
the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late
fusion and LLM-only variants.

TL;DR: 提出基于时空图卷积网络(ST-GCN)的方法，用于快速准确预测大规模时序电路中的长周期故障影响概率，显著减少仿真时间10倍以上，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静默数据错误(SDEs)会降低安全关键系统的可靠性，功能测试检测SDE相关故障但仿真成本高昂，需要高效的故障影响预测方法。

Method: 将门级网表建模为时空图以捕捉拓扑和信号时序，使用专用的空间和时间编码器来高效预测多周期故障影响概率。

Result: 在ISCAS-89基准测试中，方法减少仿真时间10倍以上，5周期预测的平均绝对误差为0.024，支持测试点选择优化。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到SoC级测试策略优化，适用于下游电子设计自动化流程，在效率和准确性之间提供良好权衡。

Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade
safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is
expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact
probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk
assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to
capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders
predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method
reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean
absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features
from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points
by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The
approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream
electronic design automation flows.

TL;DR: LoaQ是一种针对层级后训练量化的输出近似方法，通过显式目标输出一致性来更好地实现量化直觉，具有闭式解且与现有技术正交，在LLaMA和Qwen模型上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层级PTQ方法采用局部视图，只能实现权重的激活感知近似，导致近似不足且与原始输出存在偏差，需要更准确的输出级一致性方法

Method: 基于对主流LLMs结构特征的深入理解，提出LoaQ方法，显式目标输出级一致性，具有简单闭式解，可与现有量化管道集成

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型家族上实验表明，LoaQ在仅权重量化和权重-激活联合量化中都表现有效，能进一步提升整体量化质量

Conclusion: LoaQ与现有量化策略无缝集成，显示出推动后训练量化前沿的强大潜力

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each
component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training
quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and
can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a
result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations
from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate
approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,
but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full
model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics
of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for
layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better
aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,
making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into
existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model
families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and
weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing
quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and
shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WindFM是一个轻量级生成式基础模型，专门用于概率性风电功率预测，通过离散化-生成框架和Transformer架构，在126,000多个站点的大规模数据上预训练，实现了零样本的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动方法无法泛化到其他位置或难以融入能源领域特定数据的问题，需要开发专门针对风电预测的基础模型。

Method: 采用离散化-生成框架：专用时间序列分词器将连续多变量观测转换为离散分层标记，然后使用仅解码器Transformer通过自回归预训练学习风电生成动态的通用表示。

Result: 仅8.1M参数的紧凑模型在确定性和概率性任务上实现了零样本最先进性能，超越了专用模型和更大的基础模型，在不同大陆的分布外数据下表现出强适应性。

Conclusion: WindFM展示了学习表示的鲁棒性和可迁移性，为风电预测提供了有效的轻量级基础模型解决方案，预训练模型已公开可用。

Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern
power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a
site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on
fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are
difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper
introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed
specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a
discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first
converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical
tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal
representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on
these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising
approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM
develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between
atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming
specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In
particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data
from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of
its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at
https://github.com/shiyu-coder/WindFM.

TL;DR: 提出了一个冗余指数ρ(C)来直接量化潜在表示中的维度间依赖性，通过分析耦合矩阵并与正态分布比较来评估表示质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络常产生冗余的潜在空间，多个坐标编码重叠信息，降低有效容量并阻碍泛化。标准指标如准确率或重构损失只能间接证明这种冗余

Method: 通过分析潜在表示的耦合矩阵，比较其非对角线统计量与正态分布的能量距离，构建紧凑、可解释且统计基础的表征质量度量

Result: 在MNIST变体、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证，低ρ(C)可靠预测高分类准确率或低重构误差，而高冗余与性能崩溃相关

Conclusion: ρ(C)揭示了冗余作为跨模型和任务的通用瓶颈，为评估和改进学习表示的效率提供了理论视角和实用工具

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在零样本时间序列预测中的涌现能力，特别是如何在没有专门训练的情况下处理偏微分方程解的时空外推问题

Method: 使用文本训练的基础模型处理离散化的偏微分方程解，分析多步预测中的误差积累，研究token级输出分布以理解ICL进程

Result: 预测精度随时间上下文增长而提高，但在更细空间离散化时下降；多步预测误差随时间范围代数增长；发现ICL三阶段进程：语法模式模仿→高熵探索→数值化预测

Conclusion: LLMs能够通过上下文学习有效处理PDE解的时空外推，表现出可预测的神经缩放规律，为理解模型内部处理机制提供了新见解

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning
(ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately
extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting.
Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at
finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model
recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors
grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error
accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends
as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably
with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are
able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we
analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL
progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through
an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically
grounded predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决基于患者生成健康数据（如自然语言餐驿记录）进行营养目标对齐分类的挑战，以支持精准医疗中的个性化营养指导。

Method: 使用涉及114名低收入群体的3000余份餐驿记录数据集，通过注册营养师专家评估构建金标准。采用TFIDF和BERT文本嵌入、领域知识增强（包括本体论、成分解析器、巨营养素内容）作为输入，评估逻辑回归和多层感矩分类器的性能。

Result: 即使没有数据增强，机器学习模型也超过了人类自我评估。最佳模型组合（机器学习分类器+数据增强）达到更高的准确率。成分解析、食物实体和巨营养素信息的增强在多个营养目标上都表现良好，但不同目标的分类准确性存在差异。

Conclusion: 机器学习能够利用非结构化自然语言餐驿记录，可靠地分类餐食是否符合特定营养目标，效果超过人类自我评估，特别是当融入营养领域知识时。这为精准医疗中的患者为中心营养指导提供了潜力。

Abstract: This study examined the use of machine learning and domain specific
enrichment on patient generated health data, in the form of free text meal
logs, to classify meals on alignment with different nutritional goals. We used
a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a
diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered
dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold
standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and
domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient
parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of
logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment.
Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who
logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with
enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with
enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information
performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in
the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of
classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize
unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with
specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when
incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential
of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered
nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大语言模型在数学计算能力上的鲁棒性，发现虽然LLM在确定性算法执行方面表现良好，但在需要启发式搜索的组合难题上表现不佳，表明其数值推理更像是模式匹配而非真正的分析思维。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然展现出卓越的涌现能力，但其数值推理的鲁棒性仍是一个开放问题。标准基准测试使用聚合指标评估复杂问题集，但往往掩盖了基础性弱点。

Method: 通过评估从基本运算到组合难题的逐步复杂问题来探测LLM的数学计算能力。测试了多个最先进的基于LLM的智能体在100个问题挑战上，包括四个类别：基础算术、高级运算、素数检查和24点数字游戏。

Result: 智能体在前三个需要确定性算法执行的类别上取得了高准确率，但在需要在大组合空间进行启发式搜索的数字游戏上持续失败。

Conclusion: LLM的熟练度主要局限于回忆和执行已知算法，而非执行生成性问题解决。这表明它们表面的数值推理更像是复杂的模式匹配，而非灵活的分析思维，限制了其在需要新颖或创造性数值洞察的任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical
insights.

Method: 提出Ban&Pick策略：Pick发现并强化关键专家群体，Ban根据层和token敏感性动态剪枝冗余专家

Result: 在DeepSeek和Qwen3等MoE-LLM上，数学、代码和推理基准测试显示准确率显著提升（如Qwen3-30B-A3B在AIME2024从80.67提升到84.66），推理速度提升1.25倍

Conclusion: Ban&Pick为细粒度MoE模型提供了免费的性能增益和推理加速，无需重新训练或架构更改，有效解决了专家利用不足和冗余问题

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling
large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the
vLLM.

Motivation: 在大数据时代，从高维数据中选择关键变量至关重要，稀疏回归是实现模型简洁性和可解释性的强大工具。

Method: 重新使用基于统计物理的变分断头算法(VG)，引入显式特征选择旋转变量，利用变分推理求解可处理损失函数，并结合自动微分技术进行可扩展和高效优化。

Result: VG在高度稀疏情况下表现特别好，比Ridge和LASSO回归更一致和稳健。发现了一个尖锐转变点：当免余变量被引入时，泛化性能力突然下降且选择变量的不确定性增加。

Conclusion: 这个转变点提供了估计相关变量数量的实用信号，可应用于压缩感知和机器学习模型剪枝等广泛领域的稀疏建模。

Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important
in the era of big data. Sparse regression serves as a powerful tool for this
purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we
revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based
Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin
variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss
function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation
techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on
both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our
results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes,
offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO
regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp
transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades
abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This
transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number
of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key
predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for
sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed
sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

Conclusion: MGKD框架成功实现了服务中行为知识向服务前风险评估的迁移，显著提升了金融服务风险管理的预测性能

Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service
risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately.
This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation
(abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through
the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法通过惩罚项处理QoS约束缺乏理论收敛保证，在实际场景中经常无法满足服务质量要求，需要一种理论上有保证的解决方案。

Method: 首先扩展WMMSE算法到多通道QoS约束场景(eWMMSE)，然后开发基于GNN的JCPGNN-M算法支持多通道分配，最后提出将GNN与拉格朗日原始-对偶优化方法结合的理论框架。

Result: JCPGNN-M在性能上匹配eWMMSE，同时在推理速度、对大网络的泛化能力以及不完美信道状态信息下的鲁棒性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来无线网络中的约束资源分配提供了一个可扩展且理论上有保障的解决方案。

Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless
communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional
deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating
penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.
However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees
and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.
Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a
multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE
(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution
when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and
improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of
supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the
limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled
framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization
method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure
satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of
eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to
larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This
work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained
resource allocation in future wireless networks.

Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep
learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment
on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse
engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but
they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing
quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse
support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately
and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery

Motivation: 解决时间序列异常检测中标注异常稀缺的问题，现有异常假设方法存在补丁式生成和异常偏移两个根本性限制。

Method: 设计CutAddPaste机制进行目标化异常注入，引入标签修正策略自适应优化异常标签，在时序卷积网络中使用双空间混合增强决策边界。

Conclusion: CAPMix通过可控异常增强有效解决了异常检测中的补丁式生成和异常偏移问题，为时间序列异常检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes

TL;DR: DyC-STG是一个用于IoT数据可信度分析的动态因果时空图网络，通过事件驱动的动态图模块和因果推理模块，在真实数据集上实现了93.0%的F1分数，优于现有最佳方法1.4个百分点。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决IoT时空数据流中数据可信度分析的挑战，特别是传统STG模型在动态人机环境中的两个根本局限：静态图拓扑无法捕捉物理事件驱动的动态性，以及容易混淆伪相关与真实因果关系。

Method: 提出DyC-STG框架，包含两个协同模块：事件驱动的动态图模块（实时调整图拓扑以反映物理状态变化）和因果推理模块（通过严格强制执行时间优先性来提取因果感知表示）。

Result: 在发布的两个新真实世界数据集上进行全面实验，DyC-STG建立了新的最先进水平，比最强基线高出1.4个百分点，F1分数最高达到0.930。

Conclusion: DyC-STG通过动态图拓扑和因果推理的有效结合，显著提升了IoT数据可信度分析的性能，为解决动态人机环境中的数据可信度问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of
up to 0.930.

Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and
chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of
liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures
solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing
challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws
as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model,
HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary
mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent
predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the
inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process.
Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust
extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional
parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The
trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive
interface is provided on our website, MLPROP.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Wasserstein GAN（WGAN）在非线性激活函数和非高斯数据情况下的最优参数选择问题，推导出了一维WGAN的闭式最优参数解，并通过切片Wasserstein框架扩展到高维情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WGAN参数选择方法主要局限于线性二次高斯（LQG）设置，即神经网络为线性且数据为高斯分布。本文旨在超越LQG设置，研究在非线性激活函数和非高斯数据情况下WGAN的最优参数特性。

Method: 1）推导一维WGAN在非线性激活函数和非高斯数据下的闭式最优参数；2）采用切片Wasserstein框架扩展到高维WGAN，将随机投影数据的边际分布约束替换为原始数据联合分布约束；3）证明线性生成器在切片WGAN中对于非高斯数据具有渐近最优性。

Result: 1）闭式WGAN参数在高斯和拉普拉斯分布数据下均表现出良好的收敛行为；2）与r-PCA方法相比，所提出的切片WGAN解决方案在达到相同性能的同时需要更少的计算资源。

Conclusion: 本文成功突破了LQG设置的限制，为WGAN在更广泛的实际应用场景中提供了理论支持和有效的参数选择方法，特别是在处理非线性激活函数和非高斯数据时表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown
distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been
widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer
vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and
only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of
the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on
optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we
focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG
setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs
when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.
To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein
framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly
projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original
(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically
optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our
closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component
analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve
the same performance while requiring less computational resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QualityFM是一个用于PPG和ECG生理信号质量评估的多模态基础模型，通过大规模预训练和双轨架构设计，解决了信号质量差导致的误报警问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU和手术室中记录的PPG和ECG信号经常存在质量差、不完整和不一致的问题，导致误报警和诊断不准确。现有方法泛化性有限、依赖大量标注数据且跨任务迁移能力差。

Method: 采用双轨架构处理不同质量的配对生理信号，使用自蒸馏策略让高质量信号编码器指导低质量信号编码器训练。集成窗口稀疏注意力机制处理长序列信号，结合蒸馏损失和重建损失的复合损失函数保持频域特征。

Result: 在包含2100万30秒波形和17.9万小时数据的大规模数据集上预训练了三个不同参数规模（960万到3.19亿）的模型，在心室颤动误报警检测、房颤识别和动脉血压估计三个临床任务上展示了良好效果。

Conclusion: QualityFM通过大规模预训练和创新的架构设计，为生理信号质量评估提供了一个通用性强、可迁移的基础模型，有效解决了临床信号质量问题的挑战。

Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

Motivation: 目前大多数车道更换意图预测算法仅在单一数据集上训练和测试，缺乏对模型在不同群体数据上演化性能的验证。研究者想要测试变换器模型在不同地区数据集上的跨数据集性能。

Method: 使用LevelX在德国和香港收集的两个数据集，对变换器模型进行车道更换意图预测测试，测试单一数据集训练和多数据集同时训练的性能差异。

Result: 在异构数据集上，变换器的准确率从86.71%大幅下降至39.43%；但当同时在两个数据集上训练时，模型可以达到86.71%的高准确率。

Conclusion: 车道更换意图预测模型存在显著的数据集偏置问题，单一数据集训练导致演化性能差。多数据源训练是提高模型通用性的有效方法。

Abstract: As a result of the growing importance of lane change intention prediction for
a safe and efficient driving experience in complex driving scenarios,
researchers have in recent years started to train novel machine learning
algorithms on available datasets with promising results. A shortcoming of this
recent research effort, though, is that the vast majority of the proposed
algorithms are trained on a single datasets. In doing so, researchers failed to
test if their algorithm would be as effective if tested on a different dataset
and, by extension, on a different population with respect to the one on which
they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane
change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and
Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a
population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low
as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could
achieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the

Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender
strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent
protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods
for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a
formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender
strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy.
Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to
mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the
CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and
compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the
CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the
learned defender strategy and the required training time.

Conclusion: 基于结果的探索为强化学习方法提供了一条实用路径，既能增强推理能力，又不牺牲对可扩展部署至关重要的多样性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在肺心电图分析中的可解释性限制，开发既能进行预测又能提供临床见解的模型。

Method: 使用OxMat肺心电图数据集训练监督VAE模型，结合Kullback-Leibler散度和总相关约束来结构潜在空间，评估方法包括AUROC、MSE和多种可解释性分析。

Result: 模型在段落级别和CTG级别分别获得0.752和0.779的AUROC。基线相关特征被良好表达且与模型分数一致，而变异性指标表达较弱。

Conclusion: 监督VAE能够在进行竞争力预测的同时部分编码临床意义特征，为未来可解释生成模型奠定基础，但FHR信号的复杂性对完全解结构造成了挑战。

Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder
(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy
outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning
approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on
five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.
The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,
incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)
constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared
error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,
latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model
achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,
where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both
reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related
features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned
with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were
less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline
features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised
decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates
that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while
partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,
multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling
physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as
ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports
clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future
interpretable, generative models.

Conclusion: CLAN通过创新的负样本生成策略，显著提升了网络入侵检测的准确性和效率，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and

domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We
highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research
priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and
infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and
organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical
innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary
education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for
reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable
collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for
technical progress.

### [377] [Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06599)
*Sri Satish Krishna Chaitanya Bulusu,Mikko Sillanpää*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个理论框架来分析动态非线性系统的静态和动态失真耦合问题，通过结构化分解和方差分析建立了行为不确定性原理，证明静态和动态失真不能同时最小化，并提供了与热力学第一定律相关的有限记忆条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态非线性系统中的静态和动态效应相互耦合，给数据驱动建模带来重大挑战，需要建立理论基础来理解这种耦合关系并指导建模实践。

Method: 采用结构化分解、方差分析和任务中心复杂度界限的理论框架，包括方向性下界、方差不等式、行为指标和记忆有限性指数，建立了行为不确定性原理和函数方差与学习复杂度的联系定理。

Result: 证明了静态和动态失真不能同时最小化，现实系统由于静态动态效应纠缠而抵抗完全确定性分解，提出了模型无关的任务感知复杂度度量，表明低方差分量更容易学习。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂动态非线性系统建模提供了可扩展的理论基础方法，解释了结构化残差学习在功率放大器线性化等实验中的经验优势，包括改进泛化、减少参数数量和降低训练成本。

Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and
dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for
data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in
structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity
bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between
measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces
to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities
for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a
memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a
measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law
of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical
bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty
Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be
minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist
complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic
effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance
to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a
model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance
components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual
learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower
training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization
experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable,
theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

### [378] [PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Graph Convolutional Networks on Inductive Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06600)
*Huayi Tang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了图卷积网络在动态图环境中的PAC-Bayesian理论分析，针对非独立同分布的节点数据推导了新的泛化边界，并建立了保证泛化间隙收敛的条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图具有动态特性，节点不断添加且连接关系随时间变化，而现有的基于传导学习框架的理论研究无法充分建模这种时间演化和结构动态。

Method: 采用PAC-Bayesian理论分析方法，将节点视为依赖且非独立同分布的数据点，对一层和两层图卷积网络进行理论推导，明确纳入数据依赖性和非平稳性的影响。

Result: 推导出了包含数据依赖性和非平稳性效应的新泛化边界，建立了保证泛化间隙随节点数量增加而收敛到零的充分条件，发现两层GCN需要更强的图拓扑假设才能保证收敛。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解和改进动态图环境中图神经网络泛化能力建立了理论基础，为处理动态图数据提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing
graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of
real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually
added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical
studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to
adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this
paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent
and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization
bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data
dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under
which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes
increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal
that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee
convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding
and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工编写分子质诊疗委员会(MTB)病人摘要工作量大、主观性强且容易遗漏关键信息，需要自动化方案提高效率和质量。

Method: 开发HAO多代理人系统生成病人摘要，设计TBFact"模型作为判官"框架评估摘要的全面性和简洁性，使用脱敏化资料进行验证。

Result: 代理系统捐捕了94%高重要信息，在严格含义标准下达到0.84的TBFact回归率，并支持无需共享敏感数据的本地部署。

Conclusion: HAO与TBFact为MTB提供了可靠、可扩展的自动化摘要生成和评估解决方案，有效解决了临床工作流的效率和质量挑战。

Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解推理训练如何改变语言模型的计算机制，目前这方面的机制仍然不够清晰。研究旨在通过可解释的小型加性干预来匹配完整微调性能。

Method: 使用强化学习目标训练插入基础模型残差流中的轻量级引导向量，采用logit-lens读取、路径修补和电路分析等方法分析两个模型。

Result: 发现最后一层引导向量表现为集中在第一个生成令牌上的令牌替换偏置，持续提升如"To"和"Step"等令牌；倒数第二层引导向量保持注意力模式基本不变，通过MLP和反嵌入优先加权过程词和结构符号。

Conclusion: 这些结果为解释推理训练引起的行为变化建立了一个原则性框架，展示了如何通过可解释的干预实现与完整微调相当的性能。

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model
computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors
inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a
reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance
while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using
logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models
and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution
bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens
such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves
attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and
unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.
These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral
changes induced by reasoning training.

Motivation: 现有GAD方法大多假设训练和测试分布相同且针对特定任务设计，在现实场景中面临数据分布偏移和新应用训练样本稀缺的挑战，缺乏对泛化能力的系统性理解。

Method: 通过追溯GAD泛化研究的发展历程，形式化问题设置，构建系统性分类体系，并对现有广义GAD方法进行全面回顾和分析。

Result: 建立了GAD泛化问题的系统化框架，提供了细粒度的分类体系，并对当前方法进行了全面总结。

Conclusion: 识别了当前开放挑战并提出了未来研究方向，旨在推动这一新兴领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent
years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based
applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods
assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to
specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such
as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.
To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the
generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that
leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or
developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple
applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is
still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD
and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic
taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive
review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we
identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire
future research in this emerging field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共情预测方法依赖主观报告和观察标签，存在偏差且无法客观捕捉共情形成过程。现有EEG方法主要提取静态模式，忽略了时间动态特征。

Method: BEAM框架包含三个核心组件：1)LaBraM编码器进行时空特征提取；2)特征融合模块整合多视角信号；3)对比学习模块增强类别分离。

Result: 在CBCP数据集上，BEAM在多个指标上优于最先进方法，证明了其客观评估共情水平的潜力。

Conclusion: BEAM为儿童共情评估提供了客观方法，并为早期干预儿童亲社会发展提供了初步见解。

Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a
feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view
signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.
Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment
and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's
prosocial development.

Motivation: 解决传统路由策略在涉及全局图结构时的复杂性问题，通过局部信息学习可沿用的高效路由策略

Method: 利用网络领域知识选择输入特征和设计策略函数，训练深度神经网络学习局部路由策略，仅需单个图的少量数据样本

Result: 学习到了与Greedy Forwarding完全匹配的策略，以及新的GreedyTensile路由策略，该策略综合了目标距离和节点伸缩特征，性能几乎总是超过贪心转发

Conclusion: 方法能够通过局部信息学习到高效可沿用的路由策略，GreedyTensile路由具有超低延迟和可解释性，通过简单线性操作实现

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a
single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich
class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the
all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs)
that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets
by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of
input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately
optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the
choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for
generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using
distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that
exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets
to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a
new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both
distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost
always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and
ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically
interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.

Motivation: 个体出行行为响应对城市交通监管和政策评估至关重要，但传统MDP方法数据需求量大且面临时空覆盖和情境多样性挑战。

Method: 基于群体效应增强的生成对抗模仿学习(gcGAIL)模型，利用乘客群体间的共享行为模式来提升建模效率。

Result: gcGAIL在公共交通票价折扣案例中表现优于AIRL、基线GAIL和条件GAIL等方法，对空间变化、数据稀疏性和行为多样性具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: gcGAIL能够预测任何时间的个体行为响应，为个性化激励措施提供基础，促进可持续行为改变。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial
for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision
process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior
modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is
highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal
coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a
group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model
that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared
behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using
a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against
state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results
demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel
behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust
to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining
strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented
passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at
any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable
behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).

TL;DR: TrajAware是一个基于强化学习的VANET路由框架，通过动作空间剪枝、图交叉注意力和轨迹感知预测来解决动态拓扑和边缘设备资源限制问题，在多种网络条件下实现了接近最短路径和高投递率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANETs在智能交通系统中至关重要，但由于动态拓扑、不完全观测和边缘设备资源有限，路由仍然具有挑战性。现有的RL方法通常假设固定图结构，在网络条件变化时需要重新训练，不适合在受限硬件上部署。

Method: TrajAware包含三个组件：(i)动作空间剪枝，减少冗余邻居选项同时保持两跳可达性；(ii)图交叉注意力，将剪枝后的邻居映射到全局图上下文；(iii)轨迹感知预测，使用历史路由和路口信息估计部分观测下的实时位置。

Result: 在SUMO模拟器中使用真实城市地图进行评估，TrajAware实现了接近最短路径和高投递率，同时在完全和部分观测场景中都优于最先进的基线方法，保持了适合受限边缘设备的效率。

Conclusion: TrajAware框架为VANETs中的边缘AI部署提供了一个有效的解决方案，能够在动态网络条件下实现高性能路由，同时满足边缘设备的资源约束要求。

Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的小型浅层神经网络Barycentric Neural Network（BNN），利用重心坐标和固定基点集来精确表示连续分段线性函数，并引入了长度加权持久熵（LWPE）作为稳定的拓扑特征，通过优化基点而非内部权重来实现更优的函数逼近性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度神经网络是通用逼近器，但深度或过参数化架构计算成本高。需要一种在资源受限环境下（如有限基点和训练周期）能够提供灵活且可解释的函数逼近方法。

Method: 提出BNN网络结构，利用固定基点和重心坐标定义网络；引入LWPE作为损失函数；直接优化定义BNN的基点而不是内部权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比MSE、RMSE、MAE和log-cosh等经典损失函数，实现了更优越和更快的逼近性能。

Conclusion: BNN结合LWPE损失函数为资源受限环境下的非线性连续函数逼近提供了灵活且几何可解释的解决方案，通过优化基点实现了高效性能。

Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

Conclusion: 建立智能代理的数学框架为理解代理组合和对齐现象提供了理论基础，对AI系统对齐具有重要启示意义。

Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample
efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample
efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the
robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample
efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we
define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow
inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the
control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare
several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an
algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample
efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with
experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency

principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

TL;DR: 本文综述了使用深度强化学习(DRL)和直接偏好优化(DPO)技术来微调大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)的方法，以实现与人类价值观对齐、提升任务性能和自适应多模态交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解方面取得显著进展，但如何通过微调使其与人类价值观对齐并适应特定任务仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 探讨了DRL和DPO两种主要方法：DRL通过奖励信号优化模型行为，DPO直接根据偏好数据对齐策略而无需显式奖励模型。

Result: 分析了不同微调范式的分类、偏好数据来源和奖励信号，并讨论了这些方法在模型对齐和性能提升方面的应用。

Conclusion: DRL和DPO技术为构建鲁棒且与人类对齐的大型视觉语言模型提供了重要途径，但仍面临可扩展性、样本效率、持续学习、泛化性和安全性等开放挑战。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

*Kushal Bose,Swagatam Das*

TL;DR: 提出异步消息传递框架解决GNN中的过度压缩问题，通过基于节点中心性的批处理更新节点特征，在长距离交互任务中取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在长距离交互任务中存在过度压缩问题，图重连方法会破坏归纳偏置且导致信息损失，增加通道容量又会提高参数复杂度

Method: 提出模型无关的异步更新框架，基于节点中心性值创建节点批次，逐层顺序更新特征，避免同时压缩到固定容量通道

Result: 在6个标准图数据集和2个长距离数据集上测试，在REDDIT-BINARY和Peptides-struct上分别获得5%和4%的性能提升

Conclusion: 异步消息传递框架能有效缓解过度压缩问题，保持更高的特征敏感度边界，且不增加模型参数复杂度

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when
tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of
bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes.
Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to
perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive
bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.
Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks
but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these
shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that
asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message
passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the
node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches
will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information
sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into
fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed
framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard
synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets
and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves
impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY
and Peptides-struct, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习在自主导航和运动控制等领域有重要应用，但面临状态-动作空间覆盖有限和长时程任务泛化的挑战

Method: 基于Eikonal偏微分方程推导物理信息正则化损失，结合连续时间最优控制理论，使值函数与代价结构对齐，可与基于时序差分的值学习方法兼容

Result: 与分层隐式Q学习结合的方法(Pi-HIQL)在性能和泛化方面显著提升，特别是在拼接机制和大规模导航任务中表现突出

Conclusion: 物理信息正则化为离线目标条件强化学习提供了有效的几何归纳偏置，能够显著改善值函数学习效果和任务泛化能力

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise
for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting
interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in
practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the
state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on
these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value
learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike
generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our
formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value
functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is
broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be
integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with
Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed
HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and
generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale
navigation tasks.

Motivation: 解决AI能力快速增长与安全进展滞后之间的持续差距，现有安全范式存在脆弱性和反应性问题

Method: 引入R²AI框架，整合快速/慢速安全模型、安全风洞对抗模拟验证、持续反馈循环，实现安全与能力协同进化

Result: 提出了一个可扩展的主动安全路径，能够应对动态环境中的持续安全挑战

Conclusion: safe-by-coevolution和R²AI框架为维持AI在AGI和ASI发展过程中的持续安全提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this position paper, we address the persistent gap between rapidly growing
AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into
``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains
brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety
but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We
therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the
``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety
becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize
this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient
AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats
with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast
and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a
\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and
capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and
proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing
both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances
toward AGI and ASI.

Result: 在离线强化学习基准测试和在线微调任务中，floq性能提升近1.8倍，比标准时序差分学习架构具有更好的容量扩展性。

Conclusion: 迭代计算在价值学习中具有巨大潜力，floq方法通过精细控制积分步骤数量，实现了比传统单块架构更好的Q函数容量扩展和性能表现。

Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of
training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate
computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or
denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

Conclusion: AxelSMOTE通过智能体交互的方式有效解决了传统过采样方法的局限性，为类别不平衡问题提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to
their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to
manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.
Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,
targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This
threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test
samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate
how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key
characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three
predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction
accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and
poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics
effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning
attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for
vulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的OOD检测技术，特别是在严重噪声标签设置下。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了噪声标签条件下的OOD检测挑战，为安全关键AI系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

Conclusion: 实例级实时难度调整能够有效对齐问题难度与模型能力演化，显著提高探索效率和推理性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable
success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration
inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the
model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems
are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are
too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by
quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.
Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR
framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the
high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint
(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous
hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint
length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the
optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In
each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs
collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next
round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem
difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration
efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5
points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided
approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法为中子反射法领域带来了现代优化技术，在保持物理可解释性的同时大大提高了数据分析效率

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and
interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the
physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,
roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is
inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.
lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models
have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.
Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when
replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a
novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by
performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,
automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of
the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these
quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful
modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited
in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case
studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz
film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of
organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library
of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so
that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了神经网络在梯度下降下达到此类解决方案的机制，为理解grokking现象和神经网络学习群论操作的能力提供了新的理论洞见。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with
standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any
finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking
while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe
the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is
typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this
tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate
representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out
many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable
surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank
implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to
approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple
multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank
implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient
matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on
the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient
descent.

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器捕获预训练transformer模型中的概念表示，在实验控制的输入不确定性场景下系统分析幻觉产生机制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了transformer内部处理机制，对AI模型对齐、AI安全、对抗攻击和自动量化幻觉风险具有重要意义。

Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

Abstract: When developing scientific machine learning (ML) approaches, it is often
beneficial to embed knowledge of the physical system in question into the
training process. One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific
characteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid
velocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete
points in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or
computational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data
is ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the
mean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.
Therefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical
characteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector
similarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here
and implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting
problem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in
PIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant
challenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities. The
test case uses PIV data from the highly turbulent flow in the well-known
Transparent Combustion Chamber III (TCC-III) engine. Loss functions based on
the cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences are proposed; the
results show that the vector-based loss functions lead to significantly
improved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns, while a hybrid (vector and
mean-square error) loss function enables a good compromise to be found between
preserving multi-scale behaviour and pixel-wise accuracy.

Abstract: A capillary device is designed and fabricated in glass to work as a fluidic
diode with vanishingly small hydrodynamic conductance for imbibition of water
within a finite range of immersion depths. This is attained through patterning
a section of predefined length on the device surfaces using a single-step
laser-based ablation process and without resorting to chemical treatment of the
hydrophilic glass substrate. While the studied device works as a fluidic diode
for water, it can behave as a conventional capillary slit for the imbibition of
oils (e.g., alkanes, silicone oils) with low surface tension. A prototype
device with simple geometric design is demonstrated for selective adsorption
and separation of water and oil in vertical imbibition experiments at
controlled immersion depths. Efficient devices for passive separation of water
and oil can be designed based on the demonstrated physical mechanism and the
analytical model proposed in this work.

Abstract: This study experimentally investigates bubble size evolution and void
fraction redistribution in an unexplored, coalescence-dominated regime of
decaying turbulent bubbly flow. The flow is generated downstream of a
regenerative pump in a duct, with Taylor-scale Reynolds number
(Re_\lambda~10^3), but turbulence decays rapidly along the duct. Shadowgraph
imaging and particle shadow velocimetry are used for measurements. High-speed
imaging and statistical analysis reveal that bubble coalescence dominates over
breakup across most of the domain, leading to monotonic growth in Sauter mean
diameter (d_{32}) and progressive broadening of the bubble size distribution.
The normalised extreme-to-mean diameter ratio increases axially and
asymptotically saturates at~2.2, indicating the emergence of a
quasi-self-similar bubble size distribution. The probability density function
of bubble diameter exhibits a dual power law tail with exponents $-10/3$ and
-3/2 near the duct inlet, where the flow is coalescence-dominated. However,
after a few hydraulic diameters, a single~-3/2 power law scaling emerges,
indicating a regime of pure coalescence in which all bubbles are smaller than
the Hinze scale. The cumulative distribution with d/d_{32} exponent (~1.3)
emerges only after the size distribution stabilises. Although classical Hinze
scaling gives d_H ~ L^0.9, our theory for d_{32} and~d_{99.8}(99.8th percentile
bubble diameter) in a pure-coalescence regime predicts the slower law~ L^0.5,
which our experimental results confirm, indicating negligible breakup and
sub-Hinze growth. In contrast to current models, transient void fraction
profiles evolve from nearly uniform to sharply core-peaked Gaussian
distributions in the developing regime, with increasing centerline values and
decreasing near-wall values, due to lift-force reversal.

Abstract: We report on the free decay of quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in superfluid
$^4$He confined within nanofluidic channels. Using a pump-probe technique, we
observe a complex decay of the vortex density $L(t)$ that deviates from a
simple power law. The decay exhibits a universal fast transient, scaling as
$L\propto t^{-2}$, followed by a slower non-universal regime that depends on
the geometry and flow conditions. We demonstrate that this behavior is governed
by the interplay between vortex pinning on the disordered topography of the
channel walls and the mobilizing effect of the weak probe flow. A numerical
model that treats pinning as a velocity-dependent effective mutual friction
successfully reproduces the essential features of our experimental
observations.

Abstract: This study develops and validates neural network frameworks with
physics-based constraints for surrogate modeling of rarefied gas dynamics
across different levels of complexity. As a baseline, we first examine the BGK
kinetic relaxation problem and show that reformulating the learning task in
terms of the perturbation from the Maxwell Boltzmann equilibrium ensures
stability and accuracy. Building upon this foundation, we employ Deep Operator
Networks, DeepONets, with physical constraints to address two more challenging
problems. The first is the prediction of the one-dimensional structure of a
standing shock wave in a rarefied polyatomic gas at Mach 5, where the
incorporation of physical constraints avoids overshoot and yields accurate
predictions even for unseen viscosity ratios. The second is the modeling of
two-dimensional rarefied hypersonic flow over a cylinder, where an ensemble of
DeepONets trained on a sparse dataset obtained from the direct simulation Monte
Carlo, DSMC, approach, generalizes successfully to both interpolation and
extrapolation cases up to M equal to 10. A custom weighted loss function
improves the prediction of pressure, while ensemble-based uncertainty
quantification correctly identifies regions of high gradients such as shock
waves. The results demonstrate that embedding physical constraints into neural
operator architectures enables accurate, physically consistent, and
computationally efficient surrogates, paving the way for their application to
multi-dimensional high-speed rarefied flow problems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了旋转球壳中热对流的线性启动，重点分析了机械边界条件和热驱动方式的影响。研究发现外边界的Ekman边界层在完整边界条件下变得不稳定，导致无滑移边界条件的关键Rayleigh数更低。内部加热会提高关键Rayleigh数，并改变对流的空间波数和频率特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旋转球壳中热对流启动的动机在于球壳外表面的Ekman边界层可能会变得不稳定，这一现象在以前的研究中得到的关注较少。边界条件和加热机制对对流启动的具体影响需要系统性的研究，以更好地理解计算模型中这些因素的作用。

Method: 采用谱方法，在中等Ekman数和广泛的Prandtl数及壳形比范围内，确定了关键Rayleigh数、方位角波数和振荡频率。比较了差分加热和内部加热两种热驱动方式，以及不同的边界条件组合（包括无滑移和无应力边界条件）。

Result: 研究发现外边界的Ekman边界层在完整边界条件下变得不稳定，导致无滑移边界条件的关键Rayleigh数（Ra_c）比无应力边界条件更低。内部加热会提高Ra_c，并将启动向更大的波数和频率偏移，同时将关键柱移离切线缸。混合边界条件（内部无滑移）的行为类似于纯无应力边界条件，说明外表面边界在对流启动中起主导作用。

Conclusion: 边界条件和加热机制在控制热对流启动中发挥着核心作用，在行星和恒星内部的模型建立中应该详细考虑这些因素。外边界的特性对对流启动的影响特别显著，这一发现对球壳对流模型的边界条件选择具有重要意义。

Abstract: We investigate the linear onset of thermal convection in rotating spherical
shells with a focus on the influence of mechanical boundary conditions and
thermal driving modes. Using a spectral method, we determine critical Rayleigh
numbers, azimuthal wavenumbers, and oscillation frequencies over a wide range
of Prandtl numbers and shell aspect ratios at moderate Ekman numbers. We show
that the preferred boundary condition for convective onset depends
systematically on both aspect ratio and Prandtl number: for sufficiently thick
shells or for large $\text{Pr}$, the Ekman boundary layer at the outer boundary
becomes destabilising, so that no-slip boundaries yield a lower $\text{Ra}_c$
than stress-free boundaries. Comparing differential and internal heating, we
find that internal heating generally raises $\text{Ra}_c$, shifts the onset to
larger wavenumbers and frequencies, and relocates the critical column away from
the tangent cylinder. Mixed boundary conditions with no-slip on the inner
boundary behave similarly to purely stress-free boundaries, confirming the
dominant influence of the outer surface. These results demonstrate that
boundary conditions and heating mechanisms play a central role in controlling
the onset of convection and should be carefully considered in models of
planetary and stellar interiors.

Abstract: We report three stages for locomotion of a helical swimmer in yield stress
fluids. In the first stage, the swimmer must overcome material's yield strain
to generate rotational motion. However, exceeding the first threshold is not
sufficient for locomotion. Only when the viscous forces are sufficiently strong
to plastically deform the material to a finite distance away from the swimmer,
net locomotion will occur. Once locomotion is underway in the third stage, the
yield stress retards swimming at small pitch angles. Conversely, at large pitch
angles, yield stress dominates the flow by enhancing swimming speed. Flow
visualizations reveal a highly localized flow near the swimmer in yield stress
fluids.

Motivation: 原有的EBIT方法使用分裂方案虽然便于扩展到三维，但限制了高阶时间积分方法的实现，并且在多尺度模拟中边界层物理量重分布困难，因为分裂操作导致界面段前后对应关系丢失。

Conclusion: 非分裂方案增强了EBIT方法的能力，解决了分裂方案的限制，为高阶时间积分和边界层物理量重分布提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: We propose an unsplit scheme for interface advection in a novel
Front-Tracking method, called the Edge-Based Interface Tracking (EBIT) method.
In the EBIT method, the markers are placed on the grid edges, and their
connectivity is implicitly represented using a color vertex field. In our
previous publications, a split scheme was used to advect the interface in the
EBIT method. Although the split scheme facilitates the extension of the EBIT
method to three dimensions, it also imposes some limitations. First,
implementing high-order time integration methods for interface advection
becomes challenging. Second, in multiscale simulations using Front-Tracking
methods with a boundary layer model applied to the interface, the
redistribution of physical quantities inside the boundary layer, such as a
scalar concentration, along the interface becomes difficult due to the loss of
correspondence between interface segments before and after each advection step,
caused by the operator split. Here, we present an unsplit scheme for interface
advection to enhance the capability of the EBIT method. In the unsplit scheme,
a reconstruction step based on a circle fit, similar to that used in the split
scheme, is performed to reposition markers on the cell edges. Furthermore, the
algorithm used to update the color vertex field, which implicitly represents
marker connectivity and distinguishes among ambiguous topology configurations,
is modified to achieve consistent connectivity results. An EBIT method based on
an unsplit scheme has been implemented in the free Basilisk platform, and
validated with four kinematic test cases: translation with uniform velocity,
solid body rotation, Zalesak's disk rotation, and single vortex test. The
results are compared with those obtained using the original EBIT method based
on a split scheme.

Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of Strato-Rotational Instability (SRI)
in a stratified, rotating fluid, focusing on the interaction between axial
modes and spiral components. Through numerical analysis, we find that SRI
induces oscillatory behaviors that change the mean flow, leading to the
selective activation of distinct axial wavenumbers associated with upward and
downward propagating spiral modes. These results suggest wave-mean flow
interactions. The use of Radon Transforms (RT) allowed us to separate these
spiral components, showing that each upward and downward component was
individually modulated, but out of phase with each other. Inspired by the RT
findings, a simplified toy model was developed to interpret the spiral pattern
changes linked to amplitude modulations. The model considers two wave-like
spirals propagating in opposite axial directions, linearly interacting. By
incorporating out-of-phase individual spiral modulations, the model reproduces
the observed spiral pattern transitions, offering a straightforward
interpretation of the underlying physical processes. To explore the mechanism
of individual spiral modulations, we consider a Quasi-Biennial Oscillation
(QBO)-like framework derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating
frame. These findings contribute to a better understanding of low-frequency SRI
dynamics and may offer insights into similar phenomena in geophysical and
astrophysical contexts.

Abstract: Thin flame dynamics in a turbulent flow remains debated, with various
parameterizations proposed for the typical flame propagation velocity.
According to the classical Damk\"ohler's model based on Huygens' principle, a
flame front should advance at a constant velocity normal to the interface
between reactants and products, with a turbulent acceleration induced by the
wrinkling and surface increase of the interface. However, combustion
experiments often deviate from this model due to intertwined thermal and
turbulent effects, complicating flame acceleration characterization. In this
study, we use an autocatalytic reaction that generates a thin reactive front in
an aqueous medium, enabling clearer isolation of turbulence effects. Using
oscillating grids to generate turbulence in a closed tank, we examine two
configurations: a single-grid setup with a spatially decaying turbulence and a
dual-grid system with in the middle, a nearly homogeneous, isotropic
turbulence. Particle Image Velocimetry and Laser Induced Fluorescence
measurements capture both the velocity field and the front propagation,
revealing two different regimes: the expected Huygens' propagation regime, but
also a reactive mixing regime, where the turbulent advection of the products
inside the reactants initiates multiple, dispersed reaction locations.
Additionally, we show that even the small density difference between reactants
and products plays a crucial role in the front dynamics. This work advances our
understanding of autocatalytic fronts in turbulence, emphasizing the critical
interplay between chemical kinetics and flow dynamics.

Abstract: High-pressure combustion is central to modern propulsion and power-generation
systems, where operating pressures often exceed the critical point of working
fluids, resulting in pronounced real-fluid effects that fundamentally alter
thermodynamic and transport properties. High-pressure combustion is central to
modern propulsion and power-generation systems, where operating pressures often
exceed the critical point of working fluids, resulting in pronounced real-fluid
effects that fundamentally alter thermodynamic and transport properties.
Existing methods for quantifying real-fluid behaviors typically rely on
empirical correlations, fitted potentials, and cubic equations of state, which
lack the accuracy required for species coverage and extreme conditions
encountered in combustion processes. As such, this study introduces HiPrFlame,
a novel ab initio-based modeling framework for high-pressure combustion,
designed to deliver unprecedented fidelity in real-fluid property prediction in
high-pressure combustion modeling. HiPrFlame integrates third-order Virial EoS
derived from ab initio intermolecular potentials, thereby real-fluid departure
functions for real-fluid thermodynamics and Enskog theory for real-fluid
transport properties, with all implemented within a versatile OpenFOAM
architecture that can be used for 0-D to 3-D real-fluid modeling. To accelerate
multidimensional simulations, artificial neural network surrogate models are
trained on a comprehensive property database, enabling efficient real-fluid
property updating. The framework is demonstrated through case studies of
high-pressure hydrogen combustion, including homogeneous autoignition and
one-dimensional laminar premixed flames. Results demonstrate that HiPrFlame
accurately captures experimental data for both thermodynamic and transport
properties, significantly outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: A swimming microorganism stirs the surrounding fluid, creating a flow field
that governs not only its locomotion and nutrient uptake, but also its
interactions with other microorganisms and the environment. Despite its
fundamental importance, capturing this flow field and unraveling its biological
implications remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we report the first
direct, time-resolved measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) flow field
generated by a single, free-swimming microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a
widely studied model organism for flagellar motility. Supported by hydrodynamic
modeling and simulations, our measurements resolve how established
two-dimensional (2D) flow features such as in-plane vortices and the stagnation
point emerge from and shape the 3D structure of the algal flow. More
importantly, we reveal unexpected low-Reynolds-number flow phenomena including
micron-sized vortex rings and a periodic train of traveling vortices and
uncover topological changes in the underlying fluid structure associated with
the puller-to-pusher transition of an alga, substantially deepening our
understanding of algal motility. Biologically, access to the complete 3D flow
field enables rigorous quantification of the alga's energy expenditure, as well
as its swimming and feeding efficiency, significantly improving the precision
of these key physiological metrics. Taken together, our study demonstrate
extraordinary vortex dynamics in inertialess flows and advances fundamental
knowledge of microhydrodynamics and its influence on microbial behavior. The
work establishes a powerful method for comprehensively mapping the fluid
environment sculpted by the beating flagella of motile cells.
