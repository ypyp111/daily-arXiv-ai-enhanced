To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted\nusing a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally\nintroducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,\nconsisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for\nfacial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The\ncontinuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort\nassociated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief\nor even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style\ninduced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The\ncrossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but\ndoubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates\nthe importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.\nFacial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most\n(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.\nAmong the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4\nshowed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that\nfacial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived\nrisk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model\nwas implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated\nwell with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective\nperceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and\nhighlighting areas for future research."}

To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and\nuniversal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model\nwithout requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely\non model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward\nscores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator.

Finally, we compute\nrelevant flow quantities along the LEV core, by averaging in planes\nperpendicular to the local vorticity at the LEV core points. We have applied\nthis methodology to flow data corresponding to a pair of wings performing a\nflapping motion in forward flight at moderate Reynolds number. We have\nperformed a geometrical characterization of the LEV, and we have computed\nseveral flow quantities along the LEV core. For the particular configuration\nunder study, we have shown that the LEV, during the first half of the\ndownstroke develops and grows increasing its circulation smoothly.\nApproximately at mid-downstroke the leading edge vortex starts splitting, and\nits downstream part is advected towards the wake while keeping its circulation\nrather constant. Finally, we have briefly explored the link between the\nsectional lift on the wing and the local circulation obtained with the present\nmethodology."}

The pin-fin geometry was parameterized\nusing piecewise cubic splines, producing 1,000 diverse configurations through\nLatin Hypercube Sampling. Each simulation was converted into a graph structure,\nwhere nodes carried a feature vector containing spatial coordinates, a\nnormalized streamwise position, one-hot boundary indicators, and a signed\ndistance to the nearest boundary such as wall. This graph structure served as\ninput to the newly developed Graph Neural Network, which was trained to predict\ntemperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure at each node using data from\nANSYS. The network predicted fields with outstanding accuracy, capturing\nboundary layers, recirculation, and the stagnation region upstream of the\npin-fins while reducing wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In conclusion,\nthe novel graph neural network offered a fast and reliable surrogate for\nsimulations in complex flow configurations."}

In contrast, animals must often learn new\nbehaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We\ntarget this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal\ndecision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires\nmodels flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich\nexternal stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first\npropose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of\npolicy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering\nground-truth rules in simulation.

Using fixed prompt\ntemplates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report\nprimary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and\nLLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark\nperformance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot\nprompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached\n94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over\nfifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).\nIn extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and\nChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though\nsummarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.\nThese results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering\ndeployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while\nprecision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to\nfavor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches.

We argue that first-order\noptimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly\nreshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral\nFusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and\ninformation fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core\nprinciples: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically\nbalances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting\nfrequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or\ntraining pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the\nsecond-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and\nimplement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that\nadaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative\nexponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens\nspectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early\ndecision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains\nhigh. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and\nfixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test\nerror and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches\nbaseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF\nreveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a\nunified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization."}

Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a\ndedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models\nautoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and\n(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal\ngate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights\ninto a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range\ndependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments\non widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Within a simulated environment that models clinical\nconstraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially\nselects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward\nfunction based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy\nthat leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any\nmanually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,\nCryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the\nbest automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human\nexpert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These\nresults highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically\nviable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans."}

In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide\ninformation that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive\nmethods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all\nparts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of\ncertain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make\nnegative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues\nlead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor\nresults in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised\nlearning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This\nframework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new\nself-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation\ntechnique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to\nseveral contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,\nsemi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages."}

SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three\naspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention\narchitectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an\nefficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding\nframework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator\nlibraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.\n  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,\nand SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the\nfeasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.\nSpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer\nbaselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our\nmodels significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver\ninference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.\nFor example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token\nfor 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX\nC550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4\npercent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling\nlow-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of\nbrain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and\nscalable large model design."}

Moreover,\nintegrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires\na significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for\nlow-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for\nsample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).\nTo this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --\nplaced between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The\nhypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,\nvideo), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at\ninference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of\ntraining modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through\nisometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in\nsample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,\nsatellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)\nwith encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality.

The pin-fin geometry was parameterized\nusing piecewise cubic splines, producing 1,000 diverse configurations through\nLatin Hypercube Sampling. Each simulation was converted into a graph structure,\nwhere nodes carried a feature vector containing spatial coordinates, a\nnormalized streamwise position, one-hot boundary indicators, and a signed\ndistance to the nearest boundary such as wall. This graph structure served as\ninput to the newly developed Graph Neural Network, which was trained to predict\ntemperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure at each node using data from\nANSYS.

It covers\ndatasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge\ngaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in\ndatasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction\ntechniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based\nrepresentations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal\napproaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need\nfor greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as\nwell as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather\nthan a text-based challenge."}

While recent progress has\nfocused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,\nexplicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,\nlong-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved\nthrough hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into\nstructured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly\nconstruct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a\nparadigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this\nhierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model\non the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,\ndense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional\nlearning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors\nwith far greater sample efficiency.

ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba\noffer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture\nfine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess\nstrong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning\ncapabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce\n\\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs\nand multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a\nhierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract\nrich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later\nstages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently\nmodel long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for\nsuperior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with\nrespect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through\nextensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic\nsegmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,\nsurpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming\nVision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters.

Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem\nchanges and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional\nclasses can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up\nfinite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes\nare cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover\nthese classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their\nlanguage. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model\n(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up\ninflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000\nhigh-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM\ncomprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed\nabout frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite\nexposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based\nperspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into\nconsideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed\nwith very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as\nexpected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased\nfor inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more\nhapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The\nmodel struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive\nclasses, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive\nclasses. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant\npredictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity\nwere tenuous or absent."}

Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy\nfor decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that\neffective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of\nparameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may\ncause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly\nimpacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.\nHowever, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,\nscalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy.

While recent progress has\nfocused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,\nexplicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,\nlong-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents\ntrained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but\nstructurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces\nand sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in\ndeveloping capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an\nexplicit, hierarchical World Model.

Drawing evidence from a systematic review of\n2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend\ntowards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL).
