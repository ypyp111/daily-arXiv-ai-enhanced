Abstract: Road conditions play an important role in our everyday commute. With the proliferating number of vehicles on the road each year, it has become necessary to access the road conditions very frequently, this would ensure that the traffic also flows smoothly. Even the smallest crack in the road could be easily be chipped into a large pothole due to changing surface temperatures of the road and from the force of vehicles riding over it. In this paper, we have addressed how we could better identify these potholes in realtime with the help of onboard sensors in vehicles so that the data could be useful for analysis and better management of potholes on a large scale. For the implementation, we used an SVM classifier to detect potholes, we achieved 98.1% accuracy based on data collected from a local road for about 2 km which had 26 potholes distributed along the road.

*Kesong Zheng,Zhi Song,Peizhou Li,Shuyi Yao,Zhenxing Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究针对耕地生态系统缺乏标准化栖息地分类系统的问题，开发了包含15类耕地系统栖息地的超高清遥感图像数据集，并提出了动态加权特征融合网络(DWFF-Net)，通过数据级自适应动态加权策略和多层特征融合，显著提升了耕地栖息地分割精度。

Motivation: 当前缺乏耕地生态系统的标准化栖息地分类系统，现有模型无法有效整合语义和纹理特征，导致多尺度栖息地分割精度不足和边界模糊。

Method: 使用冻结参数的DINOv3编码器提取基础特征，引入数据级自适应动态加权策略进行特征融合，解码器采用动态权重计算网络实现多层特征融合，并使用混合损失函数优化训练。

Result: 在构建的数据集上，模型达到0.6979的mIoU和0.8049的F1分数，分别比基线网络提升0.021和0.0161，有效改善了田埂等微栖息地类别的IoU。

Conclusion: 建立了基于自适应多层特征融合的耕地系统栖息地识别框架，能够以低成本实现亚米级精度的栖息地制图，为耕地景观的细粒度栖息地监测提供技术支持。

Abstract: Addressing the current lack of a standardized habitat classification system for cultivated land ecosystems, incomplete coverage of habitat types, and the inability of existing models to effectively integrate semantic and texture features-resulting in insufficient segmentation accuracy and blurred boundaries for multi-scale habitats (e.g., large-scale field plots and micro-habitats)-this study developed a comprehensively annotated ultra-high-resolution remote sensing image dataset encompassing 15 categories of cultivated land system habitats. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-Weighted Feature Fusion Network (DWFF-Net). The encoder of this model utilizes a frozen-parameter DINOv3 to extract foundational features. By analyzing the relationships between different category images and feature maps, we introduce a data-level adaptive dynamic weighting strategy for feature fusion. The decoder incorporates a dynamic weight computation network to achieve thorough integration of multi-layer features, and a hybrid loss function is adopted to optimize model training. Experimental results on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.6979 and an F1-score of 0.8049, outperforming the baseline network by 0.021 and 0.0161, respectively. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary nature of multi-layer feature fusion, which effectively improves the IoU for micro-habitat categories such as field ridges. This study establishes a habitat identification framework for cultivated land systems based on adaptive multi-layer feature fusion, enabling sub-meter precision habitat mapping at a low cost and providing robust technical support for fine-grained habitat monitoring in cultivated landscapes.

### [4] [AGENet: Adaptive Edge-aware Geodesic Distance Learning for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11662)
*Ziyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGENet是一个用于医学图像分割的少样本学习框架，通过边缘感知测地距离学习来改善边界分割精度，无需大量标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量标注数据，这在临床应用中构成瓶颈。现有少样本分割方法在医学图像边界分割上表现不佳，特别是当解剖结构相似且缺乏空间上下文时。

Method: 结合三个主要组件：(1)边缘感知测地距离学习模块，通过迭代快速行进细化来尊重解剖边界；(2)自适应原型提取，通过空间加权聚合捕获全局结构和局部边界细节；(3)自适应参数学习，自动适应不同器官特征。

Result: 在多个医学影像数据集上的广泛实验表明，相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，特别是在减少边界误差方面，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: AGENet在有限标注数据下实现了精确的医学图像分割，计算轻量且适合临床应用。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires large annotated datasets, creating a significant bottleneck for clinical applications. While few-shot segmentation methods can learn from minimal examples, existing approaches demonstrate suboptimal performance in precise boundary delineation for medical images, particularly when anatomically similar regions appear without sufficient spatial context. We propose AGENet (Adaptive Geodesic Edge-aware Network), a novel framework that incorporates spatial relationships through edge-aware geodesic distance learning. Our key insight is that medical structures follow predictable geometric patterns that can guide prototype extraction even with limited training data. Unlike methods relying on complex architectural components or heavy neural networks, our approach leverages computationally lightweight geometric modeling. The framework combines three main components: (1) An edge-aware geodesic distance learning module that respects anatomical boundaries through iterative Fast Marching refinement, (2) adaptive prototype extraction that captures both global structure and local boundary details via spatially-weighted aggregation, and (3) adaptive parameter learning that automatically adjusts to different organ characteristics. Extensive experiments across diverse medical imaging datasets demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method reduces boundary errors compared to existing approaches while maintaining computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for clinical applications requiring precise segmentation with limited annotated data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPSegFZ是一个无需预训练的少样本和零样本3D点云语义分割网络，通过原型增强注意力机制和语言引导原型嵌入，在S3DIS和ScanNet基准上分别超越现有最佳方法5.68%和3.82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本3D点云分割方法过度依赖预训练阶段，限制了模型灵活性；同时未能充分利用支持集中的文本注释等信息，影响了模型性能和零样本能力。

Method: 提出EPSegFZ网络，包含三个核心组件：原型增强寄存器注意力模块、基于双相对位置编码的交叉注意力机制、以及语言引导原型嵌入模块，实现无需预训练的特征提取和查询-原型对应关系构建。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中，分别比现有最佳方法提升了5.68%和3.82%的性能，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: EPSegFZ通过消除预训练依赖和充分利用多模态信息，显著提升了少样本和零样本3D点云分割的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent approaches for few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation typically require a two-stage learning process, i.e., a pre-training stage followed by a few-shot training stage. While effective, these methods face overreliance on pre-training, which hinders model flexibility and adaptability. Some models tried to avoid pre-training yet failed to capture ample information. In addition, current approaches focus on visual information in the support set and neglect or do not fully exploit other useful data, such as textual annotations. This inadequate utilization of support information impairs the performance of the model and restricts its zero-shot ability. To address these limitations, we present a novel pre-training-free network, named Efficient Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for Few- and Zero-shot scenarios. Our EPSegFZ incorporates three key components. A Prototype-Enhanced Registers Attention (ProERA) module and a Dual Relative Positional Encoding (DRPE)-based cross-attention mechanism for improved feature extraction and accurate query-prototype correspondence construction without pre-training. A Language-Guided Prototype Embedding (LGPE) module that effectively leverages textual information from the support set to improve few-shot performance and enable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 5.68% and 3.82% on the S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks, respectively.

### [6] [Task-Aware 3D Affordance Segmentation via 2D Guidance and Geometric Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11702)
*Lian He,Meng Liu,Qilang Ye,Yu Zhou,Xiang Deng,Gangyi Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TASA是一个用于3D场景级可操作性分割的新框架，通过联合利用2D语义线索和3D几何推理，在准确性和效率上都显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注对象级可操作性或将2D预测简单提升到3D，忽略了点云中的丰富几何结构信息且计算成本高。

Method: TASA采用从粗到细的方式，包含任务感知的2D可操作性检测模块来识别可操作点，以及3D可操作性细化模块来整合2D语义先验与局部3D几何信息。

Result: 在SceneFun3D数据集上的实验表明，TASA在场景级可操作性分割的准确性和效率上都显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TASA通过联合利用2D语义和3D几何信息，有效解决了3D场景级可操作性分割的挑战，为具身智能体在复杂环境中的交互提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scene-level affordances from natural language instructions is essential for enabling embodied agents to interact meaningfully in complex environments. However, this task remains challenging due to the need for semantic reasoning and spatial grounding. Existing methods mainly focus on object-level affordances or merely lift 2D predictions to 3D, neglecting rich geometric structure information in point clouds and incurring high computational costs. To address these limitations, we introduce Task-Aware 3D Scene-level Affordance segmentation (TASA), a novel geometry-optimized framework that jointly leverages 2D semantic cues and 3D geometric reasoning in a coarse-to-fine manner. To improve the affordance detection efficiency, TASA features a task-aware 2D affordance detection module to identify manipulable points from language and visual inputs, guiding the selection of task-relevant views. To fully exploit 3D geometric information, a 3D affordance refinement module is proposed to integrate 2D semantic priors with local 3D geometry, resulting in accurate and spatially coherent 3D affordance masks. Experiments on SceneFun3D demonstrate that TASA significantly outperforms the baselines in both accuracy and efficiency in scene-level affordance segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LE-CapsNet作为CapsNet的轻量、增强且更准确的变体，在CIFAR-10上达到76.73%准确率，推理速度比CapsNet快4倍，在AffNIST上达到94.3%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet虽然比CNN在检测重叠类别和变换图像方面有优势，但速度慢、资源消耗大、参数多且准确率不如CNN。

Method: 开发LE-CapsNet作为CapsNet的轻量增强版本，使用380万权重参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上达到76.73%准确率，推理速度比CapsNet快4倍；在AffNIST数据集上达到94.3%准确率，优于CapsNet的90.52%。

Conclusion: LE-CapsNet在保持CapsNet优势的同时，显著提升了准确率、速度和效率，对仿射变换图像检测更加鲁棒。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) classifier has several advantages over CNNs, including better detection of images containing overlapping categories and higher accuracy on transformed images. Despite the advantages, CapsNet is slow due to its different structure. In addition, CapsNet is resource-hungry, includes many parameters and lags in accuracy compared to CNNs. In this work, we propose LE-CapsNet as a light, enhanced and more accurate variant of CapsNet. Using 3.8M weights, LECapsNet obtains 76.73% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset while performing inference 4x faster than CapsNet. In addition, our proposed network is more robust at detecting images with affine transformations compared to CapsNet. We achieve 94.3% accuracy on the AffNIST dataset (compared to CapsNet 90.52%).

*Zhou Xu,Qi Wang,Yuxiao Yang,Luyuan Zhang,Zhang Liang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Target-Balanced Score Distillation (TBSD)方法，通过多目标优化和自适应策略解决了SDS方法在纹理优化和形状保持之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SDS方法在3D资产生成中存在过饱和和过度平滑问题，而引入负提示的变体方法面临纹理优化有限或形状失真的关键权衡。

Method: 提出TBSD方法，将生成建模为多目标优化问题，采用自适应策略平衡目标负提示的使用，有效解决纹理-形状权衡。

Result: 大量实验表明TBSD显著优于现有最先进方法，生成具有高保真纹理和几何精确形状的3D资产。

Conclusion: TBSD通过系统性分析和自适应优化策略，成功解决了SDS方法中纹理保真度和形状准确性之间的根本权衡问题。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables 3D asset generation by distilling priors from pretrained 2D text-to-image diffusion models, but vanilla SDS suffers from over-saturation and over-smoothing. To mitigate this issue, recent variants have incorporated negative prompts. However, these methods face a critical trade-off: limited texture optimization, or significant texture gains with shape distortion. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis and reveal that this trade-off is fundamentally governed by the utilization of the negative prompts, where Target Negative Prompts (TNP) that embed target information in the negative prompts dramatically enhancing texture realism and fidelity but inducing shape distortions. Informed by this key insight, we introduce the Target-Balanced Score Distillation (TBSD). It formulates generation as a multi-objective optimization problem and introduces an adaptive strategy that effectively resolves the aforementioned trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TBSD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, yielding 3D assets with high-fidelity textures and geometrically accurate shape.

*Sudhakar Sah,Nikhil Chabbra,Matthieu Durnerin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompressNAS是一个基于微神经架构搜索的框架，通过全局搜索秩选择来压缩深度卷积神经网络，在保持精度的同时实现显著的模型压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度卷积神经网络在微控制器和轻量级NPU上部署困难，现有低秩张量分解方法局部选择秩，忽略了压缩与精度之间的全局权衡。

Method: 采用MicroNAS启发的框架，将秩选择视为全局搜索问题，使用快速精度评估器在内存和精度约束下高效探索候选分解。

Result: 在ImageNet上压缩ResNet-18达8倍，精度下降小于4%；在COCO上压缩YOLOv5s达2倍无精度损失，压缩YOLOv5n达2倍仅损失2.5%精度；提出新的压缩模型家族STResNet。

Conclusion: CompressNAS能够有效压缩深度神经网络，在保持竞争力的性能同时显著减少模型大小和计算需求。

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are increasingly difficult to deploy on microcontrollers (MCUs) and lightweight NPUs (Neural Processing Units) due to their growing size and compute demands. Low-rank tensor decomposition, such as Tucker factorization, is a promising way to reduce parameters and operations with reasonable accuracy loss. However, existing approaches select ranks locally and often ignore global trade-offs between compression and accuracy. We introduce CompressNAS, a MicroNAS-inspired framework that treats rank selection as a global search problem. CompressNAS employs a fast accuracy estimator to evaluate candidate decompositions, enabling efficient yet exhaustive rank exploration under memory and accuracy constraints. In ImageNet, CompressNAS compresses ResNet-18 by 8x with less than 4% accuracy drop; on COCO, we achieve 2x compression of YOLOv5s without any accuracy drop and 2x compression of YOLOv5n with a 2.5% drop. Finally, we present a new family of compressed models, STResNet, with competitive performance compared to other efficient models.

*Jiao Chen,Haoyi Wang,Jianhua Tang,Junyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptFly是一个无需权重更新的测试时自适应框架，通过提示引导调整分割模型，支持资源受限和资源丰富的无人机两种互补适应模式，实现跨无人机知识共享和协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机网络中语义分割模型在天气、光照和视角变化下性能下降的问题，同时克服资源受限无人机无法运行基于梯度的测试时自适应，以及资源丰富无人机独立适应浪费共享经验的问题。

Method: 提出两种适应模式：资源受限无人机使用轻量级token提示检索从共享全局内存；资源丰富无人机使用基于协方差矩阵自适应进化策略的无梯度稀疏视觉提示优化。通过激活统计检测器触发适应，跨无人机知识池整合提示知识。

Result: 在UAVid和VDD基准测试以及真实无人机部署中，AdaptFly显著提高了分割精度和鲁棒性，优于静态模型和最先进的TTA基线方法。

Conclusion: AdaptFly为新兴低空经济中的弹性、通信高效感知提供了一条实用路径，实现了无人机群范围内的协作感知。

Abstract: Low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks rely on robust semantic segmentation as a foundational enabler for distributed sensing-communication-control co-design across heterogeneous agents within the network. However, segmentation foundation models deteriorate quickly under weather, lighting, and viewpoint drift. Resource-limited UAVs cannot run gradient-based test-time adaptation, while resource-massive UAVs adapt independently, wasting shared experience. To address these challenges, we propose AdaptFly, a prompt-guided test-time adaptation framework that adjusts segmentation models without weight updates. AdaptFly features two complementary adaptation modes. For resource-limited UAVs, it employs lightweight token-prompt retrieval from a shared global memory. For resource-massive UAVs, it uses gradient-free sparse visual prompt optimization via Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. An activation-statistic detector triggers adaptation, while cross-UAV knowledge pool consolidates prompt knowledge and enables fleet-wide collaboration with negligible bandwidth overhead. Extensive experiments on UAVid and VDD benchmarks, along with real-world UAV deployments under diverse weather conditions, demonstrate that AdaptFly significantly improves segmentation accuracy and robustness over static models and state-of-the-art TTA baselines. The results highlight a practical path to resilient, communication-efficient perception in the emerging low-altitude economy.

*Zekai Shi,Zhixi Cai,Kalin Stefanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物合理性的自监督视觉表征学习方法，通过模拟人眼盲点的掩码策略来学习词汇-指称映射


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童学习第一词汇时面临词汇指称不确定性问题，需要从生态有效的体验数据中学习视觉表征

Method: 使用基于掩码自编码器的视觉骨干网络，引入模拟人眼盲点的掩码策略，结合对比学习的视频-文本模型

Result: 提出的生物合理掩码策略在词汇-指称映射学习中至少与随机掩码同样有效

Conclusion: 生物启发的掩码策略为从跨情境和时间扩展的片段中学习词汇-指称映射提供了有效方法

Abstract: Typically, children start to learn their first words between 6 and 9 months, linking spoken utterances to their visual referents. Without prior knowledge, a word encountered for the first time can be interpreted in countless ways; it might refer to any of the objects in the environment, their components, or attributes. Using longitudinal, egocentric, and ecologically valid data from the experience of one child, in this work, we propose a self-supervised and biologically plausible strategy to learn strong visual representations. Our masked autoencoder-based visual backbone incorporates knowledge about the blind spot in human eyes to define a novel masking strategy. This mask and reconstruct approach attempts to mimic the way the human brain fills the gaps in the eyes' field of view. This represents a significant shift from standard random masking strategies, which are difficult to justify from a biological perspective. The pretrained encoder is utilized in a contrastive learning-based video-text model capable of acquiring word-referent mappings. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed biologically plausible masking strategy is at least as effective as random masking for learning word-referent mappings from cross-situational and temporally extended episodes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GROVER是一个用于空间多组学数据自适应融合的新框架，通过图卷积网络和对比学习解决多模态异构数据的整合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学、蛋白质组学和表观基因组学缺乏病理形态学背景，需要与组织病理学图像整合以进行全面的疾病组织分析，但多模态数据的异质性和分辨率不匹配带来了重大挑战。

Method: 使用基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的图卷积网络编码器捕获模态间非线性依赖关系，引入点-特征对对比学习策略优化跨模态对应关系，并设计动态专家路由机制自适应选择信息丰富的模态。

Result: 在真实世界空间组学数据集上的实验表明，GROVER优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: GROVER为多模态整合提供了一个稳健可靠的解决方案，能够有效处理空间多组学数据的融合问题。

Abstract: Effectively modeling multimodal spatial omics data is critical for understanding tissue complexity and underlying biological mechanisms. While spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics capture molecular features, they lack pathological morphological context. Integrating these omics with histopathological images is therefore essential for comprehensive disease tissue analysis. However, substantial heterogeneity across omics, imaging, and spatial modalities poses significant challenges. Naive fusion of semantically distinct sources often leads to ambiguous representations. Additionally, the resolution mismatch between high-resolution histology images and lower-resolution sequencing spots complicates spatial alignment. Biological perturbations during sample preparation further distort modality-specific signals, hindering accurate integration. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-guided Representation of Omics and Vision with Expert Regulation for Adaptive Spatial Multi-omics Fusion (GROVER), a novel framework for adaptive integration of spatial multi-omics data. GROVER leverages a Graph Convolutional Network encoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to capture the nonlinear dependencies between each modality and its associated spatial structure, thereby producing expressive, modality-specific embeddings. To align these representations, we introduce a spot-feature-pair contrastive learning strategy that explicitly optimizes the correspondence across modalities at each spot. Furthermore, we design a dynamic expert routing mechanism that adaptively selects informative modalities for each spot while suppressing noisy or low-quality inputs. Experiments on real-world spatial omics datasets demonstrate that GROVER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing a robust and reliable solution for multimodal integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSI-Detect是一个两阶段检测方法，通过将RGB图像重建为31通道高光谱图像，在高光谱域进行Deepfake检测，相比RGB域方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成和扩散模型能产生高度逼真的图像，可能误导人类感知和自动化检测系统。大多数检测方法只在RGB空间分析三个光谱通道，限制了检测能力。

Method: 提出HSI-Detect两阶段流程：首先从标准RGB输入重建31通道高光谱图像，然后在高光谱域进行检测。通过扩展输入表示到更密集的光谱带，放大在RGB域中微弱或不可见的操作伪影。

Result: 在FaceForensics++数据集上的评估显示，相比仅使用RGB的基线方法，HSI-Detect取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: 光谱域映射在Deepfake检测中具有良好前景，高光谱分析能有效增强检测能力。

Abstract: Modern generative and diffusion models produce highly realistic images that can mislead human perception and even sophisticated automated detection systems. Most detection methods operate in RGB space and thus analyze only three spectral channels. We propose HSI-Detect, a two-stage pipeline that reconstructs a 31-channel hyperspectral image from a standard RGB input and performs detection in the hyperspectral domain. Expanding the input representation into denser spectral bands amplifies manipulation artifacts that are often weak or invisible in the RGB domain, particularly in specific frequency bands. We evaluate HSI-Detect across FaceForensics++ dataset and show the consistent improvements over RGB-only baselines, illustrating the promise of spectral-domain mapping for Deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究点云神经网络是否保持对称感知距离的bi-Lipschitz等价性，发现标准不变网络不满足此性质，提出改进方法并在3D点云对应任务中验证优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受等变学习文献启发，研究点云神经网络是否保持自然对称感知距离的bi-Lipschitz等价性，以提升模型性能。

Method: 分析两种对称感知度量（Procrustes匹配和Hard Gromov Wasserstein距离）的bi-Lipschitz等价性，修改标准不变网络以获得bi-Lipschitz保证。

Result: 两种距离本身不等价，标准不变网络不满足bi-Lipschitz性质；改进后的模型在3D点云对应任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过确保bi-Lipschitz性质，可以改进点云不变网络的性能，特别是在保持对称感知距离方面。

Abstract: Many neural networks for point clouds are, by design, invariant to the symmetries of this datatype: permutations and rigid motions. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether such networks preserve natural symmetry aware distances on the point cloud spaces, through the notion of bi-Lipschitz equivalence. This inquiry is motivated by recent work in the Equivariant learning literature which highlights the advantages of bi-Lipschitz models in other scenarios.
  We consider two symmetry aware metrics on point clouds: (a) The Procrustes Matching (PM) metric and (b) Hard Gromov Wasserstien distances. We show that these two distances themselves are not bi-Lipschitz equivalent, and as a corollary deduce that popular invariant networks for point clouds are not bi-Lipschitz with respect to the PM metric. We then show how these networks can be modified so that they do obtain bi-Lipschitz guarantees. Finally, we provide initial experiments showing the advantage of the proposed bi-Lipschitz model over standard invariant models, for the tasks of finding correspondences between 3D point clouds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型虽然预测准确，但缺乏决策解释性，经常在遇到分布外数据时产生幻觉事实。现有神经符号方法仅从任务标签中提取符号，缺乏对视觉数据的充分基础。

Method: 使用多模态概念生成器从训练图像中挖掘判别性视觉概念，然后用这些概念条件化符号发现，通过大型语言模型推理器将符号组合成一阶规则，最后在推理时通过视觉验证器量化符号存在度并执行规则。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) deliver impressive predictive accuracy yet offer little insight into 'why' a decision is reached, frequently hallucinating facts, particularly when encountering out-of-distribution data. Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型隐式稀疏风格的Transformer变体架构——Batch Transformers，通过关注重要维度（主成分）而非完整维度，显著减少编码器-解码器ANN架构中的瓶颈大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对序列或批处理实体的整个维度进行注意力计算，导致计算复杂度高。本文旨在通过关注重要维度来降低模型复杂度，提高效率。

Method: 提出Batch Transformers架构，采用隐式稀疏风格，仅对重要维度（主成分）进行注意力计算，实现特征选择，从而减少编码器-解码器架构的瓶颈大小。

Result: 在面部识别任务的合成图像生成中，针对化妆和遮挡数据集进行测试，结果表明该架构能够有效增加有限原始数据集的变异性。

Conclusion: Batch Transformers通过关注重要维度的注意力机制，成功降低了模型复杂度，同时在数据增强任务中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: A novel Transformer variation architecture is proposed in the implicit sparse style. Unlike "traditional" Transformers, instead of attention to sequential or batch entities in their entirety of whole dimensionality, in the proposed Batch Transformers, attention to the "important" dimensions (primary components) is implemented. In such a way, the "important" dimensions or feature selection allows for a significant reduction of the bottleneck size in the encoder-decoder ANN architectures. The proposed architecture is tested on the synthetic image generation for the face recognition task in the case of the makeup and occlusion data set, allowing for increased variability of the limited original data set.

TL;DR: Image-POSER是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过动态任务分解和专家模型编排来处理长文本提示的图像生成，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在处理长而复杂的创意工作流程提示时表现不佳，需要能够可靠执行组合式提示的系统。

Method: 采用反射式强化学习框架，编排预训练的文本到图像和图像到图像专家模型，通过动态任务分解处理端到端的长文本提示，并使用视觉语言模型批评器进行结构化反馈监督。

Result: 在行业标准和自定义基准测试中，Image-POSER在一致性、保真度和美学方面优于基线方法和前沿模型，并在人类评估中持续获得偏好。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以赋予AI系统自主分解、重新排序和组合视觉模型的能力，朝着通用视觉助手的方向发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generation have produced strong single-shot models, yet no individual system reliably executes the long, compositional prompts typical of creative workflows. We introduce Image-POSER, a reflective reinforcement learning framework that (i) orchestrates a diverse registry of pretrained text-to-image and image-to-image experts, (ii) handles long-form prompts end-to-end through dynamic task decomposition, and (iii) supervises alignment at each step via structured feedback from a vision-language model critic. By casting image synthesis and editing as a Markov Decision Process, we learn non-trivial expert pipelines that adaptively combine strengths across models. Experiments show that Image-POSER outperforms baselines, including frontier models, across industry-standard and custom benchmarks in alignment, fidelity, and aesthetics, and is consistently preferred in human evaluations. These results highlight that reinforcement learning can endow AI systems with the capacity to autonomously decompose, reorder, and combine visual models, moving towards general-purpose visual assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在遮挡、尺度变化和时序漂移下，单目标跟踪和短期运动预测难以保持时序一致性的问题，这些因素会破坏实时感知所需的时序连贯性。

Method: 使用基于真实值初始化的记忆和燃烧锚点损失来稳定初始化，通过单个轻量级时序注意力层跨帧优化嵌入表示，实现固定GPU内存的实时推理。

Result: 在Mini-LaSOT基准测试上达到76.3 AUC和53.7 FPS（4.3GB显存），在快速运动、尺度变化和遮挡情况下优于TrackFormer和MOTRv2等transformer基线模型。

Conclusion: SOTFormer通过统一的端到端框架，在保持实时性能的同时，显著提升了在挑战性场景下的跟踪和预测精度。

Abstract: Accurate single-object tracking and short-term motion forecasting remain challenging under occlusion, scale variation, and temporal drift, which disrupt the temporal coherence required for real-time perception. We introduce \textbf{SOTFormer}, a minimal constant-memory temporal transformer that unifies object detection, tracking, and short-horizon trajectory prediction within a single end-to-end framework. Unlike prior models with recurrent or stacked temporal encoders, SOTFormer achieves stable identity propagation through a ground-truth-primed memory and a burn-in anchor loss that explicitly stabilizes initialization. A single lightweight temporal-attention layer refines embeddings across frames, enabling real-time inference with fixed GPU memory. On the Mini-LaSOT (20%) benchmark, SOTFormer attains 76.3 AUC and 53.7 FPS (AMP, 4.3 GB VRAM), outperforming transformer baselines such as TrackFormer and MOTRv2 under fast motion, scale change, and occlusion.

TL;DR: 提出MP-GFormer，一种3D几何感知的动态图变换器，通过注意力机制将演化的3D几何表示集成到动态图学习中，用于预测加工操作序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图学习方法在加工工艺规划中虽然能捕捉时空依赖关系，但无法纳入零件的三维几何信息，缺乏领域感知能力。

Method: 使用StereoLithography表面网格表示每次加工操作后零件的3D几何，通过注意力机制将演化的3D几何表示集成到动态图学习中。

Result: 在合成数据集上评估，与最先进方法相比，主要操作和子操作预测的准确率分别提高了24%和36%。

Conclusion: MP-GFormer通过整合3D几何信息显著提升了加工操作序列预测的准确性，为加工工艺规划提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machining process planning (MP) is inherently complex due to structural and geometrical dependencies among part features and machining operations. A key challenge lies in capturing dynamic interdependencies that evolve with distinct part geometries as operations are performed. Machine learning has been applied to address challenges in MP, such as operation selection and machining sequence prediction. Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences. Our approach leverages StereoLithography surface meshes representing the 3D geometry of a part after each machining operation, with the boundary representation method used for the initial 3D designs. We evaluate MP-GFormer on a synthesized dataset and demonstrate that the method achieves improvements of 24\% and 36\% in accuracy for main and sub-operation predictions, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MergeGuard是一个双阶段权重保护框架，通过重新分配任务相关信息和在损失景观中注入结构化扰动，破坏模型合并兼容性，防止未经授权的模型合并。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型和开放存储库的快速扩散使得模型合并成为一种方便但有风险的做法，未经授权的模型合并不仅侵犯知识产权，还破坏模型所有权和问责制。

Method: 第一阶段通过L2正则化优化在层间重新分配任务相关信息；第二阶段注入结构化扰动以错配任务子空间，破坏损失景观中的曲率兼容性。

Result: 在视觉（ViT-L-14）和语言（Llama2、Gemma2、Mistral）模型上的实验表明，MergeGuard将合并模型准确率降低高达90%，而保护模型的性能损失不到1.5%。

Conclusion: MergeGuard通过重塑模型参数几何形状，使合并模型崩溃为破坏性干扰，同时保护模型保持完全功能，有效防止未经授权的模型合并。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of pretrained models and open repositories has made model merging a convenient yet risky practice, allowing free-riders to combine fine-tuned models into a new multi-capability model without authorization. Such unauthorized model merging not only violates intellectual property rights but also undermines model ownership and accountability. To address this issue, we present MergeGuard, a proactive dual-stage weight protection framework that disrupts merging compatibility while maintaining task fidelity. In the first stage, we redistribute task-relevant information across layers via L2-regularized optimization, ensuring that important gradients are evenly dispersed. In the second stage, we inject structured perturbations to misalign task subspaces, breaking curvature compatibility in the loss landscape. Together, these stages reshape the model's parameter geometry such that merged models collapse into destructive interference while the protected model remains fully functional. Extensive experiments on both vision (ViT-L-14) and language (Llama2, Gemma2, Mistral) models demonstrate that MergeGuard reduces merged model accuracy by up to 90% with less than 1.5% performance loss on the protected model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床实践中对精确诊断和治疗干预至关重要，但大多数分割模型没有显式编码边界信息，导致边界保持成为持续挑战。

Method: 提出FocusSDF损失函数，基于符号距离函数，通过自适应权重分配使网络专注于边界区域，使其具有边界感知能力。

Result: 在涵盖脑动脉瘤、中风、肝脏和乳腺肿瘤分割任务的多个数据集上，与包括MedSAM在内的五种最先进模型和四种基于距离的损失函数进行比较，FocusSDF始终表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: FocusSDF在医学图像分割中优于现有的基于距离变换的损失函数，能有效提升边界区域的关注度和分割精度。

Abstract: Segmentation of medical images constitutes an essential component of medical image analysis, providing the foundation for precise diagnosis and efficient therapeutic interventions in clinical practices. Despite substantial progress, most segmentation models do not explicitly encode boundary information; as a result, making boundary preservation a persistent challenge in medical image segmentation. To address this challenge, we introduce FocusSDF, a novel loss function based on the signed distance functions (SDFs), which redirects the network to concentrate on boundary regions by adaptively assigning higher weights to pixels closer to the lesion or organ boundary, effectively making it boundary aware. To rigorously validate FocusSDF, we perform extensive evaluations against five state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models, including the foundation model MedSAM, using four distance-based loss functions across diverse datasets covering cerebral aneurysm, stroke, liver, and breast tumor segmentation tasks spanning multiple imaging modalities. The experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of FocusSDF over existing distance transform based loss functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物调查方法资源密集且受限于后勤挑战，而深度学习目标检测模型在稀疏分布物种（如麝牛）上因训练数据有限而效果不佳。

Method: 比较了仅使用真实图像的基线模型与5个零样本和5个少样本模型，这些模型在训练集中逐步加入更多合成图像。

Result: 零样本模型中，添加合成图像提高了检测性能，但超过基线训练数据集100%后出现收益递减；少样本模型中，真实图像与合成图像结合可提高召回率和整体准确率，但改进不显著。

Conclusion: 合成图像在数据稀缺时能有效训练准确的目标检测模型，为监测稀有或难以接近物种提供了重要视角，可在没有真实数据时启动模型并随时间推移逐步优化。

Abstract: Accurate population estimates are essential for wildlife management, providing critical insights into species abundance and distribution. Traditional survey methods, including visual aerial counts and GNSS telemetry tracking, are widely used to monitor muskox populations in Arctic regions. These approaches are resource intensive and constrained by logistical challenges. Advances in remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and high resolution aerial imagery offer promising alternatives for wildlife detection. Yet, the effectiveness of deep learning object detection models (ODMs) is often limited by small datasets, making it challenging to train robust ODMs for sparsely distributed species like muskoxen. This study investigates the integration of synthetic imagery (SI) to supplement limited training data and improve muskox detection in zero shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) settings. We compared a baseline model trained on real imagery with 5 ZS and 5 FS models that incorporated progressively more SI in the training set. For the ZS models, where no real images were included in the training set, adding SI improved detection performance. As more SI were added, performance in precision, recall and F1 score increased, but eventually plateaued, suggesting diminishing returns when SI exceeded 100% of the baseline model training dataset. For FS models, combining real and SI led to better recall and slightly higher overall accuracy compared to using real images alone, though these improvements were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SI to train accurate ODMs when data is scarce, offering important perspectives for wildlife monitoring by enabling rare or inaccessible species to be monitored and to increase monitoring frequency. This approach could be used to initiate ODMs without real data and refine it as real images are acquired over time.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) show promise for diverse imaging tasks but often underperform on medical benchmarks. Prior efforts to improve performance include model finetuning, which requires large domain-specific datasets and significant compute, or manual prompt engineering, which is hard to generalize and often inaccessible to medical institutions seeking to deploy these tools. These challenges motivate interest in approaches that draw on a model's embedded knowledge while abstracting away dependence on human-designed prompts to enable scalable, weight-agnostic performance improvements. To explore this, we adapt the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) framework for structured automated prompt optimization in medical vision-language systems through a comprehensive, formal evaluation. We implement prompting pipelines for five medical imaging tasks across radiology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, evaluating 10 open-source VLMs with four prompt optimization techniques. Optimized pipelines achieved a median relative improvement of 53% over zero-shot prompting baselines, with the largest gains ranging from 300% to 3,400% on tasks where zero-shot performance is low. These results highlight the substantial potential of applying automated prompt optimization to medical AI systems, demonstrating significant gains for vision-based applications requiring accurate clinical image interpretation. By reducing dependence on prompt design to elicit intended outputs, these techniques allow clinicians to focus on patient care and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, our experiments offer scalability and preserve data privacy, demonstrating performance improvement on open-source VLMs. We publicly release our evaluation pipelines to support reproducible research on specialized medical tasks, available at https://github.com/DaneshjouLab/prompt-triage-lab.

Abstract: Medical imaging and multi-modal clinical settings often face the challange of missing modality in their diagnostic pipelines. Existing imputation methods either lack representational capacity or are computationally expensive. We propose PI-NAIM, a novel dual-path architecture that dynamically routes samples to optimized imputation approaches based on missingness complexity. Our framework integrates: (1) intelligent path routing that directs low missingness samples to efficient statistical imputation (MICE) and complex patterns to powerful neural networks (GAIN with temporal analysis); (2) cross-path attention fusion that leverages missingness-aware embeddings to intelligently combine both branches; and (3) end-to-end joint optimization of imputation accuracy and downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving RMSE of 0.108 (vs. baselines' 0.119-0.152) and substantial gains in downstream tasks with an AUROC of 0.812 for mortality prediction. PI-NAIM's modular design enables seamless integration into vision pipelines handling incomplete sensor measurements, missing modalities, or corrupted inputs, providing a unified solution for real-world scenario.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中面临的视觉token数量线性增长导致的注意力成本、内存和延迟爆炸问题。

Method: 使用交叉注意力对视觉token评分，基于查询复杂度预测实例特定的保留预算，通过可微分直通估计器选择Top-n token，并利用小型重编码器保持时间顺序。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL中集成QTSplus，视觉流压缩达89%，端到端延迟减少28%，在八个长视频理解基准测试中保持接近原始模型的准确率，在TempCompass方向准确率和顺序准确率上分别提升20.5和5.6个百分点。

Conclusion: QTSplus是一种有效且通用的机制，能够在保留任务相关证据的同时，将多模态大语言模型扩展到现实世界长视频场景。

Abstract: Despite the recent advances in the video understanding ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), long video understanding remains a challenge. One of the main issues is that the number of vision tokens grows linearly with video length, which causes an explosion in attention cost, memory, and latency. To solve this challenge, we present Query-aware Token Selector (\textbf{QTSplus}), a lightweight yet powerful visual token selection module that serves as an information gate between the vision encoder and LLMs. Given a text query and video tokens, QTSplus dynamically selects the most important visual evidence for the input text query by (i) scoring visual tokens via cross-attention, (ii) \emph{predicting} an instance-specific retention budget based on the complexity of the query, and (iii) \emph{selecting} Top-$n$ tokens with a differentiable straight-through estimator during training and a hard gate at inference. Furthermore, a small re-encoder preserves temporal order using absolute time information, enabling second-level localization while maintaining global coverage.
  Integrated into Qwen2.5-VL, QTSplus compresses the vision stream by up to \textbf{89\%} and reduces end-to-end latency by \textbf{28\%} on long videos. The evaluation on eight long video understanding benchmarks shows near-parity accuracy overall when compared with the original Qwen models and outperforms the original model by \textbf{+20.5} and \textbf{+5.6} points respectively on TempCompass direction and order accuracies. These results show that QTSplus is an effective, general mechanism for scaling MLLMs to real-world long-video scenarios while preserving task-relevant evidence.
  We will make all code, data, and trained models' weights publicly available.

TL;DR: 首次使用事件相机进行图像去雾，通过事件引导的扩散模型将事件数据的高动态范围信息传输到RGB图像中，在严重雾霾条件下实现清晰成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RGB的去雾方法受限于有限的动态范围，容易丢失结构和光照细节。事件相机具有更高的动态范围和微秒级延迟，更适合雾霾场景，但缺乏真实配对数据使得HDR信息传输困难。

Method: 提出事件引导的扩散模型，设计事件引导模块将稀疏的HDR事件特征映射到扩散潜在空间，在生成过程中提供精确的结构指导。

Result: 在两个基准测试和自收集的无人机数据集上取得了最先进的结果，特别是在严重雾霾条件下（AQI=341）。

Conclusion: 事件相机结合扩散模型为图像去雾提供了新的解决方案，能够有效传输HDR信息，提高视觉真实感并减少语义漂移。

Abstract: Clear imaging under hazy conditions is a critical task. Prior-based and neural methods have improved results. However, they operate on RGB frames, which suffer from limited dynamic range. Therefore, dehazing remains ill-posed and can erase structure and illumination details. To address this, we use event cameras for dehazing for the \textbf{first time}. Event cameras offer much higher HDR ($120 dBvs.60 dB$) and microsecond latency, therefore they suit hazy scenes. In practice, transferring HDR cues from events to frames is hard because real paired data are scarce. To tackle this, we propose an event-guided diffusion model that utilizes the strong generative priors of diffusion models to reconstruct clear images from hazy inputs by effectively transferring HDR information from events. Specifically, we design an event-guided module that maps sparse HDR event features, \textit{e.g.,} edges, corners, into the diffusion latent space. This clear conditioning provides precise structural guidance during generation, improves visual realism, and reduces semantic drift. For real-world evaluation, we collect a drone dataset in heavy haze (AQI = 341) with synchronized RGB and event sensors. Experiments on two benchmarks and our dataset achieve state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了在数据受限的临床环境下，视觉语言模型在细粒度肾小球亚型分类中的表现，发现病理学专业化的视觉语言骨干网络结合标准微调是最有效的起点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾活检中细粒度肾小球亚型分类至关重要，但临床上有价值的标签稀缺且难以获取。现有计算方法倾向于在全监督下评估粗粒度疾病分类，不清楚视觉语言模型如何在数据约束下适应临床有意义的亚型分类。

Method: 将细粒度肾小球亚型分类建模为临床现实的少样本问题，系统评估病理学专业化和通用视觉语言模型，分析分类性能（准确率、AUC、F1）和学习表示的几何结构，检查图像与文本嵌入的特征对齐和肾小球亚型的可分离性。

Result: 即使每个肾小球亚型只有4-8个标记样本，病理学专业化视觉语言骨干网络也能开始捕捉区分特征，在判别性和校准性方面显示出显著提升，尽管额外监督仍能带来增量改进。正负样本之间的判别与图像-文本对齐同等重要。

Conclusion: 监督水平和适应策略共同塑造诊断性能和多模态结构，为模型选择、适应策略和标注投入提供指导。

Abstract: Fine-grained glomerular subtyping is central to kidney biopsy interpretation, but clinically valuable labels are scarce and difficult to obtain. Existing computational pathology approaches instead tend to evaluate coarse diseased classification under full supervision with image-only models, so it remains unclear how vision-language models (VLMs) should be adapted for clinically meaningful subtyping under data constraints. In this work, we model fine-grained glomerular subtyping as a clinically realistic few-shot problem and systematically evaluate both pathology-specialized and general-purpose vision-language models under this setting. We assess not only classification performance (accuracy, AUC, F1) but also the geometry of the learned representations, examining feature alignment between image and text embeddings and the separability of glomerular subtypes. By jointly analyzing shot count, model architecture and domain knowledge, and adaptation strategy, this study provides guidance for future model selection and training under real clinical data constraints. Our results indicate that pathology-specialized vision-language backbones, when paired with the vanilla fine-tuning, are the most effective starting point. Even with only 4-8 labeled examples per glomeruli subtype, these models begin to capture distinctions and show substantial gains in discrimination and calibration, though additional supervision continues to yield incremental improvements. We also find that the discrimination between positive and negative examples is as important as image-text alignment. Overall, our results show that supervision level and adaptation strategy jointly shape both diagnostic performance and multimodal structure, providing guidance for model selection, adaptation strategies, and annotation investment.

Abstract: Identity-Preserving Personalized Generation (IPPG) has advanced film production and artistic creation, yet existing approaches overemphasize facial regions, resulting in outputs dominated by facial close-ups.These methods suffer from weak visual narrativity and poor semantic consistency under complex text prompts, with the core limitation rooted in identity (ID) feature embeddings undermining the semantic expressiveness of generative models. To address these issues, this paper presents an IPPG method that breaks the constraint of facial close-ups, achieving synergistic optimization of identity fidelity and scene semantic creation. Specifically, we design a Dual-Line Inference (DLI) pipeline with identity-semantic separation, resolving the representation conflict between ID and semantics inherent in traditional single-path architectures. Further, we propose an Identity Adaptive Fusion (IdAF) strategy that defers ID-semantic fusion to the noise prediction stage, integrating adaptive attention fusion and noise decision masking to avoid ID embedding interference on semantics without manual masking. Finally, an Identity Aggregation Prepending (IdAP) module is introduced to aggregate ID information and replace random initializations, further enhancing identity preservation. Experimental results validate that our method achieves stable and effective performance in IPPG tasks beyond facial close-ups, enabling efficient generation without manual masking or fine-tuning. As a plug-and-play component, it can be rapidly deployed in existing IPPG frameworks, addressing the over-reliance on facial close-ups, facilitating film-level character-scene creation, and providing richer personalized generation capabilities for related domains.

*Jiaming Liang,Chi-Man Pun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态参数优化方法(DPO)，解决了传统变换攻击中参数优化的盲点问题，显著提高了对抗样本的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的变换攻击存在三个主要问题：(1)仅考虑低迭代设置，无法反映高迭代下的真实性能；(2)对不同代理模型、迭代次数和任务使用统一参数；(3)传统网格搜索复杂度高，限制了参数优化。

Method: 首先通过实证研究揭示了变换参数强度与可迁移性之间的三种动态模式，提出了同心衰减模型(CDM)来解释这些模式。基于上升后下降模式，设计了高效的动态参数优化(DPO)方法。

Result: 在不同代理模型、迭代次数和任务上的综合实验表明，DPO方法能够显著提高变换攻击的可迁移性，同时将优化复杂度从O(mn)降低到O(nlogm)。

Conclusion: 提出的动态参数优化方法有效解决了变换攻击中的参数优化问题，为提升对抗样本的可迁移性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their wide application, the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks raise societal concerns. Among them, transformation-based attacks have demonstrated notable success in transfer attacks. However, existing attacks suffer from blind spots in parameter optimization, limiting their full potential. Specifically, (1) prior work generally considers low-iteration settings, yet attacks perform quite differently at higher iterations, so characterizing overall performance based only on low-iteration results is misleading. (2) Existing attacks use uniform parameters for different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks, which greatly impairs transferability. (3) Traditional transformation parameter optimization relies on grid search. For n parameters with m steps each, the complexity is O(mn). Large computational overhead limits further optimization of parameters. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study with various transformations as baselines, revealing three dynamic patterns of transferability with respect to parameter strength. We further propose a novel Concentric Decay Model (CDM) to effectively explain these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose an efficient Dynamic Parameter Optimization (DPO) based on the rise-then-fall pattern, reducing the complexity to O(nlogm). Comprehensive experiments on existing transformation-based attacks across different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks demonstrate that our DPO can significantly improve transferability.

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用提供了有前景的解决方案，能够实现精确的工艺控制和半导体制造良率提升

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and measurement of lithography scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are crucial for ensuring precise process control, optimizing device performance, and advancing semiconductor manufacturing yield. Lithography segmentation requires pixel-level delineation of groove contours and consistent performance across diverse pattern geometries and process window. However, existing methods often lack the necessary precision and robustness, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we propose LithoSeg, a coarse-to-fine network tailored for lithography segmentation. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Human-in-the-Loop Bootstrapping scheme for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to attain robustness with minimal supervision. In the subsequent fine stage, we recast 2D segmentation as 1D regression problem by sampling groove-normal profiles using the coarse mask and performing point-wise refinement with a lightweight MLP. LithoSeg outperforms previous approaches in both segmentation accuracy and metrology precision while requiring less supervision, offering promising prospects for real-world applications.

Motivation: 深度学习在显微镜应用中面临模型在新仪器或采集设置下失效的问题，传统对抗域适应方法会破坏已学习的语义表示。

Method: 仅适应最早期的卷积层并冻结深层，结合浅层对抗对齐和预测不确定性来自动选择适应深度，无需目标标签。

Conclusion: 为显微镜领域的无标签自适应提供了设计规则和现场应用方案，代码已公开。

Abstract: Deep learning is transforming microscopy, yet models often fail when applied to images from new instruments or acquisition settings. Conventional adversarial domain adaptation (ADDA) retrains entire networks, often disrupting learned semantic representations. Here, we overturn this paradigm by showing that adapting only the earliest convolutional layers, while freezing deeper layers, yields reliable transfer. Building on this principle, we introduce Subnetwork Image Translation ADDA with automatic depth selection (SIT-ADDA-Auto), a self-configuring framework that integrates shallow-layer adversarial alignment with predictive uncertainty to automatically select adaptation depth without target labels. We demonstrate robustness via multi-metric evaluation, blinded expert assessment, and uncertainty-depth ablations. Across exposure and illumination shifts, cross-instrument transfer, and multiple stains, SIT-ADDA improves reconstruction and downstream segmentation over full-encoder adaptation and non-adversarial baselines, with reduced drift of semantic features. Our results provide a design rule for label-free adaptation in microscopy and a recipe for field settings; the code is publicly available.

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis at signalized intersections is vital for reducing vehicle and pedestrian collisions, yet traditional crash-based studies are limited by data sparsity and latency. This paper presents a novel multi-camera computer vision framework for real-time safety assessment through Post-Encroachment Time (PET) computation, demonstrated at the intersection of H Street and Broadway in Chula Vista, California. Four synchronized cameras provide continuous visual coverage, with each frame processed on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier devices using YOLOv11 segmentation for vehicle detection. Detected vehicle polygons are transformed into a unified bird's-eye map using homography matrices, enabling alignment across overlapping camera views. A novel pixel-level PET algorithm measures vehicle position without reliance on fixed cells, allowing fine-grained hazard visualization via dynamic heatmaps, accurate to 3.3 sq-cm. Timestamped vehicle and PET data is stored in an SQL database for long-term monitoring. Results over various time intervals demonstrate the framework's ability to identify high-risk regions with sub-second precision and real-time throughput on edge devices, producing data for an 800 x 800 pixel logarithmic heatmap at an average of 2.68 FPS. This study validates the feasibility of decentralized vision-based PET analysis for intelligent transportation systems, offering a replicable methodology for high-resolution, real-time, and scalable intersection safety evaluation.

Conclusion: LIHE成功解决了弱监督广义指代表达理解任务，通过混合相似度方法有效防止语义坍塌，为处理可变数量目标的表达理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Weakly-Supervised Referring Expression Comprehension (WREC) methods, while effective, are fundamentally limited by a one-to-one mapping assumption, hindering their ability to handle expressions corresponding to zero or multiple targets in realistic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Weakly-Supervised Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension task (WGREC), a more practical paradigm that handles expressions with variable numbers of referents. However, extending WREC to WGREC presents two fundamental challenges: supervisory signal ambiguity, where weak image-level supervision is insufficient for training a model to infer the correct number and identity of referents, and semantic representation collapse, where standard Euclidean similarity forces hierarchically-related concepts into non-discriminative clusters, blurring categorical boundaries. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel WGREC framework named Linguistic Instance-Split Hyperbolic-Euclidean (LIHE), which operates in two stages. The first stage, Referential Decoupling, predicts the number of target objects and decomposes the complex expression into simpler sub-expressions. The second stage, Referent Grounding, then localizes these sub-expressions using HEMix, our innovative hybrid similarity module that synergistically combines the precise alignment capabilities of Euclidean proximity with the hierarchical modeling strengths of hyperbolic geometry. This hybrid approach effectively prevents semantic collapse while preserving fine-grained distinctions between related concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate LIHE establishes the first effective weakly supervised WGREC baseline on gRefCOCO and Ref-ZOM, while HEMix achieves consistent improvements on standard REC benchmarks, improving IoU@0.5 by up to 2.5\%.

TL;DR: 提出NSDD方法，通过蒸馏迭代DDNM+求解器的零空间组件，实现无需配对监督的快速、逼真无透镜成像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无透镜相机重建方法依赖配对监督会导致域不匹配偏差，而通用扩散先验在噪声、高度复用和病态的无透镜去卷积设置中不稳定。

Method: 分离范围空间强制和零空间扩散先验更新，引入零空间扩散蒸馏(NSDD)：单次学生模型蒸馏迭代DDNM+求解器的零空间组件，以无透镜测量和范围空间锚点为条件。

Result: 在Lensless-FFHQ和PhlatCam上，NSDD是第二快的方法，接近教师模型的感知质量（第二佳LPIPS，优于DPS和经典凸基线方法）。

Conclusion: NSDD为快速、无需真实值、逼真的无透镜成像提供了一条实用路径，保持测量一致性并以少量运行时和内存实现逼真结果。

Abstract: State-of-the-art photorealistic reconstructions for lensless cameras often rely on paired lensless-lensed supervision, which can bias models due to lens-lensless domain mismatch. To avoid this, ground-truth-free diffusion priors are attractive; however, generic formulations tuned for conventional inverse problems often break under the noisy, highly multiplexed, and ill-posed lensless deconvolution setting. We observe that methods which separate range-space enforcement from null-space diffusion-prior updates yield stable, realistic reconstructions. Building on this, we introduce Null-Space Diffusion Distillation (NSDD): a single-pass student that distills the null-space component of an iterative DDNM+ solver, conditioned on the lensless measurement and on a range-space anchor. NSDD preserves measurement consistency and achieves photorealistic results without paired supervision at a fraction of the runtime and memory. On Lensless-FFHQ and PhlatCam, NSDD is the second fastest, behind Wiener, and achieves near-teacher perceptual quality (second-best LPIPS, below DDNM+), outperforming DPS and classical convex baselines. These results suggest a practical path toward fast, ground-truth-free, photorealistic lensless imaging.

Abstract: Accurate point tracking in surgical environments remains challenging due to complex visual conditions, including smoke occlusion, specular reflections, and tissue deformation. While existing surgical tracking datasets provide coordinate information, they lack the semantic context necessary to understand tracking failure mechanisms. We introduce VL-SurgPT, the first large-scale multimodal dataset that bridges visual tracking with textual descriptions of point status in surgical scenes. The dataset comprises 908 in vivo video clips, including 754 for tissue tracking (17,171 annotated points across five challenging scenarios) and 154 for instrument tracking (covering seven instrument types with detailed keypoint annotations). We establish comprehensive benchmarks using eight state-of-the-art tracking methods and propose TG-SurgPT, a text-guided tracking approach that leverages semantic descriptions to improve robustness in visually challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating point status information significantly improves tracking accuracy and reliability, particularly in adverse visual scenarios where conventional vision-only methods struggle. By bridging visual and linguistic modalities, VL-SurgPT enables the development of context-aware tracking systems crucial for advancing computer-assisted surgery applications that can maintain performance even under challenging intraoperative conditions.

Abstract: Long-video understanding remains a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to inherent token limitations and the complexity of capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Existing methods often fail to capture the global context and complex event relationships necessary for deep video reasoning. To address this, we introduce GCAgent, a novel Global-Context-Aware Agent framework that achieves comprehensive long-video understanding. Our core innovation is the Schematic and Narrative Episodic Memory. This memory structurally models events and their causal and temporal relations into a concise, organized context, fundamentally resolving the long-term dependency problem. Operating in a multi-stage Perception-Action-Reflection cycle, our GCAgent utilizes a Memory Manager to retrieve relevant episodic context for robust, context-aware inference. Extensive experiments confirm that GCAgent significantly enhances long-video understanding, achieving up to 23.5\% accuracy improvement on the Video-MME Long split over a strong MLLM baseline. Furthermore, our framework establishes state-of-the-art performance among comparable 7B-scale MLLMs, achieving 73.4\% accuracy on the Long split and the highest overall average (71.9\%) on the Video-MME benchmark, validating our agent-based reasoning paradigm and structured memory for cognitively-inspired long-video understanding.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D poses of hands and objects from a single RGB image is a fundamental yet challenging problem, with broad applications in augmented reality and human-computer interaction. Existing methods largely rely on visual cues alone, often producing results that violate physical constraints such as interpenetration or non-contact. Recent efforts to incorporate physics reasoning typically depend on post-optimization or non-differentiable physics engines, which compromise visual consistency and end-to-end trainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that jointly integrates visual and physical cues for hand-object pose estimation. This integration is achieved through two key ideas: 1) joint visual-physical cue learning: The model is trained to extract 2D visual cues and 3D physical cues, thereby enabling more comprehensive representation learning for hand-object interactions; 2) candidate pose aggregation: A novel refinement process that aggregates multiple diffusion-generated candidate poses by leveraging both visual and physical predictions, yielding a final estimate that is visually consistent and physically plausible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in both pose accuracy and physical plausibility.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在ImageNet上的类条件图像生成任务中优于现有的掩码图像生成方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入先验知识图，KA-MIG有效增强了模型捕捉语义依赖关系的能力，从而提高了生成质量。

Abstract: Masked image generation (MIG) has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and high-fidelity images by enabling parallel token prediction. Existing methods typically rely solely on the model itself to learn semantic dependencies among visual token sequences. However, directly learning such semantic dependencies from data is challenging because the individual tokens lack clear semantic meanings, and these sequences are usually long. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Knowledge-Augmented Masked Image Generation framework, named KA-MIG, which introduces explicit knowledge of token-level semantic dependencies (\emph{i.e.}, extracted from the training data) as priors to learn richer representations for improving performance. In particular, we explore and identify three types of advantageous token knowledge graphs, including two positive and one negative graphs (\emph{i.e.}, the co-occurrence graph, the semantic similarity graph, and the position-token incompatibility graph). Based on three prior knowledge graphs, we design a graph-aware encoder to learn token and position-aware representations. After that, a lightweight fusion mechanism is introduced to integrate these enriched representations into the existing MIG methods. Resorting to such prior knowledge, our method effectively enhances the model's ability to capture semantic dependencies, leading to improved generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves upon existing MIG for class-conditional image generation on ImageNet.

Conclusion: CalMRL有效解决了模态缺失带来的对齐问题，为多模态表示学习提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning harmonizes distinct modalities by aligning them into a unified latent space. Recent research generalizes traditional cross-modal alignment to produce enhanced multimodal synergy but requires all modalities to be present for a common instance, making it challenging to utilize prevalent datasets with missing modalities. We provide theoretical insights into this issue from an anchor shift perspective. Observed modalities are aligned with a local anchor that deviates from the optimal one when all modalities are present, resulting in an inevitable shift. To address this, we propose CalMRL for multimodal representation learning to calibrate incomplete alignments caused by missing modalities. Specifically, CalMRL leverages the priors and the inherent connections among modalities to model the imputation for the missing ones at the representation level. To resolve the optimization dilemma, we employ a bi-step learning method with the closed-form solution of the posterior distribution of shared latents. We validate its mitigation of anchor shift and convergence with theoretical guidance. By equipping the calibrated alignment with the existing advanced method, we offer new flexibility to absorb data with missing modalities, which is originally unattainable. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate the superiority of CalMRL. Our code, model checkpoints, and evaluation raw data will be publicly available.

Conclusion: SRSplat通过有效结合外部参考信息和内部纹理线索，成功解决了从稀疏低分辨率图像重建高分辨率3D场景的纹理细节恢复问题。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction from sparse, low-resolution (LR) images is a crucial capability for real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and embodied AI. However, existing methods often fail to recover fine texture details. This limitation stems from the inherent lack of high-frequency information in LR inputs. To address this, we propose \textbf{SRSplat}, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs high-resolution 3D scenes from only a few LR views. Our main insight is to compensate for the deficiency of texture information by jointly leveraging external high-quality reference images and internal texture cues. We first construct a scene-specific reference gallery, generated for each scene using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and diffusion models. To integrate this external information, we introduce the \textit{Reference-Guided Feature Enhancement (RGFE)} module, which aligns and fuses features from the LR input images and their reference twin image. Subsequently, we train a decoder to predict the Gaussian primitives using the multi-view fused feature obtained from \textit{RGFE}. To further refine predicted Gaussian primitives, we introduce \textit{Texture-Aware Density Control (TADC)}, which adaptively adjusts Gaussian density based on the internal texture richness of the LR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SRSplat outperforms existing methods on various datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU, and exhibits strong cross-dataset and cross-resolution generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FedSDA方法，通过扩散模型和染色分离技术调整客户端数据分布，解决联邦学习中组织病理图像的非IID数据分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中非IID数据分布偏移是不可避免的挑战，特别是在组织病理图像领域，这阻碍了FL的应用。

Method: 基于扩散模型拟合数据分布，利用染色分离提取关键特征，将每个客户端的染色分布与目标分布对齐，同时避免隐私泄露风险。

Result: 实验结果表明FedSDA能有效提升基线方法性能，在缓解客户端间分布偏移方面优于其他从数据分布角度处理非IID问题的方法。

Conclusion: FedSDA为计算病理学社区提供了有价值的实用见解，能有效解决联邦学习中的非IID数据分布问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has shown success in collaboratively training a model among decentralized data resources without directly sharing privacy-sensitive training data. Despite recent advances, non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data poses an inevitable challenge that hinders the use of FL. In this work, we address the issue of non-IID histopathological images with feature distribution shifts from an intuitive perspective that has only received limited attention. Specifically, we address this issue from the perspective of data distribution by solely adjusting the data distributions of all clients. Building on the success of diffusion models in fitting data distributions and leveraging stain separation to extract the pivotal features that are closely related to the non-IID properties of histopathological images, we propose a Federated Stain Distribution Alignment (FedSDA) method. FedSDA aligns the stain distribution of each client with a target distribution in an FL framework to mitigate distribution shifts among clients. Furthermore, considering that training diffusion models on raw data in FL has been shown to be susceptible to privacy leakage risks, we circumvent this problem while still effectively achieving alignment. Extensive experimental results show that FedSDA is not only effective in improving baselines that focus on mitigating disparities across clients' model updates but also outperforms baselines that address the non-IID data issues from the perspective of data distribution. We show that FedSDA provides valuable and practical insights for the computational pathology community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像存在潜在解剖分组（如器官、组织和病理区域），但标准ViT无法利用这些结构。现有方法如SBM-Transformer存在不可微分性、训练不稳定和无法建模复杂社区结构的问题。

Method: 提出DCMM-Transformer，将度校正混合成员模型作为自注意力中的加性偏置引入，以完全可微分和可解释的方式建模社区结构和度异质性，避免了乘性掩码和二元采样。

Result: 在脑部、胸部、乳腺和眼部等多种医学成像数据集上的综合实验表明，该方法具有优越的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 学习到的组结构和结构化注意力调制显著增强了可解释性，产生了解剖学意义和语义连贯的注意力图。

Abstract: Medical images exhibit latent anatomical groupings, such as organs, tissues, and pathological regions, that standard Vision Transformers (ViTs) fail to exploit. While recent work like SBM-Transformer attempts to incorporate such structures through stochastic binary masking, they suffer from non-differentiability, training instability, and the inability to model complex community structure. We present DCMM-Transformer, a novel ViT architecture for medical image analysis that incorporates a Degree-Corrected Mixed-Membership (DCMM) model as an additive bias in self-attention. Unlike prior approaches that rely on multiplicative masking and binary sampling, our method introduces community structure and degree heterogeneity in a fully differentiable and interpretable manner. Comprehensive experiments across diverse medical imaging datasets, including brain, chest, breast, and ocular modalities, demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the learned group structure and structured attention modulation substantially enhance interpretability by yielding attention maps that are anatomically meaningful and semantically coherent.

Conclusion: UniABG框架有效解决了无监督跨视角地理定位中的伪标签噪声问题，实现了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) matches query images ($\textit{e.g.}$, drone) to geographically corresponding opposite-view imagery ($\textit{e.g.}$, satellite). While supervised methods achieve strong performance, their reliance on extensive pairwise annotations limits scalability. Unsupervised alternatives avoid annotation costs but suffer from noisy pseudo-labels due to intrinsic cross-view domain gaps. To address these limitations, we propose $\textit{UniABG}$, a novel dual-stage unsupervised cross-view geo-localization framework integrating adversarial view bridging with graph-based correspondence calibration. Our approach first employs View-Aware Adversarial Bridging (VAAB) to model view-invariant features and enhance pseudo-label robustness. Subsequently, Heterogeneous Graph Filtering Calibration (HGFC) refines cross-view associations by constructing dual inter-view structure graphs, achieving reliable view correspondence. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art unsupervised performance, showing that UniABG improves Satellite $\rightarrow$ Drone AP by +10.63\% on University-1652 and +16.73\% on SUES-200, even surpassing supervised baselines.

Conclusion: PipeDiT框架通过创新的流水线设计有效解决了DiT模型在实际部署中的性能瓶颈，为视频生成的实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation has been advancing rapidly, and diffusion transformer (DiT) based models have demonstrated remark- able capabilities. However, their practical deployment is of- ten hindered by slow inference speeds and high memory con- sumption. In this paper, we propose a novel pipelining frame- work named PipeDiT to accelerate video generation, which is equipped with three main innovations. First, we design a pipelining algorithm (PipeSP) for sequence parallelism (SP) to enable the computation of latent generation and commu- nication among multiple GPUs to be pipelined, thus reduc- ing inference latency. Second, we propose DeDiVAE to de- couple the diffusion module and the variational autoencoder (VAE) module into two GPU groups, whose executions can also be pipelined to reduce memory consumption and infer- ence latency. Third, to better utilize the GPU resources in the VAE group, we propose an attention co-processing (Aco) method to further reduce the overall video generation latency. We integrate our PipeDiT into both OpenSoraPlan and Hun- yuanVideo, two state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks, and conduct extensive experiments on two 8- GPU systems. Experimental results show that, under many common resolution and timestep configurations, our PipeDiT achieves 1.06x to 4.02x speedups over OpenSoraPlan and HunyuanVideo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法存在三个关键局限：轨迹语义和层次建模不足、点级编码计算成本高、使用物理不合理的增强方法扭曲轨迹语义。

Method: 将原始GPS轨迹转换为运动语义特征并分割为补丁，使用内外补丁注意力编码局部和全局轨迹模式，采用曲率引导的增强策略保留信息段并屏蔽冗余段。

Result: 在真实数据集上优于现有方法，相似性搜索任务的平均排名接近理想值1，启发式近似改进达20.3%，推理延迟降低达43.4%。

Conclusion: MovSemCL通过运动语义对比学习有效解决了轨迹相似性计算的关键问题，在性能和效率方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Trajectory similarity computation is fundamental functionality that is used for, e.g., clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection. However, existing learning-based methods exhibit three key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of trajectory semantics and hierarchy, lacking both movement dynamics extraction and multi-scale structural representation; (2) high computational costs due to point-wise encoding; and (3) use of physically implausible augmentations that distort trajectory semantics. To address these issues, we propose MovSemCL, a movement-semantics contrastive learning framework for trajectory similarity computation. MovSemCL first transforms raw GPS trajectories into movement-semantics features and then segments them into patches. Next, MovSemCL employs intra- and inter-patch attentions to encode local as well as global trajectory patterns, enabling efficient hierarchical representation and reducing computational costs. Moreover, MovSemCL includes a curvature-guided augmentation strategy that preserves informative segments (e.g., turns and intersections) and masks redundant ones, generating physically plausible augmented views. Experiments on real-world datasets show that MovSemCL is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving mean ranks close to the ideal value of 1 at similarity search tasks and improvements by up to 20.3% at heuristic approximation, while reducing inference latency by up to 43.4%.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在紫边去除方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DCA-LUT框架通过数据驱动方法有效解决了紫边问题，无需依赖昂贵的硬件解决方案。

Abstract: Purple fringing, a persistent artifact caused by Longitudinal Chromatic Aberration (LCA) in camera lenses, has long degraded the clarity and realism of digital imaging. Traditional solutions rely on complex and expensive apochromatic (APO) lens hardware and the extraction of handcrafted features, ignoring the data-driven approach. To fill this gap, we introduce DCA-LUT, the first deep learning framework for purple fringing removal. Inspired by the physical root of the problem, the spatial misalignment of RGB color channels due to lens dispersion, we introduce a novel Chromatic-Aware Coordinate Transformation (CA-CT) module, learning an image-adaptive color space to decouple and isolate fringing into a dedicated dimension. This targeted separation allows the network to learn a precise ``purple fringe channel", which then guides the accurate restoration of the luminance channel. The final color correction is performed by a learned 5D Look-Up Table (5D LUT), enabling efficient and powerful% non-linear color mapping. To enable robust training and fair evaluation, we constructed a large-scale synthetic purple fringing dataset (PF-Synth). Extensive experiments in synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in purple fringing removal.

Abstract: Emotion understanding is critical for making Large Language Models (LLMs) more general, reliable, and aligned with humans. Art conveys emotion through the joint design of visual and auditory elements, yet most prior work is human-centered or single-modality, overlooking the emotion intentionally expressed by the artwork. Meanwhile, current Audio-Visual Language Models (AVLMs) typically require large-scale audio pretraining to endow Visual Language Models (VLMs) with hearing, which limits scalability. We present Vision Anchored Audio-Visual Emotion LLM (VAEmotionLLM), a two-stage framework that teaches a VLM to hear by seeing with limited audio pretraining and to understand emotion across modalities. In Stage 1, Vision-Guided Audio Alignment (VG-Align) distills the frozen visual pathway into a new audio pathway by aligning next-token distributions of the shared LLM on synchronized audio-video clips, enabling hearing without a large audio dataset. In Stage 2, a lightweight Cross-Modal Emotion Adapter (EmoAdapter), composed of the Emotion Enhancer and the Emotion Supervisor, injects emotion-sensitive residuals and applies emotion supervision to enhance cross-modal emotion understanding. We also construct ArtEmoBenchmark, an art-centric emotion benchmark that evaluates content and emotion understanding under audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual inputs. VAEmotionLLM achieves state-of-the-art results on ArtEmoBenchmark, outperforming audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual baselines. Ablations show that the proposed components are complementary.

Abstract: Vector quantization has emerged as a powerful tool in large-scale multimodal models, unifying heterogeneous representations through discrete token encoding. However, its effectiveness hinges on robust codebook design. Current prototype-based approaches relying on trainable vectors or clustered centroids fall short in representativeness and interpretability, even as multimodal alignment demonstrates its promise in vision-language models. To address these limitations, we propose a simple multimodal prompting-driven quantization framework for point cloud analysis. Our methodology is built upon two core insights: 1) Text embeddings from pre-trained models inherently encode visual semantics through many-to-one contrastive alignment, naturally serving as robust prototype priors; and 2) Multimodal prompts enable adaptive refinement of these prototypes, effectively mitigating vision-language semantic gaps. The framework introduces a dual-constrained quantization space, enforced by compactness and separation regularization, which seamlessly integrates visual and prototype features, resulting in hybrid representations that jointly encode geometric and semantic information. Furthermore, we employ Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to achieve differentiable discretization while maintaining quantization sparsity. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets clearly demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods fine-tune only a small set of additional learnable parameters while keeping the pre-trained model's parameters frozen. It enables efficient adaptation to new tasks while mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. These methods typically attach one independent task-specific prompt to each layer of pre-trained models to locally modulate its features, ensuring that the layer's representation aligns with the requirements of the new task. However, although introducing learnable prompts independently at each layer provides high flexibility for adapting to new tasks, this overly flexible tuning could make certain layers susceptible to unnecessary updates. As all prompts till the current task are added together as a final prompt for all seen tasks, the model may easily overwrite feature representations essential to previous tasks, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical layer-grouped prompt tuning method for continual learning. It improves model stability in two ways: (i) Layers in the same group share roughly the same prompts, which are adjusted by position encoding. This helps preserve the intrinsic feature relationships and propagation pathways of the pre-trained model within each group. (ii) It utilizes a single task-specific root prompt to learn to generate sub-prompts for each layer group. In this way, all sub-prompts are conditioned on the same root prompt, enhancing their synergy and reducing independence. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves favorable performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: PACE是首个针对SNN和事件视觉的数据集蒸馏框架，通过ST-DSM和PEQ-N模块将大型训练数据集压缩成紧凑的合成数据集，实现快速SNN训练，在多个数据集上显著减少训练时间和存储成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机与SNN在生物启发动力学上天然匹配，但SNN由于时间编码导致训练成本高昂，限制了实际部署。需要降低SNN的训练成本以促进其应用。

Method: 提出PACE框架，包含两个核心模块：ST-DSM使用残差膜电位来稠化基于尖峰的特征，并进行细粒度的时空幅度和相位匹配；PEQ-N提供即插即用的直通概率整数量化器，兼容标准事件帧流水线。

Conclusion: PACE能够生成紧凑的替代数据集，实现分钟级的SNN训练和高效的边缘部署，为事件视觉和SNN的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras sense brightness changes and output binary asynchronous event streams, attracting increasing attention. Their bio-inspired dynamics align well with spiking neural networks (SNNs), offering a promising energy-efficient alternative to conventional vision systems. However, SNNs remain costly to train due to temporal coding, which limits their practical deployment. To alleviate the high training cost of SNNs, we introduce \textbf{PACE} (Phase-Aligned Condensation for Events), the first dataset distillation framework to SNNs and event-based vision. PACE distills a large training dataset into a compact synthetic one that enables fast SNN training, which is achieved by two core modules: \textbf{ST-DSM} and \textbf{PEQ-N}. ST-DSM uses residual membrane potentials to densify spike-based features (SDR) and to perform fine-grained spatiotemporal matching of amplitude and phase (ST-SM), while PEQ-N provides a plug-and-play straight through probabilistic integer quantizer compatible with standard event-frame pipelines. Across DVS-Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-MNIST datasets, PACE outperforms existing coreset selection and dataset distillation baselines, with particularly strong gains on dynamic event streams and at low or moderate IPC. Specifically, on N-MNIST, it achieves \(84.4\%\) accuracy, about \(85\%\) of the full training set performance, while reducing training time by more than \(50\times\) and storage cost by \(6000\times\), yielding compact surrogates that enable minute-scale SNN training and efficient edge deployment.

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient intelligence via event-driven, sparse computation, but deeper architectures inflate parameters and computational cost, hindering their edge deployment. Recent progress in SNN pruning helps alleviate this burden, yet existing efforts fall into only two families: \emph{unstructured} pruning, which attains high sparsity but is difficult to accelerate on general hardware, and \emph{structured} pruning, which eases deployment but lack flexibility and often degrades accuracy at matched sparsity. In this work, we introduce \textbf{SpikeNM}, the first SNN-oriented \emph{semi-structured} \(N{:}M\) pruning framework that learns sparse SNNs \emph{from scratch}, enforcing \emph{at most \(N\)} non-zeros per \(M\)-weight block. To avoid the combinatorial space complexity \(\sum_{k=1}^{N}\binom{M}{k}\) growing exponentially with \(M\), SpikeNM adopts an \(M\)-way basis-logit parameterization with a differentiable top-\(k\) sampler, \emph{linearizing} per-block complexity to \(\mathcal O(M)\) and enabling more aggressive sparsification. Further inspired by neuroscience, we propose \emph{eligibility-inspired distillation} (EID), which converts temporally accumulated credits into block-wise soft targets to align mask probabilities with spiking dynamics, reducing sampling variance and stabilizing search under high sparsity. Experiments show that at \(2{:}4\) sparsity, SpikeNM maintains and even with gains across main-stream datasets, while yielding hardware-amenable patterns that complement intrinsic spike sparsity.

TL;DR: 提出DGCF框架，将冻结的自监督DINOv3 Transformer与可训练的CNN编码器-解码器集成，通过可学习的交叉融合模块分层融合Transformer的全局表示和CNN的局部特征，实现局部外观和上下文表示的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型缺乏全局语义理解，而Transformer由于高模型容量和弱归纳偏置容易在小型医学数据集上过拟合。

Method: 使用冻结的DINOv3 Transformer和可训练CNN编码器-解码器，通过交叉融合模块分层融合全局和局部特征，并引入多级DINOv3感知损失。

Conclusion: 这是首个将DINOv3表示用于医学图像转换的工作，展示了自监督Transformer指导在语义感知CT合成中的潜力。

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT images from CBCT or MRI has a potential for efficient radiation dose planning and adaptive radiotherapy. However, existing CNN-based models lack global semantic understanding, while Transformers often overfit small medical datasets due to high model capacity and weak inductive bias. To address these limitations, we propose a DINOv3-Guided Cross Fusion (DGCF) framework that integrates a frozen self-supervised DINOv3 Transformer with a trainable CNN encoder-decoder. It hierarchically fuses global representation of Transformer and local features of CNN via a learnable cross fusion module, achieving balanced local appearance and contextual representation. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-Level DINOv3 Perceptual (MLDP) loss that encourages semantic similarity between synthetic CT and the ground truth in DINOv3's feature space. Experiments on the SynthRAD2023 pelvic dataset demonstrate that DGCF achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of MS-SSIM, PSNR and segmentation-based metrics on both MRI$\rightarrow$CT and CBCT$\rightarrow$CT translation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ DINOv3 representations for medical image translation, highlighting the potential of self-supervised Transformer guidance for semantic-aware CT synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Begin-of-Video Tokens (ada-BOV)方法，用于改进自回归视频扩散模型，解决长视频生成中的一致性和动态质量问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在生成长视频时存在两种主要范式：基于分块的扩展方法存在去噪延迟和误差累积问题，流式去噪方法则面临一致性脆弱和动态效果差的问题。

Method: 提出自适应BOV令牌，通过类似自适应层归一化的调制机制吸收去噪的前帧；提出流式去噪细化策略，将采样轨迹长度与注意力窗口大小解耦；设计扰动增强训练噪声调度。

Result: 在多个指标上获得了令人信服的定性和定量结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持全局一致性的同时，改善了局部动态质量，为自回归视频扩散模型提供了有效的长视频生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based video generation have produced impressive and high-fidelity short videos. To extend these successes to generate coherent long videos, most video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent frames conditioned on previous ones. There are generally two primary paradigms: chunk-based extension and stream denoising. The former directly concatenates previous clean frames as conditioning, suffering from denoising latency and error accumulation. The latter maintains the denoising sequence with monotonically increasing noise levels. In each denoising iteration, one clean frame is produced while a new pure noise is simultaneously appended, enabling live-stream sampling. However, it struggles with fragile consistency and poor motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Begin-of-Video Tokens (ada-BOV) for autoregressive VDMs. The BOV tokens are special learnable embeddings on VDMs. They adaptively absorb denoised preceding frames via an adaptive-layer-norm-like modulation. This design preserves the global consistency while allowing for flexible conditioning in dynamic scenarios. To ensure the quality of local dynamics essential in modulating BOV tokens, we further propose a refinement strategy for stream denoising. It decouples the sampling trajectory length from the attention window size constraint, leading to improved local guidance and overall imaging quality. We also propose a disturbance-augmented training noise schedule, which balances the convergence speed with model robustness for the stream denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves compelling qualitative and quantitative results across multiple metrics.

TL;DR: 提出SS-CA方法，通过反事实解释增强训练，解决视觉模型依赖有限因果特征的问题，提升泛化能力和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型仅依赖有限的充分因果特征进行预测，导致对分布偏移或关键特征缺失敏感。模型与人类在识别反事实样本时存在差异，表明模型学习到的依赖关系可能不够因果充分

Method: 基于LIMA归因方法开发Counterfactual LIMA，识别最小空间区域集合，其移除能选择性改变模型预测。使用数据增强策略将识别区域替换为自然背景，并在增强和原始样本上联合训练模型

Result: 在多个ImageNet变体上的实验表明，SS-CA改善了ID测试数据的泛化能力，并在OOD基准测试（如ImageNet-R和ImageNet-S）上表现更优。在噪声等扰动下，SS-CA训练的模型也展现出增强的泛化能力

Conclusion: SS-CA方法有效利用可解释性洞察纠正模型缺陷，提高了性能和鲁棒性，证明将反事实解释整合到训练过程可以缓解不完全因果学习问题

Abstract: In current visual model training, models often rely on only limited sufficient causes for their predictions, which makes them sensitive to distribution shifts or the absence of key features. Attribution methods can accurately identify a model's critical regions. However, masking these areas to create counterfactuals often causes the model to misclassify the target, while humans can still easily recognize it. This divergence highlights that the model's learned dependencies may not be sufficiently causal. To address this issue, we propose Subset-Selected Counterfactual Augmentation (SS-CA), which integrates counterfactual explanations directly into the training process for targeted intervention. Building on the subset-selection-based LIMA attribution method, we develop Counterfactual LIMA to identify minimal spatial region sets whose removal can selectively alter model predictions. Leveraging these attributions, we introduce a data augmentation strategy that replaces the identified regions with natural background, and we train the model jointly on both augmented and original samples to mitigate incomplete causal learning. Extensive experiments across multiple ImageNet variants show that SS-CA improves generalization on in-distribution (ID) test data and achieves superior performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks such as ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S. Under perturbations including noise, models trained with SS-CA also exhibit enhanced generalization, demonstrating that our approach effectively uses interpretability insights to correct model deficiencies and improve both performance and robustness.

We pair building footprint and height data from existing datasets with quarterly PlanetScope basemap satellite images to train a multi-task deep learning model that predicts building density and building height at a 37.6-meter per pixel resolution. We apply this model to global PlanetScope basemaps from Q1 2018 through Q2 2025 to create global, temporal maps of building density and height. We validate these maps by comparing against existing building footprint datasets. Our estimates achieve an F1 score between 85% and 88% on different hand-labeled subsets, and are temporally stable, with a 0.96 five-year trend-consistency score. TEMPO captures quarterly changes in built settlements at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable approaches, unlocking large-scale monitoring of development patterns and climate impacts essential for global resilience and adaptation efforts.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfakes poses significant threats to information integrity. While DINOv2 shows promise for detection, existing fine-tuning approaches treat it as generic binary classification, overlooking distinct artifacts inherent to different deepfake methods. To address this, we propose a DeepFake Fine-Grained Adapter (DFF-Adapter) for DINOv2. Our method incorporates lightweight multi-head LoRA modules into every transformer block, enabling efficient backbone adaptation. DFF-Adapter simultaneously addresses authenticity detection and fine-grained manipulation type classification, where classifying forgery methods enhances artifact sensitivity. We introduce a shared branch propagating fine-grained manipulation cues to the authenticity head. This enables multi-task cooperative optimization, explicitly enhancing authenticity discrimination with manipulation-specific knowledge. Utilizing only 3.5M trainable parameters, our parameter-efficient approach achieves detection accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of current complex state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MEMR-Seg任务和MediRound模型为多轮医学推理分割提供了有效解决方案，通过交互式多轮对话实现更精确的实体级分割。

Abstract: Despite the progress in medical image segmentation, most existing methods remain task-specific and lack interactivity. Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.

Conclusion: RadarMP增强了全场景自动驾驶系统的感知能力，为恶劣天气条件下的可靠运动感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene motion perception significantly enhances the safety and reliability of an autonomous driving system. Benefiting from its all-weather operational capability and unique perceptual properties, 4D mmWave radar has emerged as an essential component in advanced autonomous driving. However, sparse and noisy radar points often lead to imprecise motion perception, leaving autonomous vehicles with limited sensing capabilities when optical sensors degrade under adverse weather conditions. In this paper, we propose RadarMP, a novel method for precise 3D scene motion perception using low-level radar echo signals from two consecutive frames. Unlike existing methods that separate radar target detection and motion estimation, RadarMP jointly models both tasks in a unified architecture, enabling consistent radar point cloud generation and pointwise 3D scene flow prediction. Tailored to radar characteristics, we design specialized self-supervised loss functions guided by Doppler shifts and echo intensity, effectively supervising spatial and motion consistency without explicit annotations. Extensive experiments on the public dataset demonstrate that RadarMP achieves reliable motion perception across diverse weather and illumination conditions, outperforming radar-based decoupled motion perception pipelines and enhancing perception capabilities for full-scenario autonomous driving systems.

Result: 实验表明OAD-Promoter显著提升了基于LLM的VQA方法在少样本和零样本设置下的性能，达到了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: OAD-Promoter通过减轻语言偏见和增强领域转移鲁棒性，有效解决了LLM在VQA中的局限性，为处理知识密集型问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a crucial tool in Visual Question Answering (VQA) for handling knowledge-intensive questions in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. However, their reliance on massive training datasets often causes them to inherit language biases during the acquisition of knowledge. This limitation imposes two key constraints on existing methods: (1) LLM predictions become less reliable due to bias exploitation, and (2) despite strong knowledge reasoning capabilities, LLMs still struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To address these issues, we propose Object Attribute Description Promoter (OAD-Promoter), a novel approach for enhancing LLM-based VQA by mitigating language bias and improving domain-shift robustness. OAD-Promoter comprises three components: the Object-concentrated Example Generation (OEG) module, the Memory Knowledge Assistance (MKA) module, and the OAD Prompt. The OEG module generates global captions and object-concentrated samples, jointly enhancing visual information input to the LLM and mitigating bias through complementary global and regional visual cues. The MKA module assists the LLM in handling OOD samples by retrieving relevant knowledge from stored examples to support questions from unseen domains. Finally, the OAD Prompt integrates the outputs of the preceding modules to optimize LLM inference. Experiments demonstrate that OAD-Promoter significantly improves the performance of LLM-based VQA methods in few-shot or zero-shot settings, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 当配备优化的运行时和脉冲驱动的模型压缩时，脉冲神经网络可以在传统嵌入式平台上高效执行。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) communicate via discrete spikes in time rather than continuous activations. Their event-driven nature offers advantages for temporal processing and energy efficiency on resource-constrained hardware, but training and deployment remain challenging. We present a lightweight C-based runtime for SNN inference on edge devices and optimizations that reduce latency and memory without sacrificing accuracy. Trained models exported from SNNTorch are translated to a compact C representation; static, cache-friendly data layouts and preallocation avoid interpreter and allocation overheads. We further exploit sparse spiking activity to prune inactive neurons and synapses, shrinking computation in upstream convolutional layers. Experiments on N-MNIST and ST-MNIST show functional parity with the Python baseline while achieving ~10 speedups on desktop CPU and additional gains with pruning, together with large memory reductions that enable microcontroller deployment (Arduino Portenta H7). Results indicate that SNNs can be executed efficiently on conventional embedded platforms when paired with an optimized runtime and spike-driven model compression.

Abstract: Source attribution aims to enhance the reliability of AI-generated answers by including references for each statement, helping users validate the provided answers. However, existing work has primarily focused on text-only scenario and largely overlooked the role of multimodality. We introduce MAVIS, the first benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal source attribution systems that understand user intent behind visual questions, retrieve multimodal evidence, and generate long-form answers with citations. Our dataset comprises 157K visual QA instances, where each answer is annotated with fact-level citations referring to multimodal documents. We develop fine-grained automatic metrics along three dimensions of informativeness, groundedness, and fluency, and demonstrate their strong correlation with human judgments. Our key findings are threefold: (1) LVLMs with multimodal RAG generate more informative and fluent answers than unimodal RAG, but they exhibit weaker groundedness for image documents than for text documents, a gap amplified in multimodal settings. (2) Given the same multimodal documents, there is a trade-off between informativeness and groundedness across different prompting methods. (3) Our proposed method highlights mitigating contextual bias in interpreting image documents as a crucial direction for future research.

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs) promises energy-efficient visual intelligence, yet scarce event data and the sparsity of DVS outputs hinder effective training. Prior knowledge transfers from RGB to DVS often underperform because the distribution gap between modalities is substantial. In this work, we present Time-step Mixup Knowledge Transfer (TMKT), a cross-modal training framework with a probabilistic Time-step Mixup (TSM) strategy. TSM exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time steps to produce a smooth curriculum within each sequence, which reduces gradient variance and stabilizes optimization with theoretical analysis. To employ auxiliary supervision from TSM, TMKT introduces two lightweight modality-aware objectives, Modality Aware Guidance (MAG) for per-frame source supervision and Mixup Ratio Perception (MRP) for sequence-level mix ratio estimation, which explicitly align temporal features with the mixing schedule. TMKT enables smoother knowledge transfer, helps mitigate modality mismatch during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and multiple SNN backbones, together with ablations, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: FIA-Edit是一个基于频率交互注意力的免反演图像编辑框架，通过频率表示交互和特征注入模块，实现高保真、语义精确的编辑，并在医疗图像数据增强中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于流的免反演方法虽然效率高，但缺乏有效的源信息整合，导致背景保留差、空间不一致和过度编辑问题。

Method: 提出频率交互注意力框架，包含频率表示交互模块（在自注意力中交换源和目标特征的频率分量）和特征注入模块（在交叉注意力中显式注入源侧查询、键、值和文本嵌入）。

Result: 在RTX 4090上每张512*512图像约6秒，在视觉质量、背景保真度和可控性方面优于现有方法，并首次将文本引导图像编辑扩展到临床应用中，显著提升下游出血分类性能。

Conclusion: FIA-Edit实现了高效高保真的图像编辑，为医疗数据增强开辟了新途径，在临床应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has advanced rapidly with the rise of diffusion models. While flow-based inversion-free methods offer high efficiency by avoiding latent inversion, they often fail to effectively integrate source information, leading to poor background preservation, spatial inconsistencies, and over-editing due to the lack of effective integration of source information. In this paper, we present FIA-Edit, a novel inversion-free framework that achieves high-fidelity and semantically precise edits through a Frequency-Interactive Attention. Specifically, we design two key components: (1) a Frequency Representation Interaction (FRI) module that enhances cross-domain alignment by exchanging frequency components between source and target features within self-attention, and (2) a Feature Injection (FIJ) module that explicitly incorporates source-side queries, keys, values, and text embeddings into the target branch's cross-attention to preserve structure and semantics. Comprehensive and extensive experiments demonstrate that FIA-Edit supports high-fidelity editing at low computational cost (~6s per 512 * 512 image on an RTX 4090) and consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse tasks in visual quality, background fidelity, and controllability. Furthermore, we are the first to extend text-guided image editing to clinical applications. By synthesizing anatomically coherent hemorrhage variations in surgical images, FIA-Edit opens new opportunities for medical data augmentation and delivers significant gains in downstream bleeding classification.

TL;DR: 提出CRH框架，通过动态重新分配预设码本中的哈希中心并联合优化哈希函数，避免了传统两阶段方法的复杂性和性能损失，在检索任务中优于现有深度哈希方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于哈希中心的方法存在随机初始化忽视类间语义关系、两阶段方法引入额外复杂性和阶段间不一致的问题，需要一种端到端的解决方案。

Method: CRH框架：1）从预设码本动态重新分配哈希中心；2）联合优化哈希函数；3）使用多头机制增强哈希中心表示能力。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的实验表明，CRH能够学习到语义有意义的哈希中心，并在检索任务中优于最先进的深度哈希方法。

Conclusion: CRH通过端到端动态重新分配哈希中心，有效整合语义关系，避免了传统方法的局限性，实现了更好的检索性能。

Abstract: Hash center-based deep hashing methods improve upon pairwise or triplet-based approaches by assigning fixed hash centers to each class as learning targets, thereby avoiding the inefficiency of local similarity optimization. However, random center initialization often disregards inter-class semantic relationships. While existing two-stage methods mitigate this by first refining hash centers with semantics and then training the hash function, they introduce additional complexity, computational overhead, and suboptimal performance due to stage-wise discrepancies. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{Center-Reassigned Hashing (CRH)}$, an end-to-end framework that $\textbf{dynamically reassigns hash centers}$ from a preset codebook while jointly optimizing the hash function. Unlike previous methods, CRH adapts hash centers to the data distribution $\textbf{without explicit center optimization phases}$, enabling seamless integration of semantic relationships into the learning process. Furthermore, $\textbf{a multi-head mechanism}$ enhances the representational capacity of hash centers, capturing richer semantic structures. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that CRH learns semantically meaningful hash centers and outperforms state-of-the-art deep hashing methods in retrieval tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的点云补全范式Completion-by-Correction，通过预训练图像到3D模型生成拓扑完整的形状先验，然后在特征空间进行校正，相比传统的Completion-by-Inpainting方法能产生更一致的结构和更少的拓扑伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态点云补全方法采用Completion-by-Inpainting范式，从融合的潜在特征中合成缺失结构，但由于几何和语义约束有限，经常导致结构不一致和拓扑伪影。

Method: 提出PGNet多阶段框架：1) 双特征编码以锚定生成先验；2) 合成结构对齐的粗糙支架；3) 通过分层校正逐步细化几何细节。

Result: 在ShapeNetViPC数据集上，PGNet在平均Chamfer Distance上比最先进基线降低23.5%，F-score提高7.1%。

Conclusion: Completion-by-Correction范式将补全任务从无约束合成转变为引导式细化，能够实现结构一致且与观测对齐的重建。

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete 3D shapes from partial observations, which is a challenging problem due to severe occlusions and missing geometry. Despite recent advances in multimodal techniques that leverage complementary RGB images to compensate for missing geometry, most methods still follow a Completion-by-Inpainting paradigm, synthesizing missing structures from fused latent features. We empirically show that this paradigm often results in structural inconsistencies and topological artifacts due to limited geometric and semantic constraints. To address this, we rethink the task and propose a more robust paradigm, termed Completion-by-Correction, which begins with a topologically complete shape prior generated by a pretrained image-to-3D model and performs feature-space correction to align it with the partial observation. This paradigm shifts completion from unconstrained synthesis to guided refinement, enabling structurally consistent and observation-aligned reconstruction. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce PGNet, a multi-stage framework that conducts dual-feature encoding to ground the generative prior, synthesizes a coarse yet structurally aligned scaffold, and progressively refines geometric details via hierarchical correction. Experiments on the ShapeNetViPC dataset demonstrate the superiority of PGNet over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of average Chamfer Distance (-23.5%) and F-score (+7.1%).

*Jinyuan Hu,Jiayou Zhang,Shaobo Cui,Kun Zhang,Guangyi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixAR是一个新颖的自回归图像生成框架，通过离散-连续混合训练范式，利用离散token作为先验指导来改进连续自回归建模，解决了连续表示空间中的建模挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归方法使用离散token表示图像，但量化过程和有限码本大小会丢失细粒度信息，限制了生成保真度。虽然连续潜在空间的自回归建模能提供更高质量，但连续表示存在于广阔无结构空间中，给高效自回归建模带来挑战。

Method: 提出MixAR框架，采用因子化公式，利用离散token作为先验指导进行连续自回归预测。研究了多种离散-连续混合策略：自注意力（DC-SA）、交叉注意力（DC-CA）以及简单的DC-Mix方法（用信息丰富的离散对应物替换同质掩码token）。还提出了训练-推理混合（TI-Mix）来弥合训练和生成分布之间的差距。

Result: 实验表明DC-Mix策略在计算效率和生成保真度之间取得了良好平衡，TI-Mix带来了持续改进。

Conclusion: MixAR通过离散-连续混合训练有效解决了连续自回归建模的挑战，在保持计算效率的同时提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) approaches, which represent images as sequences of discrete tokens from a finite codebook, have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, the quantization process and the limited codebook size inevitably discard fine-grained information, placing bottlenecks on fidelity. Motivated by this limitation, recent studies have explored autoregressive modeling in continuous latent spaces, which offers higher generation quality. Yet, unlike discrete tokens constrained by a fixed codebook, continuous representations lie in a vast and unstructured space, posing significant challenges for efficient autoregressive modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce MixAR, a novel framework that leverages mixture training paradigms to inject discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous AR modeling. MixAR is a factorized formulation that leverages discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous autoregressive prediction. We investigate several discrete-continuous mixture strategies, including self-attention (DC-SA), cross-attention (DC-CA), and a simple approach (DC-Mix) that replaces homogeneous mask tokens with informative discrete counterparts. Moreover, to bridge the gap between ground-truth training tokens and inference tokens produced by the pre-trained AR model, we propose Training-Inference Mixture (TI-Mix) to achieve consistent training and generation distributions. In our experiments, we demonstrate a favorable balance of the DC-Mix strategy between computational efficiency and generation fidelity, and consistent improvement of TI-Mix.

Abstract: Driver distraction remains a leading cause of road traffic accidents, contributing to thousands of fatalities annually across the globe. While deep learning-based driver activity recognition methods have shown promise in detecting such distractions, their effectiveness in real-world deployments is hindered by two critical challenges: variations in camera viewpoints (cross-view) and domain shifts such as change in sensor modality or environment. Existing methods typically address either cross-view generalization or unsupervised domain adaptation in isolation, leaving a gap in the robust and scalable deployment of models across diverse vehicle configurations. In this work, we propose a novel two-phase cross-view, cross-modal unsupervised domain adaptation framework that addresses these challenges jointly on real-time driver monitoring data. In the first phase, we learn view-invariant and action-discriminative features within a single modality using contrastive learning on multi-view data. In the second phase, we perform domain adaptation to a new modality using information bottleneck loss without requiring any labeled data from the new domain. We evaluate our approach using state-of-the art video transformers (Video Swin, MViT) and multi modal driver activity dataset called Drive&Act, demonstrating that our joint framework improves top-1 accuracy on RGB video data by almost 50% compared to a supervised contrastive learning-based cross-view method, and outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation-only methods by up to 5%, using the same video transformer backbone.

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to segment novel classes from target domains that are not involved in training and have significantly different data distributions from the source domain, using only a few annotated samples, and recent years have witnessed significant progress on this task. However, existing CD-FSS methods primarily focus on style gaps between source and target domains while ignoring segmentation granularity gaps, resulting in insufficient semantic discriminability for novel classes in target domains. Therefore, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic Learning (HSL) framework to tackle this problem. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Style Randomization (DSR) module and a Hierarchical Semantic Mining (HSM) module to learn hierarchical semantic features, thereby enhancing the model's ability to recognize semantics at varying granularities. DSR simulates target domain data with diverse foreground-background style differences and overall style variations through foreground and global style randomization respectively, while HSM leverages multi-scale superpixels to guide the model to mine intra-class consistency and inter-class distinction at different granularities. Additionally, we also propose a Prototype Confidence-modulated Thresholding (PCMT) module to mitigate segmentation ambiguity when foreground and background are excessively similar. Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular target domain datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: OmniSparse框架有效解决了现有稀疏注意力方法的局限性，实现了训练感知的细粒度稀疏注意力，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Existing sparse attention methods primarily target inference-time acceleration by selecting critical tokens under predefined sparsity patterns. However, they often fail to bridge the training-inference gap and lack the capacity for fine-grained token selection across multiple dimensions such as queries, key-values (KV), and heads, leading to suboptimal performance and limited acceleration gains. In this paper, we introduce OmniSparse, a training-aware fine-grained sparse attention framework for long-video MLLMs, which operates in both training and inference with dynamic token budget allocation. Specifically, OmniSparse contains three adaptive and complementary mechanisms: (1) query selection via lazy-active classification, retaining active queries that capture broad semantic similarity while discarding most lazy ones that focus on limited local context and exhibit high functional redundancy; (2) KV selection with head-level dynamic budget allocation, where a shared budget is determined based on the flattest head and applied uniformly across all heads to ensure attention recall; and (3) KV cache slimming to reduce head-level redundancy by selectively fetching visual KV cache according to the head-level decoding query pattern. Experimental results show that OmniSparse matches the performance of full attention while achieving up to 2.7x speedup during prefill and 2.4x memory reduction during decoding.

Conclusion: LSS3D方法能有效处理多视图不一致性和非正面输入，生成具有完整几何细节和清晰纹理的高质量3D模型

Abstract: Recently, multi-view diffusion-based 3D generation methods have gained significant attention. However, these methods often suffer from shape and texture misalignment across generated multi-view images, leading to low-quality 3D generation results, such as incomplete geometric details and textural ghosting. Some methods are mainly optimized for the frontal perspective and exhibit poor robustness to oblique perspective inputs. In this paper, to tackle the above challenges, we propose a high-quality image-to-3D approach, named LSS3D, with learnable spatial shifting to explicitly and effectively handle the multiview inconsistencies and non-frontal input view. Specifically, we assign learnable spatial shifting parameters to each view, and adjust each view towards a spatially consistent target, guided by the reconstructed mesh, resulting in high-quality 3D generation with more complete geometric details and clean textures. Besides, we include the input view as an extra constraint for the optimization, further enhancing robustness to non-frontal input angles, especially for elevated viewpoint inputs. We also provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation pipeline that can contribute to the community in performance comparisons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves leading results in both geometric and texture evaluation metrics across more flexible input viewpoints.

Abstract: Multi-view image generation holds significant application value in computer vision, particularly in domains like 3D reconstruction, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Most existing methods, which rely on extending single images, face notable computational challenges in maintaining cross-view consistency and generating high-resolution outputs. To address these issues, we propose the Geometry-guided Multi-View Diffusion Model, which incorporates mechanisms for extracting multi-view geometric information and adjusting the intensity of geometric features to generate images that are both consistent across views and rich in detail. Specifically, we design a multi-view geometry information extraction module that leverages depth maps, normal maps, and foreground segmentation masks to construct a shared geometric structure, ensuring shape and structural consistency across different views. To enhance consistency and detail restoration during generation, we develop a decoupled geometry-enhanced attention mechanism that strengthens feature focus on key geometric details, thereby improving overall image quality and detail preservation. Furthermore, we apply an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes the model to better capture spatial relationships and visual coherence between the generated views, ensuring realistic results. Our model also incorporates an iterative refinement process that progressively improves the output quality through multiple stages of image generation. Finally, a dynamic geometry information intensity adjustment mechanism is proposed to adaptively regulate the influence of geometric data, optimizing overall quality while ensuring the naturalness of generated images.

Abstract: Road safety is a critical global concern, with manual enforcement of helmet laws and vehicle safety standards (e.g., rear-view mirror presence) being resource-intensive and inconsistent. This paper presents an AI-powered system to automate traffic violation detection, significantly enhancing enforcement efficiency and road safety. The system leverages YOLOv8 for robust object detection and EasyOCR for license plate recognition. Trained on a custom dataset of annotated images (augmented for diversity), it identifies helmet non-compliance, the absence of rear-view mirrors on motorcycles, an innovative contribution to automated checks, and extracts vehicle registration numbers. A Streamlit-based interface facilitates real-time monitoring and violation logging. Advanced image preprocessing enhances license plate recognition, particularly under challenging conditions. Based on evaluation results, the model achieves an overall precision of 0.9147, a recall of 0.886, and a mean Average Precision (mAP@50) of 0.843. The mAP@50 95 of 0.503 further indicates strong detection capability under stricter IoU thresholds. This work demonstrates a practical and effective solution for automated traffic rule enforcement, with considerations for real-world deployment discussed.

Conclusion: MoS为多模态扩散模型提供了一种灵活且计算高效的扩展范式。

Abstract: We introduce MoS (Mixture of States), a novel fusion paradigm for multimodal diffusion models that merges modalities using flexible, state-based interactions. The core of MoS is a learnable, token-wise router that creates denoising timestep- and input-dependent interactions between modalities' hidden states, precisely aligning token-level features with the diffusion trajectory. This router sparsely selects the top-$k$ hidden states and is trained with an $ε$-greedy strategy, efficiently selecting contextual features with minimal learnable parameters and negligible computational overhead. We validate our design with text-to-image generation (MoS-Image) and editing (MoS-Editing), which achieve state-of-the-art results. With only 3B to 5B parameters, our models match or surpass counterparts up to $4\times$ larger. These findings establish MoS as a flexible and compute-efficient paradigm for scaling multimodal diffusion models.

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers significant potential for advancing medical image understanding by leveraging paired image-report data. However, existing methods are limited by Fa}lse Negatives (FaNe) induced by semantically similar texts and insufficient fine-grained cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose FaNe, a semantic-enhanced VLP framework. To mitigate false negatives, we introduce a semantic-aware positive pair mining strategy based on text-text similarity with adaptive normalization. Furthermore, we design a text-conditioned sparse attention pooling module to enable fine-grained image-text alignment through localized visual representations guided by textual cues. To strengthen intra-modal discrimination, we develop a hard-negative aware contrastive loss that adaptively reweights semantically similar negatives. Extensive experiments on five downstream medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that FaNe achieves state-of-the-art performance across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, validating the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently produce hallucinations in the form of descriptions of objects, attributes, or relations that do not exist in the image due to over-reliance on language priors and imprecise cross-modal grounding. We introduce Spectral Representation Filtering (SRF), a lightweight, training-free method to suppress such hallucinations by analyzing and correcting the covariance structure of the model's representations. SRF identifies low-rank hallucination modes through eigendecomposition of the covariance of the differences between features collected for truthful and hallucinatory captions, revealing structured biases in the feature space. A soft spectral filter then attenuates these modes in the feed-forward projection weights of deeper vLLM layers, equalizing feature variance while preserving semantic fidelity. Unlike decoding or retraining-based approaches, SRF operates entirely post-hoc, incurs zero inference overhead, and requires no architectural modifications. Across three families of VLMs (LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, and mPLUG-Owl2), SRF consistently reduces hallucination rates on MSCOCO, POPE-VQA, and other visual tasks benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading caption quality.

Abstract: Problem: Pancreas radiological imaging is challenging due to the small size, blurred boundaries, and variability of shape and position of the organ among patients. Goal: In this work we present MiniGPT-Pancreas, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), as an interactive chatbot to support clinicians in pancreas cancer diagnosis by integrating visual and textual information. Methods: MiniGPT-v2, a general-purpose MLLM, was fine-tuned in a cascaded way for pancreas detection, tumor classification, and tumor detection with multimodal prompts combining questions and computed tomography scans from the National Institute of Health (NIH), and Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) datasets. The AbdomenCT-1k dataset was used to detect the liver, spleen, kidney, and pancreas. Results: MiniGPT-Pancreas achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.595 and 0.550 for the detection of pancreas on NIH and MSD datasets, respectively. For the pancreas cancer classification task on the MSD dataset, accuracy, precision, and recall were 0.876, 0.874, and 0.878, respectively. When evaluating MiniGPT-Pancreas on the AbdomenCT-1k dataset for multi-organ detection, the IoU was 0.8399 for the liver, 0.722 for the kidney, 0.705 for the spleen, and 0.497 for the pancreas. For the pancreas tumor detection task, the IoU score was 0.168 on the MSD dataset. Conclusions: MiniGPT-Pancreas represents a promising solution to support clinicians in the classification of pancreas images with pancreas tumors. Future research is needed to improve the score on the detection task, especially for pancreas tumors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DHMI，首个针对深度哈希的扩散式模型反演框架，能在黑盒设置下成功重构高分辨率、高质量图像，揭示了深度哈希系统的严重隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度哈希虽然提高了检索效率，但带来了严重的隐私风险，包括从哈希码重构原始训练数据可能导致生物特征伪造和隐私泄露。然而针对深度哈希模型的模型反演攻击尚未被探索。

Method: DHMI首先对辅助数据集进行聚类得到语义哈希中心作为代理锚点，然后引入代理引导的去噪优化方法，利用融合分类一致性和哈希邻近度的新攻击指标动态选择候选样本，通过代理模型簇指导候选样本的细化。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，DHMI即使在最具挑战性的黑盒设置下也能成功重构高分辨率、高质量图像，在黑盒场景下优于现有的最先进模型反演攻击方法。

Conclusion: DHMI证实了深度哈希系统存在严重的隐私风险，提出的方法具有实际有效性，为深度哈希模型的安全性评估提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Deep hashing improves retrieval efficiency through compact binary codes, yet it introduces severe and often overlooked privacy risks. The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的疾病感知框架通过增强疾病感知能力和视觉语言对齐，有效解决了现有方法在医学图像分析中的局限性，为胸部X光报告生成提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology report generation from chest X-rays is an important task in artificial intelligence with the potential to greatly reduce radiologists' workload and shorten patient wait times. Despite recent advances, existing approaches often lack sufficient disease-awareness in visual representations and adequate vision-language alignment to meet the specialized requirements of medical image analysis. As a result, these models usually overlook critical pathological features on chest X-rays and struggle to generate clinically accurate reports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stage disease-aware framework for chest X-ray report generation. In Stage~1, our model learns Disease-Aware Semantic Tokens (DASTs) corresponding to specific pathology categories through cross-attention mechanisms and multi-label classification, while simultaneously aligning vision and language representations via contrastive learning. In Stage~2, we introduce a Disease-Visual Attention Fusion (DVAF) module to integrate disease-aware representations with visual features, along with a Dual-Modal Similarity Retrieval (DMSR) mechanism that combines visual and disease-specific similarities to retrieve relevant exemplars, providing contextual guidance during report generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., CheXpert Plus, IU X-ray, and MIMIC-CXR) demonstrate that our disease-aware framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in chest X-ray report generation, with significant improvements in clinical accuracy and linguistic quality.

Result: 在各种开源和闭源MLLMs上的广泛实验表明，Gemini-2.5-Pro在CrossVid上表现最佳，平均准确率为50.4%。深入案例研究显示大多数当前MLLMs在跨视频推理任务上表现挣扎。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在跨视频推理任务上存在困难，主要原因是无法整合或比较分布在多个视频中的证据进行推理。CrossVid有潜力指导未来增强MLLMs跨视频推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Cross-Video Reasoning (CVR) presents a significant challenge in video understanding, which requires simultaneous understanding of multiple videos to aggregate and compare information across groups of videos. Most existing video understanding benchmarks focus on single-video analysis, failing to assess the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to simultaneously reason over various videos. Recent benchmarks evaluate MLLMs' capabilities on multi-view videos that capture different perspectives of the same scene. However, their limited tasks hinder a thorough assessment of MLLMs in diverse real-world CVR scenarios. To this end, we introduce CrossVid, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning ability in cross-video contexts. Firstly, CrossVid encompasses a wide spectrum of hierarchical tasks, comprising four high-level dimensions and ten specific tasks, thereby closely reflecting the complex and varied nature of real-world video understanding. Secondly, CrossVid provides 5,331 videos, along with 9,015 challenging question-answering pairs, spanning single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended question formats. Through extensive experiments on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5-Pro performs best on CrossVid, achieving an average accuracy of 50.4%. Notably, our in-depth case study demonstrates that most current MLLMs struggle with CVR tasks, primarily due to their inability to integrate or compare evidence distributed across multiple videos for reasoning. These insights highlight the potential of CrossVid to guide future advancements in enhancing MLLMs' CVR capabilities.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) images offer rich fine-grained information but also present challenges in effective processing. Existing dynamic resolution and token pruning methods are constrained by a passive perception paradigm, suffering from increased redundancy when obtaining finer visual inputs. In this work, we explore a new active perception paradigm that enables models to revisit information-rich regions. First, we present LRS-GRO, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for active perception in UHR RS processing, encompassing 17 question types across global, region, and object levels, annotated via a semi-automatic pipeline. Building on LRS-GRO, we propose ZoomEarth, an adaptive cropping-zooming framework with a novel Region-Guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), ZoomEarth achieves state-of-the-art performance on LRS-GRO and, in the zero-shot setting, on three public UHR remote sensing benchmarks. Furthermore, ZoomEarth can be seamlessly integrated with downstream models for tasks such as cloud removal, denoising, segmentation, and image editing through simple tool interfaces, demonstrating strong versatility and extensibility.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Although transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable results, their high computational cost hinders clinical deployment. To address this issue, we propose TM-UNet, a novel lightweight framework that integrates token sequence modeling with an efficient memory mechanism for efficient medical segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale token-memory (MSTM) block that transforms 2D spatial features into token sequences through strategic spatial scanning, leveraging matrix memory cells to selectively retain and propagate discriminative contextual information across tokens. This novel token-memory mechanism acts as a dynamic knowledge store that captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient global reasoning without redundant computation. Our MSTM block further incorporates exponential gating to identify token effectiveness and multi-scale contextual extraction via parallel pooling operations, enabling hierarchical representation learning without computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TM-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse medical segmentation tasks with substantially reduced computation cost.

Motivation: 扩散式多模态大语言模型虽然具有强大的非自回归生成能力，但推理速度远慢于自回归模型，因为每个去噪步骤都需要对整个序列进行双向自注意力计算，导致立方级的解码复杂度。

Method: 提出D³ToM方法，使用前一步生成的决策令牌构建重要性图谱，保留最显著的令牌，通过相似性聚合合并其余冗余令牌，动态调整合并比例以适应不同的去噪步骤。

Conclusion: D³ToM是一个即插即用的模块，能有效解决扩散式多模态大语言模型推理速度慢的问题，无需改变模型参数即可实现加速。

Abstract: Diffusion-based multimodal large language models (Diffusion MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive non-autoregressive generative capabilities across vision-and-language tasks. However, Diffusion MLLMs exhibit substantially slower inference than autoregressive models: Each denoising step employs full bidirectional self-attention over the entire sequence, resulting in cubic decoding complexity that becomes computationally impractical with thousands of visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose D$^{3}$ToM, a Decider-guided dynamic token merging method that dynamically merges redundant visual tokens at different denoising steps to accelerate inference in Diffusion MLLMs. At each denoising step, D$^{3}$ToM uses decider tokens-the tokens generated in the previous denoising step-to build an importance map over all visual tokens. Then it maintains a proportion of the most salient tokens and merges the remainder through similarity-based aggregation. This plug-and-play module integrates into a single transformer layer, physically shortening the visual token sequence for all subsequent layers without altering model parameters. Moreover, D$^{3}$ToM employs a merge ratio that dynamically varies with each denoising step, aligns with the native decoding process of Diffusion MLLMs, achieving superior performance under equivalent computational budgets. Extensive experiments show that D$^{3}$ToM accelerates inference while preserving competitive performance. The code is released at https://github.com/bcmi/D3ToM-Diffusion-MLLM.

Core of our approach is a novel 3D calibration target, specifically designed and constructed to be concurrently perceived by all three sensing modalities. The target encodes features in planes, ChArUco, and active LED patterns, each tailored to the unique characteristics of LiDARs, RGB cameras, and event cameras respectively. This unique design enables a one-shot, joint extrinsic calibration process, in contrast to existing approaches that typically rely on separate, pairwise calibrations. Our calibration pipeline is designed to accurately calibrate complex vision systems in the context of autonomous driving, where precise multi-sensor alignment is critical. We validate our approach through an extensive experimental evaluation on a custom built dataset, recorded with an advanced autonomous driving sensor setup, confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method.

Conclusion: FreRec是一个独立的后处理步骤，兼容任何生成模型，可无缝集成到常见的医学GDA流程中

Abstract: Developing Medical AI relies on large datasets and easily suffers from data scarcity. Generative data augmentation (GDA) using AI generative models offers a solution to synthesize realistic medical images. However, the bias in GDA is often underestimated in medical domains, with concerns about the risk of introducing detrimental features generated by AI and harming downstream tasks. This paper identifies the frequency misalignment between real and synthesized images as one of the key factors underlying unreliable GDA and proposes the Frequency Recalibration (FreRec) method to reduce the frequency distributional discrepancy and thus improve GDA. FreRec involves (1) Statistical High-frequency Replacement (SHR) to roughly align high-frequency components and (2) Reconstructive High-frequency Mapping (RHM) to enhance image quality and reconstruct high-frequency details. Extensive experiments were conducted in various medical datasets, including brain MRIs, chest X-rays, and fundus images. The results show that FreRec significantly improves downstream medical image classification performance compared to uncalibrated AI-synthesized samples. FreRec is a standalone post-processing step that is compatible with any generative model and can integrate seamlessly with common medical GDA pipelines.

Abstract: Recent GS-based rendering has made significant progress for LiDAR, surpassing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in both quality and speed. However, these methods exhibit artifacts in extrapolated novel view synthesis due to the incomplete reconstruction from single traversal scans. To address this limitation, we present LiDAR-GS++, a LiDAR Gaussian Splatting reconstruction method enhanced by diffusion priors for real-time and high-fidelity re-simulation on public urban roads. Specifically, we introduce a controllable LiDAR generation model conditioned on coarsely extrapolated rendering to produce extra geometry-consistent scans and employ an effective distillation mechanism for expansive reconstruction. By extending reconstruction to under-fitted regions, our approach ensures global geometric consistency for extrapolative novel views while preserving detailed scene surfaces captured by sensors. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that LiDAR-GS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance for both interpolated and extrapolated viewpoints, surpassing existing GS and NeRF-based methods.

Conclusion: 该框架通过仅损失设计引入强时序归纳偏置，以模块化和数据高效的方式桥接静态和时序学习，只需在预提取特征上使用简单分类器即可实现。

Abstract: Real-world visual data rarely presents as isolated, static instances. Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的框架，将否定建模为联合嵌入空间中的子空间而非单点，通过构造球形区域来同时接近肯定描述和远离否定描述，显著提升VLMs的否定理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理否定提示时表现不佳，而基于大型否定数据集微调的方法会损害模型在肯定提示上的零样本性能。

Method: 将否定建模为嵌入空间中的子空间，构造两个球形区域分别围绕肯定和否定描述的嵌入，通过寻找既接近肯定描述又远离否定描述的中心方向来匹配图像。

Result: 在检索、多项选择和文本到图像任务中，该方法平均比先前方法提升否定理解能力约30%，同时保持了零样本性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VLMs的否定理解问题，在提升否定性能的同时不损害肯定提示的零样本能力，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with negation. Given a prompt like "retrieve (or generate) a street scene without pedestrians," they often fail to respect the "not." Existing methods address this limitation by fine-tuning on large negation datasets, but such retraining often compromises the model's zero-shot performance on affirmative prompts. We show that the embedding space of VLMs, such as CLIP, can be divided into semantically consistent subspaces. Based on this property, we propose a training-free framework that models negation as a subspace in the joint embedding space rather than a single point (Figure 1). To find the matching image for a caption such as "A but not N," we construct two spherical caps around the embeddings of A and N, and we score images by the central direction of the region that is close to A and far from N. Across retrieval, MCQ, and text-to-image tasks, our method improves negation understanding by about 30% on average over prior methods. It closes the gap between affirmative and negated prompts while preserving the zero-shot performance that fine-tuned models fail to maintain. Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的交叉口转向运动计数对于信号控制、交通管理和城市规划至关重要，传统基于图像平面的计算机视觉系统存在局限性。

Method: 将单个或多个基础设施摄像头检测到的车辆反投影到地面平面，在真实世界3D坐标中分析，并采用多摄像头弱融合方法。

Result: 单摄像头反投影能提高轨迹分类和转向运动计数的准确性，多摄像头融合能获得更高的精度。

Conclusion: 交通分析应该在地面平面而非图像平面上进行，反投影方法能显著提升转向运动计数的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate turning movement counts at intersections are important for signal control, traffic management and urban planning. Computer vision systems for automatic turning movement counts typically rely on visual analysis in the image plane of an infrastructure camera. Here we explore potential advantages of back-projecting vehicles detected in one or more infrastructure cameras to the ground plane for analysis in real-world 3D coordinates. For single-camera systems we find that back-projection yields more accurate trajectory classification and turning movement counts. We further show that even higher accuracy can be achieved through weak fusion of back-projected detections from multiple cameras. These results suggeest that traffic should be analyzed on the ground plane, not the image plane

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CLAReSNet混合架构，结合多尺度卷积和变换器注意力，通过自适应潜在瓶颈解决高光谱图像分类中的高维度、复杂光谱-空间相关性和训练样本不足等问题，在Indian Pines和Salinas数据集上达到99.71%和99.96%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高光谱维度、复杂光谱-空间相关性、训练样本有限且类别不平衡等关键挑战。CNN擅长局部特征提取，变换器能捕捉长程依赖，但单独使用效果不佳。

Method: CLAReSNet结合多尺度卷积提取和变换器风格注意力，使用自适应潜在瓶颈。包含多尺度卷积主干、增强卷积块注意力模块、双向RNN与多尺度光谱潜在注意力(MSLA)，MSLA通过自适应潜在令牌分配将复杂度从O(T²D)降至O(Tlog(T)D)。

Result: 在Indian Pines和Salinas数据集上分别达到99.71%和99.96%的总体准确率，显著超越HybridSN、SSRN和SpectralFormer等现有方法。

Conclusion: CLAReSNet在有限样本和严重类别不平衡条件下表现出色，学习的嵌入具有优越的类间可分性和紧凑的类内聚类。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces critical challenges, including high spectral dimensionality, complex spectral-spatial correlations, and limited training samples with severe class imbalance. While CNNs excel at local feature extraction and transformers capture long-range dependencies, their isolated application yields suboptimal results due to quadratic complexity and insufficient inductive biases. We propose CLAReSNet (Convolutional Latent Attention Residual Spectral Network), a hybrid architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutional extraction with transformer-style attention via an adaptive latent bottleneck. The model employs a multi-scale convolutional stem with deep residual blocks and an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module for hierarchical spatial features, followed by spectral encoder layers combining bidirectional RNNs (LSTM/GRU) with Multi-Scale Spectral Latent Attention (MSLA). MSLA reduces complexity from $\mathcal{O}(T^2D)$ to $\mathcal{O}(T\log(T)D)$ by adaptive latent token allocation (8-64 tokens) that scales logarithmically with the sequence length. Hierarchical cross-attention fusion dynamically aggregates multi-level representations for robust classification. Experiments conducted on the Indian Pines and Salinas datasets show state-of-the-art performance, achieving overall accuracies of 99.71% and 99.96%, significantly surpassing HybridSN, SSRN, and SpectralFormer. The learned embeddings exhibit superior inter-class separability and compact intra-class clustering, validating CLAReSNet's effectiveness under limited samples and severe class imbalance.

TL;DR: XAIGID-RewardBench是首个评估多模态大语言模型判断AI生成图像检测解释质量的基准，包含约3000个标注三元组，结果显示当前最佳模型得分88.76%，与人类98.30%的一致性存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于分类的AI生成图像检测方法无法像人类专家那样解释判断依据，降低了检测工具的可信度和说服力。虽然使用MLLMs生成解释成为趋势，但MLLMs在评估自身或其他MLLMs生成的解释质量方面的表现尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建包含约3000个标注三元组的基准数据集，这些数据来自不同图像生成模型和作为检测器的MLLMs，用于评估当前MLLMs作为奖励模型（评判者）的能力。

Result: 当前最佳奖励模型在该基准上得分88.76%，而人类标注者间一致性达到98.30%，表明当前MLLMs的推理能力与人类水平存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 需要进一步改进MLLMs的推理能力以缩小与人类水平的差距，基准分析揭示了这些模型常见的错误模式。

Abstract: Conventional, classification-based AI-generated image detection methods cannot explain why an image is considered real or AI-generated in a way a human expert would, which reduces the trustworthiness and persuasiveness of these detection tools for real-world applications. Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has recently become a trending solution to this issue. Further, to evaluate the quality of generated explanations, a common approach is to adopt an "MLLM as a judge" methodology to evaluate explanations generated by other MLLMs. However, how well those MLLMs perform when judging explanations for AI-generated image detection generated by themselves or other MLLMs has not been well studied. We therefore propose \textbf{XAIGID-RewardBench}, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of current MLLMs to judge the quality of explanations about whether an image is real or AI-generated. The benchmark consists of approximately 3,000 annotated triplets sourced from various image generation models and MLLMs as policy models (detectors) to assess the capabilities of current MLLMs as reward models (judges). Our results show that the current best reward model scored 88.76\% on this benchmark (while human inter-annotator agreement reaches 98.30\%), demonstrating that a visible gap remains between the reasoning abilities of today's MLLMs and human-level performance. In addition, we provide an analysis of common pitfalls that these models frequently encounter. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/RewardBench/XAIGID-RewardBench.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型训练数据主要依赖稀疏的互联网挖掘或手动输入标注，只能捕捉图像视觉内容的一小部分。密集标注更有价值但稀缺，传统文本标注管道在表达性、速度和专业领域（如多元文化图像和3D资产）存在明显不足。

Method: 开发音频驱动的在线标注平台，标注者通过语音叙述观察内容，同时将口语短语与图像区域或3D场景部分同步链接。平台整合语音转文字转录和注意力区域标记功能。

Result: 通过超过1,000名标注者在两个领域（文化多样性图像和3D场景）的案例研究，收集了包含3,531张图像、898个3D场景和7,460个3D对象的多模态数据集，包含20种语言的音频对齐密集标注。基于此数据集训练的模型在多语言能力上提升5%，文化对齐能力提升47%，3D空间能力提升54%。

Conclusion: DenseAnnotate平台为未来视觉语言研究提供了可行方法，能够应用于各种任务和多样化数据类型，解决了密集标注稀缺的问题。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse applications, there is a pressing need for task-centered, high-quality training data. A key limitation of current training datasets is their reliance on sparse annotations mined from the Internet or entered via manual typing that capture only a fraction of an image's visual content. Dense annotations are more valuable but remain scarce. Traditional text-based annotation pipelines are poorly suited for creating dense annotations: typing limits expressiveness, slows annotation speed, and underrepresents nuanced visual features, especially in specialized areas such as multicultural imagery and 3D asset annotation. In this paper, we present DenseAnnotate, an audio-driven online annotation platform that enables efficient creation of dense, fine-grained annotations for images and 3D assets. Annotators narrate observations aloud while synchronously linking spoken phrases to image regions or 3D scene parts. Our platform incorporates speech-to-text transcription and region-of-attention marking. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DenseAnnotate, we conducted case studies involving over 1,000 annotators across two domains: culturally diverse images and 3D scenes. We curate a human-annotated multi-modal dataset of 3,531 images, 898 3D scenes, and 7,460 3D objects, with audio-aligned dense annotations in 20 languages, including 8,746 image captions, 2,000 scene captions, and 19,000 object captions. Models trained on this dataset exhibit improvements of 5% in multilingual, 47% in cultural alignment, and 54% in 3D spatial capabilities. Our results show that our platform offers a feasible approach for future vision-language research and can be applied to various tasks and diverse types of data.

Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法依赖任务特定的监督微调和架构设计，缺乏统一解决方案，限制了跨任务和跨模态的泛化能力。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习框架，训练大语言模型构建视觉输入的数字孪生表示，并通过验证结构完整性和输出准确性的奖励机制进行优化。

Result: 在涵盖两种模态和四种任务类型的六个视觉推理基准测试中，DT-R1始终优于最先进的任务特定模型。

Conclusion: DT-R1开创了通过数字孪生表示的强化学习实现视觉推理的新方向。

Abstract: Visual reasoning may require models to interpret images and videos and respond to implicit text queries across diverse output formats, from pixel-level segmentation masks to natural language descriptions. Existing approaches rely on supervised fine-tuning with task-specific architectures. For example, reasoning segmentation, grounding, summarization, and visual question answering each demand distinct model designs and training, preventing unified solutions and limiting cross-task and cross-modality generalization. Hence, we propose DT-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to construct digital twin representations of complex multi-modal visual inputs and then reason over these high-level representations as a unified approach to visual reasoning. Specifically, we train DT-R1 using GRPO with a novel reward that validates both structural integrity and output accuracy. Evaluations in six visual reasoning benchmarks, covering two modalities and four task types, demonstrate that DT-R1 consistently achieves improvements over state-of-the-art task-specific models. DT-R1 opens a new direction where visual reasoning emerges from reinforcement learning with digital twin representations.

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了房间布局和家具摆放的联合优化，在解决方案质量和计算效率方面均表现出色

Abstract: We present a novel framework for automated interior design that combines large language models (LLMs) with grid-based integer programming to jointly optimize room layout and furniture placement. Given a textual prompt, the LLM-driven agent workflow extracts structured design constraints related to room configurations and furniture arrangements. These constraints are encoded into a unified grid-based representation inspired by ``Modulor". Our formulation accounts for key design requirements, including corridor connectivity, room accessibility, spatial exclusivity, and user-specified preferences. To improve computational efficiency, we adopt a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy that begins with a low-resolution grid to solve a simplified problem and guides the solution at the full resolution. Experimental results across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our joint optimization approach significantly outperforms existing two-stage design pipelines in solution quality, and achieves notable computational efficiency through the coarse-to-fine strategy.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效的实时推理分割，可在资源受限环境中部署，为具身智能系统在真实世界环境中的自主运行提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation enables open-set object segmentation via implicit text queries, therefore serving as a foundation for embodied agents that should operate autonomously in real-world environments. However, existing methods for reasoning segmentation require multimodal large language models with billions of parameters that exceed the computational capabilities of edge devices that typically deploy the embodied AI systems. Distillation offers a pathway to compress these models while preserving their capabilities. Yet, existing distillation approaches fail to transfer the multi-step reasoning capabilities that reasoning segmentation demands, as they focus on matching output predictions and intermediate features rather than preserving reasoning chains. The emerging paradigm of reasoning over digital twin representations presents an opportunity for more effective distillation by re-framing the problem. Consequently, we propose FastReasonSeg, which employs digital twin representations that decouple perception from reasoning to enable more effective distillation. Our distillation scheme first relies on supervised fine-tuning on teacher-generated reasoning chains. Then it is followed by reinforcement fine-tuning with joint rewards evaluating both segmentation accuracy and reasoning quality alignment. Experiments on two video (JiTBench, RVTBench) and two image benchmarks (ReasonSeg, LLM-Seg40K) demonstrate that our FastReasonSeg achieves state-of-the-art reasoning segmentation performance. Moreover, the distilled 0.6B variant outperforms models with 20 times more parameters while achieving 7.79 FPS throughput with only 2.1GB memory consumption. This efficiency enables deployment in resource-constrained environments to enable real-time reasoning segmentation.

Abstract: Online Scene Change Detection (SCD) is an extremely challenging problem that requires an agent to detect relevant changes on the fly while observing the scene from unconstrained viewpoints. Existing online SCD methods are significantly less accurate than offline approaches. We present the first online SCD approach that is pose-agnostic, label-free, and ensures multi-view consistency, while operating at over 10 FPS and achieving new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even the best offline approaches. Our method introduces a new self-supervised fusion loss to infer scene changes from multiple cues and observations, PnP-based fast pose estimation against the reference scene, and a fast change-guided update strategy for the 3D Gaussian Splatting scene representation. Extensive experiments on complex real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms both online and offline baselines.

Conclusion: 数字孪生表示结合LLM推理能够有效处理隐含查询，显著提升文本到视频检索的性能和推理能力

Abstract: The goal of text-to-video retrieval is to search large databases for relevant videos based on text queries. Existing methods have progressed to handling explicit queries where the visual content of interest is described explicitly; however, they fail with implicit queries where identifying videos relevant to the query requires reasoning. We introduce reasoning text-to-video retrieval, a paradigm that extends traditional retrieval to process implicit queries through reasoning while providing object-level grounding masks that identify which entities satisfy the query conditions. Instead of relying on vision-language models directly, we propose representing video content as digital twins, i.e., structured scene representations that decompose salient objects through specialist vision models. This approach is beneficial because it enables large language models to reason directly over long-horizon video content without visual token compression. Specifically, our two-stage framework first performs compositional alignment between decomposed sub-queries and digital twin representations for candidate identification, then applies large language model-based reasoning with just-in-time refinement that invokes additional specialist models to address information gaps. We construct a benchmark of 447 manually created implicit queries with 135 videos (ReasonT2VBench-135) and another more challenging version of 1000 videos (ReasonT2VBench-1000). Our method achieves 81.2% R@1 on ReasonT2VBench-135, outperforming the strongest baseline by greater than 50 percentage points, and maintains 81.7% R@1 on the extended configuration while establishing state-of-the-art results in three conventional benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, and VATEX).

Conclusion: AGGRNet能有效改善复杂医学图像分析任务的分类性能

Abstract: Medical image analysis for complex tasks such as severity grading and disease subtype classification poses significant challenges due to intricate and similar visual patterns among classes, scarcity of labeled data, and variability in expert interpretations. Despite the usefulness of existing attention-based models in capturing complex visual patterns for medical image classification, underlying architectures often face challenges in effectively distinguishing subtle classes since they struggle to capture inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, resulting in incorrect diagnosis. To address this, we propose AGGRNet framework to extract informative and non-informative features to effectively understand fine-grained visual patterns and improve classification for complex medical image analysis tasks. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various medical imaging datasets, with the best improvement up to 5% over SOTA models on the Kvasir dataset.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to diagnose and differentiate kidney stones, cysts, and tumors using Computed Tomography (CT) images of the kidney. This study leverages a hybrid quantum-classical framework in this regard. We combine a pretrained ResNet50 encoder, with a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) to explore quantum-assisted diagnosis. We pre-process the kidney images using denoising and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to enhance feature extraction. We address class imbalance through data augmentation and weighted sampling. Latent features extracted by the encoder are transformed into qubits via angle encoding and processed by a QCNN. The model is evaluated on both 8-qubit and 12-qubit configurations. Both architectures achieved rapid convergence with stable learning curves and high consistency between training and validation performance. The models reached a test accuracy of 0.99, with the 12-qubit configuration providing improvements in overall recall and precision, particularly for Cyst and Tumor detection, where it achieved perfect recall for Cysts and a tumor F1-score of 0.9956. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed reliable classification behavior across all classes, with very few misclassifications. Results demonstrate that integrating classical pre-processing and deep feature extraction with quantum circuits enhances medical diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了实用的自调节视觉推理，通过正交不确定性分解显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Most estimators collapse all uncertainty modes into a single confidence score, preventing reliable reasoning about when to allocate more compute or adjust inference. We introduce Uncertainty-Guided Inference-Time Selection, a lightweight inference time framework that disentangles aleatoric (data-driven) and epistemic (model-driven) uncertainty directly in deep feature space. Aleatoric uncertainty is estimated using a regularized global density model, while epistemic uncertainty is formed from three complementary components that capture local support deficiency, manifold spectral collapse, and cross-layer feature inconsistency. These components are empirically orthogonal and require no sampling, no ensembling, and no additional forward passes. We integrate the decomposed uncertainty into a distribution free conformal calibration procedure that yields significantly tighter prediction intervals at matched coverage. Using these components for uncertainty guided adaptive model selection reduces compute by approximately 60 percent on MOT17 with negligible accuracy loss, enabling practical self regulating visual inference. Additionally, our ablation results show that the proposed orthogonal uncertainty decomposition consistently yields higher computational savings across all MOT17 sequences, improving margins by 13.6 percentage points over the total-uncertainty baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低秩适配方法主要局限于视觉变换器(ViTs)，难以在不同架构间通用化。需要一种统一的方法来适配卷积神经网络(CNNs)和ViTs。

Method: 结合低秩线性投影和多尺度非线性变换，通过点乘和残差连接融合两个组件，联合调制空间和通道注意力，保持预训练权重冻结。

Conclusion: MSLoRA通过重新加权而非重新调整，为冻结视觉主干网络的高效适配提供了一种简单通用的方法。

Abstract: We introduce MSLoRA, a backbone-agnostic, parameter-efficient adapter that reweights feature responses rather
  than re-tuning the underlying backbone. Existing low-rank adaptation methods are mostly confined to vision
  transformers (ViTs) and struggle to generalize across architectures. MSLoRA unifies adaptation for both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
  ViTs by combining a low-rank linear projection with a multi-scale nonlinear transformation that jointly
  modulates spatial and channel attention. The two components are fused through pointwise multiplication and
  a residual connection, yielding a lightweight module that shifts feature attention while keeping pretrained
  weights frozen.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSLoRA consistently improves transfer performance on classification,

Abstract: Exploring open-world situations in an end-to-end manner is a promising yet challenging task due to the need for strong generalization capabilities. In particular, end-to-end autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments often encounters conditions that were unfamiliar during training. In this work, we present Vision-Language Action Retrieval (VLA-R), an open-world end-to-end autonomous driving (OW-E2EAD) framework that integrates open-world perception with a novel vision-action retrieval paradigm. We leverage a frozen vision-language model for open-world detection and segmentation to obtain multi-scale, prompt-guided, and interpretable perception features without domain-specific tuning. A Q-Former bottleneck aggregates fine-grained visual representations with language-aligned visual features, bridging perception and action domains. To learn transferable driving behaviors, we introduce a vision-action contrastive learning scheme that aligns vision-language and action embeddings for effective open-world reasoning and action retrieval. Our experiments on a real-world robotic platform demonstrate strong generalization and exploratory performance in unstructured, unseen environments, even with limited data. Demo videos are provided in the supplementary material.

Abstract: The deployment of automated pavement defect detection is often hindered by poor cross-domain generalization. Supervised detectors achieve strong in-domain accuracy but require costly re-annotation for new environments, while standard self-supervised methods capture generic features and remain vulnerable to domain shift. We propose \ours, a self-supervised framework that \emph{visually probes} target domains without labels. \ours introduces a Self-supervised Prompt Enhancement Module (SPEM), which derives defect-aware prompts from unlabeled target data to guide a frozen ViT backbone, and a Domain-Aware Prompt Alignment (DAPA) objective, which aligns prompt-conditioned source and target representations. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms strong supervised, self-supervised, and adaptation baselines, achieving robust zero-shot transfer, improved resilience to domain variations, and high data efficiency in few-shot adaptation. These results highlight self-supervised prompting as a practical direction for building scalable and adaptive visual inspection systems.

Motivation: 现有基于姿态的成像几何方法在SfM中表现出色，但需要进一步探索场景结构、旋转和平移之间的关键关系。本文发现平移可以表示为旋转的函数，从而可以将成像几何表示压缩到旋转流形上。

Method: 提出基于重投影误差的旋转优化框架，将平移表示为旋转的函数，将成像几何表示压缩到旋转流形上，适用于双视图和多视图场景。

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于实现更准确、高效和可靠的3D视觉计算，通过旋转流形表示简化了成像几何优化问题。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) is a critical task in computer vision, aiming to recover the 3D scene structure and camera motion from a sequence of 2D images. The recent pose-only imaging geometry decouples 3D coordinates from camera poses and demonstrates significantly better SfM performance through pose adjustment. Continuing the pose-only perspective, this paper explores the critical relationship between the scene structures, rotation and translation. Notably, the translation can be expressed in terms of rotation, allowing us to condense the imaging geometry representation onto the rotation manifold. A rotation-only optimization framework based on reprojection error is proposed for both two-view and multi-view scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness performance over the current state-of-the-art rotation estimation methods, even comparable to multiple bundle adjustment iteration results. Hopefully, this work contributes to even more accurate, efficient and reliable 3D visual computing.

Motivation: 真实世界图像常受恶劣天气影响而退化，现有的天气恢复方法可能会牺牲对分析小物体至关重要的高频细节。简单的去雨和超分辨率级联方法存在内在冲突：去雨旨在去除高频天气噪声，而超分辨率旨在从现有细节中生成高频纹理。

Method: 提出DHGM模型，集成预训练扩散先验与高通滤波器，同时去除雨滴伪影和增强结构细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，DHGM在性能上优于现有方法，且成本更低。

Conclusion: DHGM通过扩散先验和高频引导，有效解决了去雨和超分辨率之间的冲突，能够生成既干净又高分辨率的图像。

Abstract: Clean images are crucial for visual tasks such as small object detection, especially at high resolutions. However, real-world images are often degraded by adverse weather, and weather restoration methods may sacrifice high-frequency details critical for analyzing small objects. A natural solution is to apply super-resolution (SR) after weather removal to recover both clarity and fine structures. However, simply cascading restoration and SR struggle to bridge their inherent conflict: removal aims to remove high-frequency weather-induced noise, while SR aims to hallucinate high-frequency textures from existing details, leading to inconsistent restoration contents. In this paper, we take deraining as a case study and propose DHGM, a Diffusion-based High-frequency Guided Model for generating clean and high-resolution images. DHGM integrates pre-trained diffusion priors with high-pass filters to simultaneously remove rain artifacts and enhance structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DHGM achieves superior performance over existing methods, with lower costs.

Motivation: 受ResNet与ODE的关联性以及MeanFlow一步生成模型的启发，探索生成流场如何有效表征ResNet中的特征变换过程。

Method: 压缩阶段：将每个ResNet阶段的多层结构简化为1-2个MeanFlow模块构建轻量元模型；扩展阶段：对前三个阶段应用选择性孵化策略，扩展到基准ResNet的残差块配置，保持最后阶段为MeanFlow形式并进行微调。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，相比ResNet-50分别减少参数46.28%和45.59%，同时准确率提升0.23%和0.17%。

Conclusion: 生成流场能有效表征ResNet中的特征变换过程，为理解生成建模与判别学习的关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: ResNet has achieved tremendous success in computer vision through its residual connection mechanism. ResNet can be viewed as a discretized form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). From this perspective, the multiple residual blocks within a single ResNet stage essentially perform multi-step discrete iterations of the feature transformation for that stage. The recently proposed flow matching model, MeanFlow, enables one-step generative modeling by learning the mean velocity field to transform distributions. Inspired by this, we propose MeanFlow-Incubated ResNet (MFI-ResNet), which employs a compression-expansion strategy to jointly improve parameter efficiency and discriminative performance. In the compression phase, we simplify the multi-layer structure within each ResNet stage to one or two MeanFlow modules to construct a lightweight meta model. In the expansion phase, we apply a selective incubation strategy to the first three stages, expanding them to match the residual block configuration of the baseline ResNet model, while keeping the last stage in MeanFlow form, and fine-tune the incubated model. Experimental results show that on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, MFI-ResNet achieves remarkable parameter efficiency, reducing parameters by 46.28% and 45.59% compared to ResNet-50, while still improving accuracy by 0.23% and 0.17%, respectively. This demonstrates that generative flow-fields can effectively characterize the feature transformation process in ResNet, providing a new perspective for understanding the relationship between generative modeling and discriminative learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散视觉语言模型(DVLMs)虽然支持并行token解码，但大量视觉token严重阻碍了推理效率。目前视觉token剪枝主要针对自回归VLMs，在DVLMs中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出RedVTP策略，利用掩码响应token的注意力来估计视觉token重要性，基于重要性分数在推理步骤中保持一致的观察，在第一步推理后剪枝不重要的视觉token。

Result: 在LLaDA-V和LaViDa模型上，token生成吞吐量分别提升186%和28.05%，推理延迟分别降低64.97%和21.87%，且精度未受影响甚至有所提升。

Conclusion: RedVTP有效解决了DVLMs的推理效率问题，通过响应驱动的视觉token剪枝实现了显著的性能提升，为高效多模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning and generation, yet their high computational demands remain a major challenge. Diffusion Vision-Language Models (DVLMs) are particularly attractive because they enable parallel token decoding, but the large number of visual tokens still significantly hinders their inference efficiency. While visual token pruning has been extensively studied for autoregressive VLMs (AVLMs), it remains largely unexplored for DVLMs. In this work, we propose RedVTP, a response-driven visual token pruning strategy that leverages the inference dynamics of DVLMs. Our method estimates visual token importance using attention from the masked response tokens. Based on the observation that these importance scores remain consistent across steps, RedVTP prunes the less important visual tokens from the masked tokens after the first inference step, thereby maximizing inference efficiency. Experiments show that RedVTP improves token generation throughput of LLaDA-V and LaViDa by up to 186% and 28.05%, respectively, and reduces inference latency by up to 64.97% and 21.87%, without compromising-and in some cases improving-accuracy.

Result: 在多种多模态图像融合和下游任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UP-Fusion框架有效解决了多模态融合中的梯度冲突和泛化问题，显著提升了融合性能。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion enhances scene perception by combining complementary information. Unified models aim to share parameters across modalities for multi-modality image fusion, but large modality differences often cause gradient conflicts, limiting performance. Some methods introduce modality-specific encoders to enhance feature perception and improve fusion quality. However, this strategy reduces generalisation across different fusion tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a unified multi-modality image fusion framework based on channel perturbation and pre-trained knowledge integration (UP-Fusion). To suppress redundant modal information and emphasize key features, we propose the Semantic-Aware Channel Pruning Module (SCPM), which leverages the semantic perception capability of a pre-trained model to filter and enhance multi-modality feature channels. Furthermore, we proposed the Geometric Affine Modulation Module (GAM), which uses original modal features to apply affine transformations on initial fusion features to maintain the feature encoder modal discriminability. Finally, we apply a Text-Guided Channel Perturbation Module (TCPM) during decoding to reshape the channel distribution, reducing the dependence on modality-specific channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods on both multi-modality image fusion and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种非侵入式、低成本且有效的疲劳检测解决方案，可集成到智能汽车技术中，有助于预防道路事故

Abstract: A long road trip is fun for drivers. However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness. Our proposed and implemented DCNNs embedded drowsiness detection model successfully react with NTHU-DDD dataset and Yawn-Eye-Dataset with drowsiness detection classification accuracy of 99.6% and 97% respectively.

Conclusion: CoTBox-TTT是一种无需标签、即插即用的方法，适用于实际部署，能有效提升医学VQA在领域转移下的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering could support clinical decision making, yet current systems often fail under domain shift and produce answers that are weakly grounded in image evidence. This reliability gap arises when models attend to spurious regions and when retraining or additional labels are impractical at deployment time. We address this setting with CoTBox-TTT, an evidence-first test-time training approach that adapts a vision-language model at inference while keeping all backbones frozen. The method updates only a small set of continuous soft prompts. It identifies question-relevant regions through a visual chain-of-thought signal and encourages answer consistency across the original image and a localized crop. The procedure is label free, and plug and play with diverse backbones. Experiments on medical VQA show that the approach is practical for real deployments. For instance, adding CoTBox-TTT to LLaVA increases closed-ended accuracy by 12.3% on pathVQA.

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce calls for multimodal models that comprehend rich visual and textual product information. Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for product understanding exhibit strong capability in representation learning for e-commerce, they still face three challenges: (i) the modality imbalance induced by modality mixed training; (ii) underutilization of the intrinsic alignment relationships among visual and textual information within a product; and (iii) limited handling of noise in e-commerce multimodal data. To address these, we propose MOON2.0, a dynamic modality-balanced multimodal representation learning framework for e-commerce product understanding. MOON2.0 comprises: (1) a Modality-driven Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module that adaptively processes input samples by their modality composition, enabling Multimodal Joint Learning to mitigate the modality imbalance; (2) a Dual-level Alignment method to better leverage semantic alignment properties inside individual products; and (3) an MLLM-based Image-text Co-augmentation strategy that integrates textual enrichment with visual expansion, coupled with Dynamic Sample Filtering to improve training data quality. We further introduce MBE2.0, a co-augmented multimodal representation benchmark for e-commerce representation learning and evaluation. Experiments show that MOON2.0 delivers state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MBE2.0 and multiple public datasets. Furthermore, attention-based heatmap visualization provides qualitative evidence of improved multimodal alignment of MOON2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像掩码存在像素利用不足和关键特征丢失问题，而MIM表明掩码区域可以从部分输入重建，具有与原始图像的强上下文一致性，这揭示了掩码区域作为语义多样性来源的潜力。

Method: 提出MaskAnyNet，结合掩码和重新学习机制，通过额外分支从重新组合的掩码区域联合学习，利用掩码区域的语义多样性来丰富特征。

Result: 在CNN和Transformer骨干网络上的实验显示，在多个基准测试中均获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过重用掩码内容改善了语义多样性，证明了将掩码区域作为辅助知识的有效性。

Abstract: In supervised learning, traditional image masking faces two key issues: (i) discarded pixels are underutilized, leading to a loss of valuable contextual information; (ii) masking may remove small or critical features, especially in fine-grained tasks. In contrast, masked image modeling (MIM) has demonstrated that masked regions can be reconstructed from partial input, revealing that even incomplete data can exhibit strong contextual consistency with the original image. This highlights the potential of masked regions as sources of semantic diversity. Motivated by this, we revisit the image masking approach, proposing to treat masked content as auxiliary knowledge rather than ignored. Based on this, we propose MaskAnyNet, which combines masking with a relearning mechanism to exploit both visible and masked information. It can be easily extended to any model with an additional branch to jointly learn from the recomposed masked region. This approach leverages the semantic diversity of the masked regions to enrich features and preserve fine-grained details. Experiments on CNN and Transformer backbones show consistent gains across multiple benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that the proposed method improves semantic diversity through the reuse of masked content.

Motivation: 现有基于相机的3D语义场景补全方法主要关注增强帧内区域，但难以重建自车侧方关键视野外区域，尽管历史帧通常包含这些不可见区域的宝贵上下文信息。

Method: 提出C3DFusion模块，通过历史上下文模糊和当前中心特征致密化两种互补技术进行增强的时间融合：通过衰减尺度抑制不准确扭曲历史点特征的噪声，通过增加体积贡献增强当前点特征。

Conclusion: C3DFusion模块简单集成到标准SSC架构中即可展现强大效果，为解决视野外区域重建问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) methods have increasingly explored leveraging temporal cues to enrich the features of the current frame. However, while these approaches primarily focus on enhancing in-frame regions, they often struggle to reconstruct critical out-of-frame areas near the sides of the ego-vehicle, although previous frames commonly contain valuable contextual information about these unseen regions. To address this limitation, we propose the Current-Centric Contextual 3D Fusion (C3DFusion) module, which generates hidden region-aware 3D feature geometry by explicitly aligning 3D-lifted point features from both current and historical frames. C3DFusion performs enhanced temporal fusion through two complementary techniques-historical context blurring and current-centric feature densification-which suppress noise from inaccurately warped historical point features by attenuating their scale, and enhance current point features by increasing their volumetric contribution. Simply integrated into standard SSC architectures, C3DFusion demonstrates strong effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Furthermore, it exhibits robust generalization, achieving notable performance gains when applied to other baseline models.

Conclusion: 提出的新范式使基于结构的重定位变得可行，无需依赖图像检索或搜索启发式。

Abstract: Accurate camera pose estimation from an image observation in a previously mapped environment is commonly done through structure-based methods: by finding correspondences between 2D keypoints on the image and 3D structure points in the map. In order to make this correspondence search tractable in large scenes, existing pipelines either rely on search heuristics, or perform image retrieval to reduce the search space by comparing the current image to a database of past observations. However, these approaches result in elaborate pipelines or storage requirements that grow with the number of past observations. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for making structure-based relocalisation tractable. Instead of relying on image retrieval or search heuristics, we learn a direct mapping from image observations to the visible scene structure in a compact neural network. Given a query image, a forward pass through our novel visible structure retrieval network allows obtaining the subset of 3D structure points in the map that the image views, thus reducing the search space of 2D-3D correspondences. We show that our proposed method enables performing localisation with an accuracy comparable to the state of the art, while requiring lower computational and storage footprint.

Abstract: With growing concerns over image authenticity and digital safety, the field of AI-generated image (AIGI) detection has progressed rapidly. Yet, most AIGI detectors still struggle under real-world degradations, particularly motion blur, which frequently occurs in handheld photography, fast motion, and compressed video. Such blur distorts fine textures and suppresses high-frequency artifacts, causing severe performance drops in real-world settings. We address this limitation with a blur-robust AIGI detection framework based on teacher-student knowledge distillation. A high-capacity teacher (DINOv3), trained on clean (i.e., sharp) images, provides stable and semantically rich representations that serve as a reference for learning. By freezing the teacher to maintain its generalization ability, we distill its feature and logit responses from sharp images to a student trained on blurred counterparts, enabling the student to produce consistent representations under motion degradation. Extensive experiments benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under both motion-blurred and clean conditions, demonstrating improved generalization and real-world applicability.

*Jing Li,Yifan Wang,Jiafeng Yan,Renlong Zhang,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法处理恶劣天气条件下可见光图像的退化问题，且采用固定网络架构难以适应多样化的退化场景。

Method: 使用混合专家系统处理多退化场景，利用预训练视觉语言模型提取语义先验，提出退化感知通道注意力模块进行多模态特征交互，并通过语义先验指导专家路由。

Result: 大量实验验证了MdaIF的有效性，在复杂退化场景下表现出优于现有最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: MdaIF框架能够有效解决多退化场景下的图像融合问题，通过退化感知机制和自适应架构实现了鲁棒的融合性能。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary multi-modal information into a single fused result. However, existing methods 1) fail to account for the degradation visible images under adverse weather conditions, thereby compromising fusion performance; and 2) rely on fixed network architectures, limiting their adaptability to diverse degradation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a one-stop degradation-aware image fusion framework for multi-degradation scenarios driven by a large language model (MdaIF). Given the distinct scattering characteristics of different degradation scenarios (e.g., haze, rain, and snow) in atmospheric transmission, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) system is introduced to tackle image fusion across multiple degradation scenarios. To adaptively extract diverse weather-aware degradation knowledge and scene feature representations, collectively referred to as the semantic prior, we employ a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) in our framework. Guided by the semantic prior, we propose degradation-aware channel attention module (DCAM), which employ degradation prototype decomposition to facilitate multi-modal feature interaction in channel domain. In addition, to achieve effective expert routing, the semantic prior and channel-domain modulated features are utilized to guide the MoE, enabling robust image fusion in complex degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our MdaIF, demonstrating superior performance over SOTA methods.

### [125] [D$^{2}$-VPR: A Parameter-efficient Visual-foundation-model-based Visual Place Recognition Method via Knowledge Distillation and Deformable Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12528)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Jiwei Zhang,Boyu Zhou,Linzhimeng Duan,Hong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了D²-VPR框架，通过知识蒸馏和可变形聚合器来平衡视觉位置识别任务的性能和效率，在保持DINOv2强大特征提取能力的同时显著减少模型参数和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DINOv2等视觉基础模型虽然显著提升了VPR性能，但模型复杂度和计算开销过大，难以在资源受限设备上部署。需要一种既能保留强大特征提取能力又能降低计算成本的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：知识蒸馏+微调，并引入蒸馏恢复模块来对齐师生模型特征空间；设计基于自上而下注意力的可变形聚合器，利用全局语义特征动态调整感兴趣区域。

Result: 在保持竞争力的性能同时，参数数量减少约64.2%，FLOPs减少约62.6%（相比CricaVPR）。

Conclusion: D²-VPR框架成功实现了视觉位置识别任务中性能与效率的良好平衡，为资源受限环境下的部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to determine the geographic location of a query image by retrieving its most visually similar counterpart from a geo-tagged reference database. Recently, the emergence of the powerful visual foundation model, DINOv2, trained in a self-supervised manner on massive datasets, has significantly improved VPR performance. This improvement stems from DINOv2's exceptional feature generalization capabilities but is often accompanied by increased model complexity and computational overhead that impede deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, we propose $D^{2}$-VPR, a $D$istillation- and $D$eformable-based framework that retains the strong feature extraction capabilities of visual foundation models while significantly reducing model parameters and achieving a more favorable performance-efficiency trade-off. Specifically, first, we employ a two-stage training strategy that integrates knowledge distillation and fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a Distillation Recovery Module (DRM) to better align the feature spaces between the teacher and student models, thereby minimizing knowledge transfer losses to the greatest extent possible. Second, we design a Top-Down-attention-based Deformable Aggregator (TDDA) that leverages global semantic features to dynamically and adaptively adjust the Regions of Interest (ROI) used for aggregation, thereby improving adaptability to irregular structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, it reduces the parameter count by approximately 64.2% and FLOPs by about 62.6% (compared to CricaVPR).Code is available at https://github.com/tony19980810/D2VPR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReaSon是一个通过强化学习选择关键帧的框架，使用因果信息瓶颈原则来确保所选帧既具有预测充分性又具有因果必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉语言模型的输入标记有限，且视频帧中相关信息具有时间稀疏性，需要选择既信息丰富又具有因果决定性的关键帧。

Method: 使用可学习的策略网络从视觉相关候选帧中选择关键帧，通过反事实干预评估因果必要性，并设计符合CIB原则的复合奖励来指导强化学习。

Result: 在NExT-QA、EgoSchema和Video-MME数据集上的实验表明，ReaSon在有限帧设置下始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ReaSon框架通过因果信息瓶颈原则有效解决了关键帧选择问题，具有良好的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Keyframe selection has become essential for video understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) due to limited input tokens and the temporal sparsity of relevant information across video frames. Video understanding often relies on effective keyframes that are not only informative but also causally decisive. To this end, we propose Reinforced Causal Search with Information Bottleneck (ReaSon), a framework that formulates keyframe selection as an optimization problem with the help of a novel Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), which explicitly defines keyframes as those satisfying both predictive sufficiency and causal necessity. Specifically, ReaSon employs a learnable policy network to select keyframes from a visually relevant pool of candidate frames to capture predictive sufficiency, and then assesses causal necessity via counterfactual interventions. Finally, a composite reward aligned with the CIB principle is designed to guide the selection policy through reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on NExT-QA, EgoSchema, and Video-MME demonstrate that ReaSon consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under limited-frame settings, validating its effectiveness and generalization ability.

### [127] [HiGFA: Hierarchical Guidance for Fine-grained Data Augmentation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12547)
*Zhiguang Lu,Qianqian Xu,Peisong Wen,Siran Da,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HiGFA方法，通过分层引导策略在扩散模型采样过程中实现细粒度数据增强，早期使用文本和轮廓引导建立整体结构，后期激活细粒度分类器引导并动态调整强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准文本引导方法在细粒度任务中缺乏特异性，可能生成误导性样本，影响分类器性能。需要确保合成图像准确捕捉类别定义的细微特征。

Method: HiGFA利用扩散采样过程的时间动态：早期使用固定强度的文本和轮廓引导建立场景、风格和结构；后期激活细粒度分类器引导，并基于预测置信度动态调制所有引导信号的强度。

Result: 在多个细粒度视觉分类数据集上的实验证明了HiGFA的有效性。

Conclusion: HiGFA通过分层、置信度驱动的协调机制，能够生成多样化且忠实的合成图像，在全局结构形成和精确细节细化之间实现智能平衡。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models show promise for data augmentation. However, applying them to fine-grained tasks presents a significant challenge: ensuring synthetic images accurately capture the subtle, category-defining features critical for high fidelity. Standard approaches, such as text-based Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), often lack the required specificity, potentially generating misleading examples that degrade fine-grained classifier performance. To address this, we propose Hierarchically Guided Fine-grained Augmentation (HiGFA). HiGFA leverages the temporal dynamics of the diffusion sampling process. It employs strong text and transformed contour guidance with fixed strengths in the early-to-mid sampling stages to establish overall scene, style, and structure. In the final sampling stages, HiGFA activates a specialized fine-grained classifier guidance and dynamically modulates the strength of all guidance signals based on prediction confidence. This hierarchical, confidence-driven orchestration enables HiGFA to generate diverse yet faithful synthetic images by intelligently balancing global structure formation with precise detail refinement. Experiments on several FGVC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGFA.

### [128] [EmoVerse: A MLLMs-Driven Emotion Representation Dataset for Interpretable Visual Emotion Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12554)
*Yijie Guo,Dexiang Hong,Weidong Chen,Zihan She,Cheng Ye,Xiaojun Chang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoVerse是一个大规模开源数据集，通过多层次的基于知识图谱的注释实现可解释的视觉情感分析，包含超过219K图像，支持离散和连续情感表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉情感分析领域因缺乏开源和可解释数据集而进展有限，现有研究通常为整张图像分配单一离散情感标签，无法揭示视觉元素如何贡献情感。

Method: 通过将情感分解为背景-属性-主体三元组并将每个元素定位到视觉区域，构建多阶段标注流程确保高可靠性，并开发可解释模型将视觉线索映射到维度情感空间表示。

Result: 创建了包含219K+图像的EmoVerse数据集，提供词级和主体级情感推理，支持分类情感状态和维度情感空间的双重标注。

Conclusion: EmoVerse数据集、标注流程和模型共同构成了推进可解释高级情感理解的综合基础。

Abstract: Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) aims to bridge the affective gap between visual content and human emotional responses. Despite its promise, progress in this field remains limited by the lack of open-source and interpretable datasets. Most existing studies assign a single discrete emotion label to an entire image, offering limited insight into how visual elements contribute to emotion. In this work, we introduce EmoVerse, a large-scale open-source dataset that enables interpretable visual emotion analysis through multi-layered, knowledge-graph-inspired annotations. By decomposing emotions into Background-Attribute-Subject (B-A-S) triplets and grounding each element to visual regions, EmoVerse provides word-level and subject-level emotional reasoning. With over 219k images, the dataset further includes dual annotations in Categorical Emotion States (CES) and Dimensional Emotion Space (DES), facilitating unified discrete and continuous emotion representation. A novel multi-stage pipeline ensures high annotation reliability with minimal human effort. Finally, we introduce an interpretable model that maps visual cues into DES representations and provides detailed attribution explanations. Together, the dataset, pipeline, and model form a comprehensive foundation for advancing explainable high-level emotion understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能有效利用浅层结构信息，且难以通过图像增强生成的对比样本捕获细粒度语义差异，导致超声标准平面识别效果不佳

Method: 提出SEMC框架：1）语义结构融合模块(SSFM)利用多尺度结构信息，对齐浅层和深层特征；2）专家混合对比识别模块(MCRM)使用MoE机制进行分层对比学习和分类

Result: 在内部数据集和两个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，SEMC在各种指标上均优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: SEMC框架通过结构增强和专家混合对比学习，有效提升了超声标准平面识别的性能

Abstract: Ultrasound standard plane recognition is essential for clinical tasks such as disease screening, organ evaluation, and biometric measurement. However, existing methods fail to effectively exploit shallow structural information and struggle to capture fine-grained semantic differences through contrastive samples generated by image augmentations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal recognition of both structural and discriminative details in ultrasound standard planes. To address these issues, we propose SEMC, a novel Structure-Enhanced Mixture-of-Experts Contrastive learning framework that combines structure-aware feature fusion with expert-guided contrastive learning. Specifically, we first introduce a novel Semantic-Structure Fusion Module (SSFM) to exploit multi-scale structural information and enhance the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structural details by effectively aligning shallow and deep features. Then, a novel Mixture-of-Experts Contrastive Recognition Module (MCRM) is designed to perform hierarchical contrastive learning and classification across multi-level features using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism, further improving class separability and recognition performance. More importantly, we also curate a large-scale and meticulously annotated liver ultrasound dataset containing six standard planes. Extensive experimental results on our in-house dataset and two public datasets demonstrate that SEMC outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.

*Mohamed Youssef,Lukas Brunner,Klaus Rundhammer,Gerald Czech,Oliver Bimber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合信号处理和机器学习的新方法，通过遮挡的森林植被重建地表温度，用于无人机自动监测野火。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现无人机自动监测野火，在地面火灾产生可见烟雾或火焰之前进行早期检测。合成孔径感知虽然能减轻树冠和阳光的遮挡，但会引入热模糊，掩盖实际地表温度。

Method: 训练视觉状态空间模型从模糊数据中恢复被部分遮挡的土壤和火灾热点的细微热信号。由于真实训练数据稀缺，使用潜在扩散模型结合矢量量化生成大量真实的地表温度模拟数据，并通过温度增强和程序化热森林模拟进一步扩展。

Result: 在模拟数据上，相比传统热成像和未校正的SA成像，RMSE降低了2到2.5倍。在野外实验中，对高温热点的改进更为显著，RMSE比传统热成像提高了12.8倍，比未校正SA图像提高了2.6倍。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能重建火灾和人体特征的完整形态特征，还能推广到其他热信号应用，如搜救中的人体特征检测，而传统成像方法在部分遮挡情况下会失效。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for reconstructing surface temperatures through occluding forest vegetation by combining signal processing and machine learning. Our goal is to enable fully automated aerial wildfire monitoring using autonomous drones, allowing for the early detection of ground fires before smoke or flames are visible. While synthetic aperture (SA) sensing mitigates occlusion from the canopy and sunlight, it introduces thermal blur that obscures the actual surface temperatures. To address this, we train a visual state space model to recover the subtle thermal signals of partially occluded soil and fire hotspots from this blurred data. A key challenge was the scarcity of real-world training data. We overcome this by integrating a latent diffusion model into a vector quantized to generated a large volume of realistic surface temperature simulations from real wildfire recordings, which we further expanded through temperature augmentation and procedural thermal forest simulation. On simulated data across varied ambient and surface temperatures, forest densities, and sunlight conditions, our method reduced the RMSE by a factor of 2 to 2.5 compared to conventional thermal and uncorrected SA imaging. In field experiments focused on high-temperature hotspots, the improvement was even more significant, with a 12.8-fold RMSE gain over conventional thermal and a 2.6-fold gain over uncorrected SA images. We also demonstrate our model's generalization to other thermal signals, such as human signatures for search and rescue. Since simple thresholding is frequently inadequate for detecting subtle thermal signals, the morphological characteristics are equally essential for accurate classification. Our experiments demonstrated another clear advantage: we reconstructed the complete morphology of fire and human signatures, whereas conventional imaging is defeated by partial occlusion.

*Jiayi Zhu,Yihao Huang,Yue Cao,Xiaojun Jia,Qing Guo,Felix Juefei-Xu,Geguang Pu,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本攻击的地理隐私保护方法，通过在图像外部添加欺骗性文本，有效降低大型视觉语言模型的地理位置推断准确率，同时保持图像视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型能够从社交媒体图像中推断用户地理位置，造成严重的隐私泄露威胁。现有的对抗性图像扰动方法需要强失真，会显著降低图像视觉质量。

Method: 采用两阶段语义感知的文本攻击方法，在图像视觉内容外部添加欺骗性文本，通过语义干扰来破坏地理位置推断。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了五个最先进商业LVLMs的地理位置预测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为对抗新兴地理隐私威胁提供了一种实用且视觉保持的保护策略。

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) now pose a serious yet overlooked privacy threat, as they can infer a social media user's geolocation directly from shared images, leading to unintended privacy leakage. While adversarial image perturbations provide a potential direction for geo-privacy protection, they require relatively strong distortions to be effective against LVLMs, which noticeably degrade visual quality and diminish an image's value for sharing. To overcome this limitation, we identify typographical attacks as a promising direction for protecting geo-privacy by adding text extension outside the visual content. We further investigate which textual semantics are effective in disrupting geolocation inference and design a two-stage, semantics-aware typographical attack that generates deceptive text to protect user privacy. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces geolocation prediction accuracy of five state-of-the-art commercial LVLMs, establishing a practical and visually-preserving protection strategy against emerging geo-privacy threats.

Motivation: 解决长视频生成中的长程时序一致性问题，同时保持生成效率。

Method: 首先生成低帧率视频作为粗粒度蓝图，然后逐步提高帧率来细化视觉细节和运动连续性；在每帧率级别使用双向注意力，在帧率间进行自回归。

Result: 在长视频生成任务中建立了新的最先进水平，在视觉质量和时序质量方面表现出色。

Conclusion: TempoMaster通过帧率渐进式生成策略，成功实现了长视频的高质量高效生成。

Abstract: We present TempoMaster, a novel framework that formulates long video generation as next-frame-rate prediction. Specifically, we first generate a low-frame-rate clip that serves as a coarse blueprint of the entire video sequence, and then progressively increase the frame rate to refine visual details and motion continuity. During generation, TempoMaster employs bidirectional attention within each frame-rate level while performing autoregression across frame rates, thus achieving long-range temporal coherence while enabling efficient and parallel synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoMaster establishes a new state-of-the-art in long video generation, excelling in both visual and temporal quality.

Motivation: 免疫组化图像中的细胞计数对癌症诊断至关重要，但面临染色重叠、形态多样等挑战。现有回归方法很少支持端到端多类计数，且基础模型潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 1. 排名感知教师选择策略(RATS)评估教师模型的计数能力；2. 多模态微调阶段，使用结构化文本提示编码类别和数量信息；3. 回归类别特异性密度图处理重叠细胞。

Result: 在12种生物标志物和5种组织类型上超越最先进方法，与病理学家评估高度一致，在H&E染色数据上也验证了方法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: CountIHC通过知识蒸馏和多模态学习有效解决了免疫组化图像中的多类细胞计数问题，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate cell counting in immunohistochemistry (IHC) images is critical for quantifying protein expression and aiding cancer diagnosis. However, the task remains challenging due to the chromogen overlap, variable biomarker staining, and diverse cellular morphologies. Regression-based counting methods offer advantages over detection-based ones in handling overlapped cells, yet rarely support end-to-end multi-class counting. Moreover, the potential of foundation models remains largely underexplored in this paradigm. To address these limitations, we propose a rank-aware agglomeration framework that selectively distills knowledge from multiple strong foundation models, leveraging their complementary representations to handle IHC heterogeneity and obtain a compact yet effective student model, CountIHC. Unlike prior task-agnostic agglomeration strategies that either treat all teachers equally or rely on feature similarity, we design a Rank-Aware Teacher Selecting (RATS) strategy that models global-to-local patch rankings to assess each teacher's inherent counting capacity and enable sample-wise teacher selection. For multi-class cell counting, we introduce a fine-tuning stage that reformulates the task as vision-language alignment. Discrete semantic anchors derived from structured text prompts encode both category and quantity information, guiding the regression of class-specific density maps and improving counting for overlapping cells. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CountIHC surpasses state-of-the-art methods across 12 IHC biomarkers and 5 tissue types, while exhibiting high agreement with pathologists' assessments. Its effectiveness on H&E-stained data further confirms the scalability of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出了TopoFG框架，通过细粒度查询和边界点拓扑推理来精确建模复杂车道结构，在OpenLane-V2基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用单个查询表示每条车道，基于查询相似性推断拓扑连接，难以准确建模复杂车道结构，导致拓扑预测不可靠。

Method: TopoFG框架包含三个模块：分层先验提取器（HPE）从BEV掩码和车道关键点序列提取空间和序列先验；区域聚焦解码器（RFD）构建细粒度查询并采样参考点；鲁棒边界点拓扑推理（RBTR）基于边界点特征建模车道连接性并采用拓扑去噪策略。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2基准测试中，TopoFG在subsetA上达到48.0% OLS，在subsetB上达到45.4% OLS，创造了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过将空间和序列先验集成到细粒度查询中，并对边界点拓扑推理应用去噪策略，该方法能够精确建模复杂车道结构并提供可信的拓扑预测。

Abstract: Precise modeling of lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, as it directly impacts navigation and control decisions.Existing methods typically represent each lane with a single query and infer topological connectivity based on the similarity between lane queries.However, this kind of design struggles to accurately model complex lane structures, leading to unreliable topology prediction.In this view, we propose a Fine-Grained lane topology reasoning framework (TopoFG).It divides the procedure from bird's-eye-view (BEV) features to topology prediction via fine-grained queries into three phases, i.e., Hierarchical Prior Extractor (HPE), Region-Focused Decoder (RFD), and Robust Boundary-Point Topology Reasoning (RBTR).Specifically, HPE extracts global spatial priors from the BEV mask and local sequential priors from in-lane keypoint sequences to guide subsequent fine-grained query modeling.RFD constructs fine-grained queries by integrating the spatial and sequential priors. It then samples reference points in RoI regions of the mask and applies cross-attention with BEV features to refine the query representations of each lane.RBTR models lane connectivity based on boundary-point query features and further employs a topological denoising strategy to reduce matching ambiguity.By integrating spatial and sequential priors into fine-grained queries and applying a denoising strategy to boundary-point topology reasoning, our method precisely models complex lane structures and delivers trustworthy topology predictions.Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that TopoFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with an OLS of 48.0% on subsetA and 45.4% on subsetB.

Result: 实验表明Seg-VAR在各种分割任务和验证基准上优于之前的判别性和生成性方法。

Conclusion: 通过将分割构建为序列层次预测任务，Seg-VAR为将自回归推理集成到空间感知视觉系统中开辟了新途径。

Abstract: While visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) strategies have shed light on image generation with the autoregressive models, their potential for segmentation, a task that requires precise low-level spatial perception, remains unexplored. Inspired by the multi-scale modeling of classic Mask2Former-based models, we propose Seg-VAR, a novel framework that rethinks segmentation as a conditional autoregressive mask generation problem. This is achieved by replacing the discriminative learning with the latent learning process. Specifically, our method incorporates three core components: (1) an image encoder generating latent priors from input images, (2) a spatial-aware seglat (a latent expression of segmentation mask) encoder that maps segmentation masks into discrete latent tokens using a location-sensitive color mapping to distinguish instances, and (3) a decoder reconstructing masks from these latents. A multi-stage training strategy is introduced: first learning seglat representations via image-seglat joint training, then refining latent transformations, and finally aligning image-encoder-derived latents with seglat distributions. Experiments show Seg-VAR outperforms previous discriminative and generative methods on various segmentation tasks and validation benchmarks. By framing segmentation as a sequential hierarchical prediction task, Seg-VAR opens new avenues for integrating autoregressive reasoning into spatial-aware vision systems. Code will be available at https://github.com/rkzheng99/Seg-VAR.

Abstract: Face Recognition Systems (FRS) are critical for security but remain vulnerable to morphing attacks, where synthetic images blend biometric features from multiple individuals. We propose a novel Single-Image Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD) approach using a teacher-student framework, where a CNN-based teacher model refines a ViT-based student model. To improve efficiency, we integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning, reducing computational costs while maintaining high detection accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted on a morphing dataset built from three publicly available face datasets, incorporating ten different morphing generation algorithms to assess robustness. The proposed method is benchmarked against six state-of-the-art S-MAD techniques, demonstrating superior detection performance and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏标准化的基准来对齐广播视频和追踪数据以进行群体活动识别，无法公平比较这两种模态的性能。

Method: 构建了SoccerNet-GAR多模态数据集，包含94,285个同步标注的群体活动；提出了基于视频的分类器和基于追踪的图神经网络分类器，特别是引入了角色感知图架构来编码战术结构。

Result: 追踪模型达到67.2%的平衡准确率，比最佳视频基线（58.1%）高出9.1个百分点，同时训练速度快4.25倍，参数少438倍（197K vs 86.3M）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了像素和位置在群体活动识别中的相对优势，强调了模态选择和角色感知建模的重要性。

Abstract: Group Activity Recognition (GAR) is well studied on the video modality for surveillance and indoor team sports (e.g., volleyball, basketball). Yet, other modalities such as agent positions and trajectories over time, i.e. tracking, remain comparatively under-explored despite being compact, agent-centric signals that explicitly encode spatial interactions. Understanding whether pixel (video) or position (tracking) modalities leads to better group activity recognition is therefore important to drive further research on the topic. However, no standardized benchmark currently exists that aligns broadcast video and tracking data for the same group activities, leading to a lack of apples-to-apples comparison between these modalities for GAR. In this work, we introduce SoccerNet-GAR, a multimodal dataset built from the $64$ matches of the football World Cup 2022. Specifically, the broadcast videos and player tracking modalities for $94{,}285$ group activities are synchronized and annotated with $10$ categories. Furthermore, we define a unified evaluation protocol to benchmark two strong unimodal approaches: (i) a competitive video-based classifiers and (ii) a tracking-based classifiers leveraging graph neural networks. In particular, our novel role-aware graph architecture for tracking-based GAR directly encodes tactical structure through positional edges and temporal attention. Our tracking model achieves $67.2\%$ balanced accuracy compared to $58.1\%$ for the best video baseline, while training $4.25 \times$ faster with $438 \times$ fewer parameters ($197K$ \vs $86.3M$). This study provides new insights into the relative strengths of pixels and positions for group activity recognition. Overall, it highlights the importance of modality choice and role-aware modeling for GAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实场景中，模型经常遇到分布外样本，将其误分类为已知类别不仅降低预测准确性，还会损害适应过程。现有TTA方法在此条件下性能显著下降。

Method: 使用分层阶梯网络从所有Transformer层聚合的类别标记中提取OOD特征，通过加权概率融合增强OOD检测；引入注意力仿射网络自适应优化自注意力机制；采用加权熵机制动态抑制低置信度样本的影响。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在广泛使用的分类数据集上显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效提升了模型在测试时适应过程中对分布外样本和领域偏移的鲁棒性，显著改善了分类性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adjusting the model during the testing phase to cope with changes in sample distribution and enhance the model's adaptability to new environments. In real-world scenarios, models often encounter samples from unseen (out-of-distribution, OOD) categories. Misclassifying these as known (in-distribution, ID) classes not only degrades predictive accuracy but can also impair the adaptation process, leading to further errors on subsequent ID samples. Many existing TTA methods suffer substantial performance drops under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Ladder Network that extracts OOD features from class tokens aggregated across all Transformer layers. OOD detection performance is enhanced by combining the original model prediction with the output of the Hierarchical Ladder Network (HLN) via weighted probability fusion. To improve robustness under domain shift, we further introduce an Attention Affine Network (AAN) that adaptively refines the self-attention mechanism conditioned on the token information to better adapt to domain drift, thereby improving the classification performance of the model on datasets with domain shift. Additionally, a weighted entropy mechanism is employed to dynamically suppress the influence of low-confidence samples during adaptation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly improves the performance on the most widely used classification datasets.

Motivation: 解决传统方法中物体检测和姿态估计分离的问题，提供既能处理有CAD模型场景又能处理无模型场景的统一解决方案。

Method: 使用CNOS检测器定位目标物体，然后通过基于transformer的OPFormer姿态估计模块推断6D姿态，该模块结合多视角模板视图和NOCS几何先验来建立2D-3D对应关系。

Result: 在BOP基准测试中展现出良好的精度和效率平衡，证明了在模型驱动和无模型场景中的实际适用性。

Conclusion: 该集成系统提供了一个实用且灵活的解决方案，能够在不同场景下实现准确的物体检测和姿态估计。

Abstract: We introduce a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates object detection and pose estimation with a versatile onboarding process. Our pipeline begins with an onboarding stage that generates object representations from either traditional 3D CAD models or, in their absence, by rapidly reconstructing a high-fidelity neural representation (NeRF) from multi-view images. Given a test image, our system first employs the CNOS detector to localize target objects. For each detection, our novel pose estimation module, OPFormer, infers the precise 6D pose. The core of OPFormer is a transformer-based architecture that leverages a foundation model for robust feature extraction. It uniquely learns a comprehensive object representation by jointly encoding multiple template views and enriches these features with explicit 3D geometric priors using Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS). A decoder then establishes robust 2D-3D correspondences to determine the final pose. Evaluated on the challenging BOP benchmarks, our integrated system demonstrates a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency, showcasing its practical applicability in both model-based and model-free scenarios.

TL;DR: C3Net是一个专门用于伪装目标检测的双路径解码器架构，通过边缘精炼路径和上下文定位路径协同工作，解决了伪装目标检测中的六个核心挑战，在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪装目标检测面临传统分割方法和现代基础模型都无法有效处理的挑战，因为伪装物体与背景在颜色、纹理和模式上高度相似。论文识别了六个基本挑战：内在相似性、边缘破坏、极端尺度变化、环境复杂性、上下文依赖性和显著-伪装目标区分。

Method: 提出C3Net双路径解码器架构：边缘精炼路径使用梯度初始化边缘增强模块从早期特征恢复精确边界；上下文定位路径采用基于图像的上下文引导机制实现内在显著性抑制；注意力融合模块通过空间门控协同结合两个路径。

Result: 在COD10K数据集上S-measure达到0.898，CAMO数据集达到0.904，NC4K数据集达到0.913，均达到最先进性能，同时保持高效处理。

Conclusion: C3Net表明复杂多方面的检测挑战需要架构创新，通过专门组件协同工作实现全面覆盖，超越了孤立改进的效果。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection identifies objects that blend seamlessly with their surroundings through similar colors, textures, and patterns. This task challenges both traditional segmentation methods and modern foundation models, which fail dramatically on camouflaged objects. We identify six fundamental challenges in COD: Intrinsic Similarity, Edge Disruption, Extreme Scale Variation, Environmental Complexities, Contextual Dependencies, and Salient-Camouflaged Object Disambiguation. These challenges frequently co-occur and compound the difficulty of detection, requiring comprehensive architectural solutions. We propose C3Net, which addresses all challenges through a specialized dual-pathway decoder architecture. The Edge Refinement Pathway employs gradient-initialized Edge Enhancement Modules to recover precise boundaries from early features. The Contextual Localization Pathway utilizes our novel Image-based Context Guidance mechanism to achieve intrinsic saliency suppression without external models. An Attentive Fusion Module synergistically combines the two pathways via spatial gating. C3Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with S-measures of 0.898 on COD10K, 0.904 on CAMO, and 0.913 on NC4K, while maintaining efficient processing. C3Net demonstrates that complex, multifaceted detection challenges require architectural innovation, with specialized components working synergistically to achieve comprehensive coverage beyond isolated improvements.

TL;DR: MDiTFace是一个基于扩散变换器的多模态人脸生成框架，通过统一的标记化策略处理语义掩码和文本输入，采用解耦注意力机制显著降低计算开销，在面部保真度和条件一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MDiTFace通过统一的标记化策略和解耦注意力机制，有效解决了多模态人脸生成中的跨模态交互问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: While significant progress has been achieved in multimodal facial generation using semantic masks and textual descriptions, conventional feature fusion approaches often fail to enable effective cross-modal interactions, thereby leading to suboptimal generation outcomes. To address this challenge, we introduce MDiTFace--a customized diffusion transformer framework that employs a unified tokenization strategy to process semantic mask and text inputs, eliminating discrepancies between heterogeneous modality representations. The framework facilitates comprehensive multimodal feature interaction through stacked, newly designed multivariate transformer blocks that process all conditions synchronously. Additionally, we design a novel decoupled attention mechanism by dissociating implicit dependencies between mask tokens and temporal embeddings. This mechanism segregates internal computations into dynamic and static pathways, enabling caching and reuse of features computed in static pathways after initial calculation, thereby reducing additional computational overhead introduced by mask condition by over 94% while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDiTFace significantly outperforms other competing methods in terms of both facial fidelity and conditional consistency.

TL;DR: 提出Denoising-VAE，通过谱自正则化策略抑制高维潜在空间中的冗余高频噪声，在保持重建质量的同时提升生成质量和优化收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE在高维潜在空间中存在优化困境：高维空间能提高重建保真度但损害生成性能。现有方法依赖外部视觉基础模型进行正则化，但高维潜在如何影响生成模型优化仍不清楚。

Method: 提出谱自正则化策略来抑制冗余高频噪声，同时保持重建质量；引入谱对齐策略促进基于Denoising-VAE的生成模型优化。使用ViT-based自编码器，不依赖VFMs。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256基准上，扩散模型收敛速度比SD-VAE快约2倍，达到最先进的重建质量（rFID=0.28，PSNR=27.26）和竞争性生成性能（gFID=1.82）。

Conclusion: Denoising-VAE通过抑制高维潜在空间中的冗余高频噪声，有效解决了VAE的优化困境，在保持优秀重建质量的同时显著提升了生成性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) typically encode images into a compact latent space, reducing computational cost but introducing an optimization dilemma: a higher-dimensional latent space improves reconstruction fidelity but often hampers generative performance. Recent methods attempt to address this dilemma by regularizing high-dimensional latent spaces using external vision foundation models (VFMs). However, it remains unclear how high-dimensional VAE latents affect the optimization of generative models. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to reveal that redundant high-frequency components in high-dimensional latent spaces hinder the training convergence of diffusion models and, consequently, degrade generation quality. To alleviate this problem, we propose a spectral self-regularization strategy to suppress redundant high-frequency noise while simultaneously preserving reconstruction quality. The resulting Denoising-VAE, a ViT-based autoencoder that does not rely on VFMs, produces cleaner, lower-noise latents, leading to improved generative quality and faster optimization convergence. We further introduce a spectral alignment strategy to facilitate the optimization of Denoising-VAE-based generative models. Our complete method enables diffusion models to converge approximately 2$\times$ faster than with SD-VAE, while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality (rFID = 0.28, PSNR = 27.26) and competitive generation performance (gFID = 1.82) on the ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark.

TL;DR: CILMP是一种将大型语言模型(LLMs)集成到视觉语言模型(VLMs)提示调优中的方法，通过提取疾病特定表示并利用条件干预机制生成实例自适应提示，在医学图像分类任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示调优方法无法准确区分不同类型的医学概念，缺乏跨医学成像模态的疾病相关特征。大型语言模型在提供专业医学知识方面表现出色，因此考虑将其集成到提示调优过程中。

Method: 提出CILMP方法：从LLMs提取疾病特定表示，在低秩线性子空间中进行干预，利用这些表示创建疾病特定提示。加入条件机制，根据每个医学图像调整干预过程，生成实例自适应提示。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的广泛实验表明，CILMP始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: CILMP成功地将LLMs的医学知识转移到VLM提示中，通过条件干预机制生成实例自适应提示，在医学图像分类任务中实现了卓越性能，同时减少了资源消耗。

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs) have shown great potential in feature transfer and generalization across a wide spectrum of medical-related downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning these models is resource-intensive due to their large number of parameters. Prompt tuning has emerged as a viable solution to mitigate memory usage and reduce training time while maintaining competitive performance. Nevertheless, the challenge is that existing prompt tuning methods cannot precisely distinguish different kinds of medical concepts, which miss essentially specific disease-related features across various medical imaging modalities in medical image classification tasks. We find that Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora, are particularly adept at providing this specialized medical knowledge. Motivated by this, we propose incorporating LLMs into the prompt tuning process. Specifically, we introduce the CILMP, Conditional Intervention of Large Language Models for Prompt Tuning, a method that bridges LLMs and VLMs to facilitate the transfer of medical knowledge into VLM prompts. CILMP extracts disease-specific representations from LLMs, intervenes within a low-rank linear subspace, and utilizes them to create disease-specific prompts. Additionally, a conditional mechanism is incorporated to condition the intervention process on each individual medical image, generating instance-adaptive prompts and thus enhancing adaptability. Extensive experiments across diverse medical image datasets demonstrate that CILMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: DPVO-QAT++有效弥合了高精度深度VO与实际部署效率要求之间的差距，为在现实世界嵌入式平台上应用该技术提供了可行的工程范式。

Abstract: Deep learning-based Visual SLAM (vSLAM) systems exhibit exceptional geometric reasoning capabilities, yet their prohibitive computational overhead severely restricts deployment on resource-constrained autonomous platforms. This paper presents a hierarchical quantization optimization framework, DPVO-QAT++ (DPVO-QAT++: Heterogeneous QAT and CUDA Kernel Fusion for High-Performance Deep Patch Visual Odometry). Through the synergistic integration of learnable scale parameterization, a heterogeneous precision design for the Visual Odometry (VO) front-end and back-end (front-end floating-point fake quantization with FP16/FP32; back-end full precision), and GPU-native kernel fusion for fake quantization (custom CUDA kernels), our framework significantly reduces memory footprint and increases processing speed while preserving the trajectory accuracy of the original model. On the TartanAir dataset, our framework achieves an average FPS increase of 52.1%, a 29.1% reduction in median latency, and a 64.9% reduction in peak GPU memory reservation, while maintaining trajectory accuracy (ATE) comparable to the original DPVO model across 32 validation sequences. On the EuRoC dataset, it realizes an average FPS increase of 30.1%, a 23.1% reduction in median latency, and a 37.7% reduction in peak GPU memory reservation, maintaining comparable trajectory accuracy (ATE) across 11 validation sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that DPVO-QAT++ effectively bridges the gap between high-precision deep VO and the efficiency requirements for practical deployment, offering a viable engineering paradigm for the application of this technology on real-world embedded platforms.

Conclusion: FSTS框架通过结构化建模真实篡改行为，能够生成更符合现实情况的训练数据，有效提升文本图像伪造定位方法的泛化能力

Abstract: Existing Text Image Forgery Localization (T-IFL) methods often suffer from poor generalization due to the limited scale of real-world datasets and the distribution gap caused by synthetic data that fails to capture the complexity of real-world tampering. To tackle this issue, we propose Fourier Series-based Tampering Synthesis (FSTS), a structured and interpretable framework for synthesizing tampered text images. FSTS first collects 16,750 real-world tampering instances from five representative tampering types, using a structured pipeline that records human-performed editing traces via multi-format logs (e.g., video, PSD, and editing logs). By analyzing these collected parameters and identifying recurring behavioral patterns at both individual and population levels, we formulate a hierarchical modeling framework. Specifically, each individual tampering parameter is represented as a compact combination of basis operation-parameter configurations, while the population-level distribution is constructed by aggregating these behaviors. Since this formulation draws inspiration from the Fourier series, it enables an interpretable approximation using basis functions and their learned weights. By sampling from this modeled distribution, FSTS synthesizes diverse and realistic training data that better reflect real-world forgery traces. Extensive experiments across four evaluation protocols demonstrate that models trained with FSTS data achieve significantly improved generalization on real-world datasets.

Abstract: The goal of Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is to generate realistic images of a given content from unseen viewpoints. But how can we trust that a generated image truly reflects the intended transformation? Evaluating its reliability remains a major challenge. While recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based approaches, have significantly improved NVS quality, existing evaluation metrics struggle to assess whether a generated image is both realistic and faithful to the source view and intended viewpoint transformation. Standard metrics, such as pixel-wise similarity and distribution-based measures, often mis-rank incorrect results as they fail to capture the nuanced relationship between the source image, viewpoint change, and generated output. We propose a task-aware evaluation framework that leverages features from a strong NVS foundation model, Zero123, combined with a lightweight tuning step to enhance discrimination. Using these features, we introduce two complementary evaluation metrics: a reference-based score, $D_{\text{PRISM}}$, and a reference-free score, $\text{MMD}_{\text{PRISM}}$. Both reliably identify incorrect generations and rank models in agreement with human preference studies, addressing a fundamental gap in NVS evaluation. Our framework provides a principled and practical approach to assessing synthesis quality, paving the way for more reliable progress in novel view synthesis. To further support this goal, we apply our reference-free metric to six NVS methods across three benchmarks: Toys4K, Google Scanned Objects (GSO), and OmniObject3D, where $\text{MMD}_{\text{PRISM}}$ produces a clear and stable ranking, with lower scores consistently indicating stronger models.

Abstract: Deploying embodied agents that can answer questions about their surroundings in realistic real-world settings remains difficult, partly due to the scarcity of benchmarks that faithfully capture practical operating conditions. We propose infrastructure inspection as a compelling domain for open-vocabulary Embodied Question Answering (EQA): it naturally demands multi-scale reasoning, long-range spatial understanding, and complex semantic relationships, while offering unique evaluation advantages via standardized National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition ratings (0-9), professional inspection reports, and egocentric imagery.
  We introduce BridgeEQA, a benchmark of 2,200 open-vocabulary question-answer pairs (in the style of OpenEQA) grounded in professional inspection reports across 200 real-world bridge scenes with 47.93 images on average per scene. Questions require synthesizing visual evidence across multiple images and aligning responses with NBI condition ratings. We further propose a new EQA metric Image Citation Relevance to evaluate the ability of a model to cite relevant images.
  Evaluations of state-of-the-art vision-language models reveal substantial performance gaps under episodic memory EQA settings. To address this, we propose Embodied Memory Visual Reasoning (EMVR), which formulates inspection as sequential navigation over an image-based scene graph: images are nodes, and an agent takes actions to traverse views, compare evidence, and reason within a Markov decision process. EMVR shows strong performance over the baselines. We publicly release both the dataset and code.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation struggle under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, often producing fragmented false positives on OOD tumors. We introduce R$^{2}$Seg, a training-free framework for robust OOD tumor segmentation that operates via a two-stage Reason-and-Reject process. First, the Reason step employs an LLM-guided anatomical reasoning planner to localize organ anchors and generate multi-scale ROIs. Second, the Reject step applies two-sample statistical testing to candidates generated by a frozen foundation model (BiomedParse) within these ROIs. This statistical rejection filter retains only candidates significantly different from normal tissue, effectively suppressing false positives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HEDGE是一个统一的幻觉检测框架，通过视觉扰动、语义聚类和不确定性度量来检测视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，在多个模型和数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在开放域视觉问答中容易产生幻觉，需要系统性的检测方法来评估多模态可靠性。

Method: 结合受控视觉扰动、语义聚类（蕴含和嵌入两种方法）和鲁棒不确定性度量，构建可复现的检测流程。

Result: 评估显示：统一融合模型（如Qwen2.5-VL）检测效果最好，受限标记化模型（如Med-Gemma）最差；嵌入聚类在生成答案上效果更好，NLI聚类在长句回答中更优；VASE度量提供最鲁棒的幻觉信号。

Conclusion: HEDGE将幻觉检测构建为几何鲁棒性问题，为评估多模态可靠性提供了原则性、计算感知的基础框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) enable open-ended visual question answering but remain prone to hallucinations. We present HEDGE, a unified framework for hallucination detection that combines controlled visual perturbations, semantic clustering, and robust uncertainty metrics. HEDGE integrates sampling, distortion synthesis, clustering (entailment- and embedding-based), and metric computation into a reproducible pipeline applicable across multimodal architectures.
  Evaluations on VQA-RAD and KvasirVQA-x1 with three representative VLMs (LLaVA-Med, Med-Gemma, Qwen2.5-VL) reveal clear architecture- and prompt-dependent trends. Hallucination detectability is highest for unified-fusion models with dense visual tokenization (Qwen2.5-VL) and lowest for architectures with restricted tokenization (Med-Gemma). Embedding-based clustering often yields stronger separation when applied directly to the generated answers, whereas NLI-based clustering remains advantageous for LLaVA-Med and for longer, sentence-level responses. Across configurations, the VASE metric consistently provides the most robust hallucination signal, especially when paired with embedding clustering and a moderate sampling budget (n ~ 10-15). Prompt design also matters: concise, label-style outputs offer clearer semantic structure than syntactically constrained one-sentence responses.
  By framing hallucination detection as a geometric robustness problem shaped jointly by sampling scale, prompt structure, model architecture, and clustering strategy, HEDGE provides a principled, compute-aware foundation for evaluating multimodal reliability. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE .

*Mohamed A. Mabrok,Yalda Zafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于可控性的可解释性框架，用于理解视觉状态空间模型（SSMs）如何处理空间信息，通过量化输入序列不同部分对内部状态动态的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管状态空间模型（特别是Mamba架构）在序列建模中表现出色，但由于缺乏类似注意力的透明机制，理解它们如何处理空间信息仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了两种互补的方法：适用于任何SSM架构的基于雅可比的方法，通过完整的状态传播链测量影响；以及针对对角SSMs的基于格拉姆的方法，通过闭式解析解实现更快的速度。两种方法都在单次前向传播中运行，具有线性复杂度。

Result: 在三种不同的医学成像模态上的实验表明，SSMs自然地实现了从早期层的扩散低层次纹理到更深层聚焦的临床有意义模式的分层特征细化。分析揭示了与诊断标准一致的领域特定可控性特征、跨网络层次结构的渐进空间选择性，以及扫描策略对注意力模式的显著影响。

Conclusion: 该框架确立了可控性分析作为跨所有领域的SSMs的统一、基础可解释性范式，并展示了在计算机视觉、自然语言处理和跨领域任务中的广泛应用。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have recently emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear computational complexity while achieving competitive performance. Yet, despite their effectiveness, understanding how these Vision SSMs process spatial information remains challenging due to the lack of transparent, attention-like mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a controllability-based interpretability framework that quantifies how different parts of the input sequence (tokens or patches) influence the internal state dynamics of SSMs. We propose two complementary formulations: a Jacobian-based method applicable to any SSM architecture that measures influence through the full chain of state propagation, and a Gramian-based approach for diagonal SSMs that achieves superior speed through closed-form analytical solutions. Both methods operate in a single forward pass with linear complexity, requiring no architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. We validate our framework through experiments on three diverse medical imaging modalities, demonstrating that SSMs naturally implement hierarchical feature refinement from diffuse low-level textures in early layers to focused, clinically meaningful patterns in deeper layers. Our analysis reveals domain-specific controllability signatures aligned with diagnostic criteria, progressive spatial selectivity across the network hierarchy, and the substantial influence of scanning strategies on attention patterns. Beyond medical imaging, we articulate applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-domain tasks. Our framework establishes controllability analysis as a unified, foundational interpretability paradigm for SSMs across all domains. Code and analysis tools will be made available upon publication

TL;DR: CountOCC是一个针对遮挡场景的物体计数框架，通过多模态引导显式重建被遮挡物体的特征，在遮挡条件下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物体计数方法在遮挡场景下表现不佳，因为主干网络编码的是遮挡表面而非目标物体，导致特征表示被破坏。

Method: 使用分层多模态引导显式重建被遮挡物体特征，整合可见片段的空间上下文与文本和视觉嵌入的语义先验，在多个金字塔层级生成类别区分性特征，并引入视觉等价目标确保遮挡和非遮挡视图产生空间对齐的注意力图。

Result: 在FSC 147数据集上，验证集和测试集的MAE分别降低26.72%和20.80%；在CARPK数据集上MAE降低49.89%；在CAPTUREReal数据集上MAE降低28.79%。

Conclusion: CountOCC通过互补机制在遮挡条件下保持区分性特征，实现了跨多个视觉领域的鲁棒模态计数。

Abstract: Object counting has achieved remarkable success on visible instances, yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods fail under occlusion, a pervasive challenge in real world deployment. This failure stems from a fundamental architectural limitation where backbone networks encode occluding surfaces rather than target objects, thereby corrupting the feature representations required for accurate enumeration. To address this, we present CountOCC, an amodal counting framework that explicitly reconstructs occluded object features through hierarchical multimodal guidance. Rather than accepting degraded encodings, we synthesize complete representations by integrating spatial context from visible fragments with semantic priors from text and visual embeddings, generating class-discriminative features at occluded locations across multiple pyramid levels. We further introduce a visual equivalence objective that enforces consistency in attention space, ensuring that both occluded and unoccluded views of the same scene produce spatially aligned gradient-based attention maps. Together, these complementary mechanisms preserve discriminative properties essential for accurate counting under occlusion. For rigorous evaluation, we establish occlusion-augmented versions of FSC 147 and CARPK spanning both structured and unstructured scenes. CountOCC achieves SOTA performance on FSC 147 with 26.72% and 20.80% MAE reduction over prior baselines under occlusion in validation and test, respectively. CountOCC also demonstrates exceptional generalization by setting new SOTA results on CARPK with 49.89% MAE reduction and on CAPTUREReal with 28.79% MAE reduction, validating robust amodal counting across diverse visual domains. Code will be released soon.

TL;DR: FSDAM是一个少样本驾驶员注意力建模框架，仅需约100个标注样本即可实现联合注意力预测和描述生成，比现有方法少两个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖大规模注视数据集来学习驾驶员注意力模式，但这些数据集收集成本高、整理耗时。需要开发在数据受限场景下仍能有效工作的驾驶员注意力系统。

Method: 采用双路径架构，分别处理空间预测和描述生成，通过跨模态对齐保持语义一致性。

Result: FSDAM在注意力预测方面达到竞争性性能，生成连贯且上下文感知的解释，并在多个驾驶基准测试中展示出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在有限监督下实现有效的注意力条件生成是可行的，为在数据受限场景中实际部署可解释的驾驶员注意力系统开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Understanding where drivers look and why they shift their attention is essential for autonomous systems that read human intent and justify their actions. Most existing models rely on large-scale gaze datasets to learn these patterns; however, such datasets are labor-intensive to collect and time-consuming to curate. We present FSDAM (Few-Shot Driver Attention Modeling), a framework that achieves joint attention prediction and caption generation with approximately 100 annotated examples, two orders of magnitude fewer than existing approaches. Our approach introduces a dual-pathway architecture where separate modules handle spatial prediction and caption generation while maintaining semantic consistency through cross-modal alignment. Despite minimal supervision, FSDAM achieves competitive performance on attention prediction, generates coherent, and context-aware explanations. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization across multiple driving benchmarks. This work shows that effective attention-conditioned generation is achievable with limited supervision, opening new possibilities for practical deployment of explainable driver attention systems in data-constrained scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着OVODs在机器人、自动驾驶等高风险应用中的普及，理解其安全风险变得至关重要。本文旨在揭示由提示调优引入的新攻击面。

Method: 提出TrAP攻击策略：1) 联合优化图像和文本模态的提示参数与视觉触发器；2) 采用课程学习策略逐步缩小触发器尺寸；3) 使用轻量级可学习提示令牌植入后门，无需重新训练基础模型权重。

Conclusion: TrAP攻击展示了OVODs中由提示调优引入的安全漏洞，能够在保持模型泛化能力的同时植入隐藏后门，对实际应用构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors (OVODs) unify vision and language to detect arbitrary object categories based on text prompts, enabling strong zero-shot generalization to novel concepts. As these models gain traction in high-stakes applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and surveillance, understanding their security risks becomes crucial. In this work, we conduct the first study of backdoor attacks on OVODs and reveal a new attack surface introduced by prompt tuning. We propose TrAP (Trigger-Aware Prompt tuning), a multi-modal backdoor injection strategy that jointly optimizes prompt parameters in both image and text modalities along with visual triggers. TrAP enables the attacker to implant malicious behavior using lightweight, learnable prompt tokens without retraining the base model weights, thus preserving generalization while embedding a hidden backdoor. We adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively shrinks the trigger size, enabling effective backdoor activation using small trigger patches at inference. Experiments across multiple datasets show that TrAP achieves high attack success rates for both object misclassification and object disappearance attacks, while also improving clean image performance on downstream datasets compared to the zero-shot setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的注意力监督损失函数KLAL，通过直接监督视觉标记的注意力分布来改善视觉语言模型在视觉任务中的表现，解决了视觉标记在最终层注意力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现视觉语言模型中与查询最相关的视觉标记在LLM模块的最终层几乎不被答案标记关注，这导致视觉问答错误。标准的下一标记预测损失无法有效引导对视觉标记的注意力。

Method: 提出KL注意力损失(KLAL)，通过KL散度将视觉标记的注意力分布与真实注意力图对齐。真实注意力图来自合成任务几何或真实图像的标注，无需新标签。KLAL与NTP损失结合使用。

Result: 在几何任务、指向和指代表达理解等任务上取得显著改进，在合成和真实数据上均表现良好。还创建了新的线追踪评估数据集，发现即使是商业VLM在该任务上表现也不佳。

Conclusion: 直接监督视觉标记的注意力分布能有效提升VLM在视觉任务中的性能，KLAL损失为改善VLM的视觉理解能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) mix visual tokens and text tokens. A puzzling issue is the fact that visual tokens most related to the query receive little to no attention in the final layers of the LLM module of VLMs from the answer tokens, where all tokens are treated equally, in particular, visual and language tokens in the LLM attention layers. This fact may result in wrong answers to visual questions, as our experimental results confirm. It appears that the standard next-token prediction (NTP) loss provides an insufficient signal for directing attention to visual tokens. We hypothesize that a more direct supervision of the attention of visual tokens to corresponding language tokens in the LLM module of VLMs will lead to improved performance on visual tasks. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, we propose a novel loss function that directly supervises the attention of visual tokens. It directly grounds the answer language tokens in images by directing their attention to the relevant visual tokens. This is achieved by aligning the attention distribution of visual tokens to ground truth attention maps with KL divergence. The ground truth attention maps are obtained from task geometry in synthetic cases or from standard grounding annotations (e.g., bounding boxes or point annotations) in real images, and are used inside the LLM for attention supervision without requiring new labels. The obtained KL attention loss (KLAL) when combined with NTP encourages VLMs to attend to relevant visual tokens while generating answer tokens. This results in notable improvements across geometric tasks, pointing, and referring expression comprehension on both synthetic and real-world data, as demonstrated by our experiments. We also introduce a new dataset to evaluate the line tracing abilities of VLMs. Surprisingly, even commercial VLMs do not perform well on this task.

Motivation: 体素化是降低LiDAR数据处理计算成本的有效方法，但会导致细尺度结构信息丢失。研究旨在探索是否可以从高级别体素化LiDAR数据中推断低级别体素内容信息（目标占用百分比）。

Method: 提出基于KPConv的多目标回归方法，采用密度相关性的成本敏感学习处理类别不平衡，使用加权MSE、Focal回归和正则化优化KPConv，并对体素尺寸（0.25-2米）进行敏感性分析。

Result: 敏感性分析显示较大体素尺寸（2米）由于变异性减少而误差较低，而较小体素尺寸（0.25-0.5米）在树冠区域误差较高，特别是树皮和树叶目标的误差在细分辨率下显著更高。

Conclusion: 体素尺寸的选择取决于具体应用，该研究填补了深度不平衡学习模型在森林3D LiDAR点云多目标回归和模拟数据集方面的空白。

Abstract: Voxelization is an effective approach to reduce the computational cost of processing Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, yet it results in a loss of fine-scale structural information. This study explores whether low-level voxel content information, specifically target occupancy percentage within a voxel, can be inferred from high-level voxelized LiDAR point cloud data collected from Digital Imaging and remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) software. In our study, the targets include bark, leaf, soil, and miscellaneous materials. We propose a multi-target regression approach in the context of imbalanced learning using Kernel Point Convolutions (KPConv). Our research leverages cost-sensitive learning to address class imbalance called density-based relevance (DBR). We employ weighted Mean Saquared Erorr (MSE), Focal Regression (FocalR), and regularization to improve the optimization of KPConv. This study performs a sensitivity analysis on the voxel size (0.25 - 2 meters) to evaluate the effect of various grid representations in capturing the nuances of the forest. This sensitivity analysis reveals that larger voxel sizes (e.g., 2 meters) result in lower errors due to reduced variability, while smaller voxel sizes (e.g., 0.25 or 0.5 meter) exhibit higher errors, particularly within the canopy, where variability is greatest. For bark and leaf targets, error values at smaller voxel size datasets (0.25 and 0.5 meter) were significantly higher than those in larger voxel size datasets (2 meters), highlighting the difficulty in accurately estimating within-canopy voxel content at fine resolutions. This suggests that the choice of voxel size is application-dependent. Our work fills the gap in deep imbalance learning models for multi-target regression and simulated datasets for 3D LiDAR point clouds of forests.

TL;DR: SAGE是一种通过对比嵌入将人类显著性先验整合到神经网络训练中的方法，在图像潜在空间中引导模型关注显著特征，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于显著性的训练方法主要依赖图像空间，但研究表明这些内部机制可能不可靠。作者发现将引导方法仅放在图像空间存在挑战，因此转向使用模型的潜在空间嵌入来引导训练。

Method: 提出SAGE损失函数，使用对比嵌入整合人类显著性。对输入应用显著性保持和显著性降级信号增强，捕捉嵌入和模型logits的变化。使用对比三元组损失引导模型关注显著特征并远离非显著特征，同时对logits分布进行完整性检查。

Result: 在开放集和封闭集场景中，相比最先进的基于显著性的方法，SAGE在分类性能上都有提升，并在各种骨干网络和任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SAGE通过将人类显著性引导从图像空间转移到潜在空间，有效提升了模型性能，并在多个任务中展现出广泛的泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating human perceptual priors into the training of neural networks has been shown to raise model generalization, serve as an effective regularizer, and align models with human expertise for applications in high-risk domains. Existing approaches to integrate saliency into model training often rely on internal model mechanisms, which recent research suggests may be unreliable. Our insight is that many challenges associated with saliency-guided training stem from the placement of the guidance approaches solely within the image space. Instead, we move away from the image space, use the model's latent space embeddings to steer human guidance during training, and we propose SAGE (Saliency-Guided Contrastive Embeddings): a loss function that integrates human saliency into network training using contrastive embeddings. We apply salient-preserving and saliency-degrading signal augmentations to the input and capture the changes in embeddings and model logits. We guide the model towards salient features and away from non-salient features using a contrastive triplet loss. Additionally, we perform a sanity check on the logit distributions to ensure that the model outputs match the saliency-based augmentations. We demonstrate a boost in classification performance across both open- and closed-set scenarios against SOTA saliency-based methods, showing SAGE's effectiveness across various backbones, and include experiments to suggest its wide generalization across tasks.

Motivation: 发现Stable Diffusion对CLIP嵌入矩阵的行具有置换不变性，这启发将嵌入视为Wasserstein空间中的点云而非欧氏空间中的矩阵，以更好地理解嵌入空间的几何结构。

Method: 将嵌入插值问题重新定义为最优传输问题，通过求解该问题计算嵌入之间的最短路径（测地线），从而在嵌入空间中实现更自然和几何平滑的过渡。

Result: 实验表明，基于最优传输的插值方法生成的中间图像比标准插值方法更平滑连贯，验证了将嵌入视为点云能更好地反映和利用嵌入空间的几何特性。

Conclusion: 将CLIP嵌入视为Wasserstein空间中的点云而非欧氏空间中的矩阵，能更准确地捕捉嵌入空间的几何结构，基于最优传输的插值方法能产生更高质量的图像插值结果。

Abstract: It can be shown that Stable Diffusion has a permutation-invariance property with respect to the rows of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embedding matrices. This inspired the novel observation that these embeddings can naturally be interpreted as point clouds in a Wasserstein space rather than as matrices in a Euclidean space. This perspective opens up new possibilities for understanding the geometry of embedding space. For example, when interpolating between embeddings of two distinct prompts, we propose reframing the interpolation problem as an optimal transport problem. By solving this optimal transport problem, we compute a shortest path (or geodesic) between embeddings that captures a more natural and geometrically smooth transition through the embedding space. This results in smoother and more coherent intermediate (interpolated) images when rendered by the Stable Diffusion generative model. We conduct experiments to investigate this effect, comparing the quality of interpolated images produced using optimal transport to those generated by other standard interpolation methods. The novel optimal transport--based approach presented indeed gives smoother image interpolations, suggesting that viewing the embeddings as point clouds (rather than as matrices) better reflects and leverages the geometry of the embedding space.

Abstract: Automatic sign language recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between deaf communities and hearing individuals; however, most available datasets focus on American Sign Language. For Romanian Isolated Sign Language Recognition (RoISLR), no large-scale, standardized dataset exists, which limits research progress. In this work, we introduce a new corpus for RoISLR, named RoCoISLR, comprising over 9,000 video samples that span nearly 6,000 standardized glosses from multiple sources. We establish benchmark results by evaluating seven state-of-the-art video recognition models-I3D, SlowFast, Swin Transformer, TimeSformer, Uniformer, VideoMAE, and PoseConv3D-under consistent experimental setups, and compare their performance with that of the widely used WLASL2000 corpus. According to the results, transformer-based architectures outperform convolutional baselines; Swin Transformer achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 34.1%. Our benchmarks highlight the challenges associated with long-tail class distributions in low-resource sign languages, and RoCoISLR provides the initial foundation for systematic RoISLR research.

Abstract: Color harmonization adjusts the colors of an inserted object so that it perceptually matches the surrounding image, resulting in a seamless composite. The harmonization problem naturally arises in augmented reality (AR), yet harmonization algorithms are not currently integrated into AR pipelines because real-time solutions are scarce. In this work, we address color harmonization for AR by proposing a lightweight approach that supports on-device inference. For this, we leverage classical optimal transport theory by training a compact encoder to predict the Monge-Kantorovich transport map. We benchmark our MKL-Harmonizer algorithm against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that for real composite AR images our method achieves the best aggregated score. We release our dedicated AR dataset of composite images with pixel-accurate masks and data-gathering toolkit to support further data acquisition by researchers.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is vital for diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Deep learning has advanced on benchmarks, but two issues limit clinical use: no uncertainty estimates for errors and no segmentation of healthy brain structures around tumors for surgery. Current methods fail to unify tumor localization with anatomical context and lack confidence scores. This study presents an uncertainty-aware framework augmenting nnUNet with a channel for voxel-wise uncertainty. Trained on BraTS2023, it yields a correlation of 0.750 and RMSD of 0.047 for uncertainty without hurting tumor accuracy. It predicts uncertainty in one pass, with no extra networks or inferences, aiding clinical decisions. For whole-brain context, a unified model combines normal and cancer datasets, achieving a DSC of 0.81 for brain structures and 0.86 for tumor, with robust key-region performance. Combining both innovations gives the first model outputting tumor in natural surroundings plus an overlaid uncertainty map. Visual checks of outputs show uncertainty offers key insights to evaluate predictions and fix errors, helping informed surgical decisions from AI.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection is an emerging and challenging computer vision task that requires identifying and segmenting objects that blend seamlessly into their environments due to high similarity in color, texture, and size. This task is further complicated by low-light conditions, partial occlusion, small object size, intricate background patterns, and multiple objects. While many sophisticated methods have been proposed for this task, current methods still struggle to precisely detect camouflaged objects in complex scenarios, especially with small and multiple objects, indicating room for improvement. We propose a Multi-Scale Recursive Network that extracts multi-scale features via a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone and combines them via specialized Attention-Based Scale Integration Units, enabling selective feature merging. For more precise object detection, our decoder recursively refines features by incorporating Multi-Granularity Fusion Units. A novel recursive-feedback decoding strategy is developed to enhance global context understanding, helping the model overcome the challenges in this task.

TL;DR: SAGA是首个用于AI生成视频源归属的综合框架，通过多粒度归属识别生成模型，仅需0.5%的源标记数据即可达到最先进性能，并提供可解释的时间注意力特征可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI产生的超现实合成视频存在滥用风险，传统的二元真伪检测已无法满足需求，迫切需要能够识别具体生成模型的源归属技术。

Method: 采用新颖的视频transformer架构，利用稳健视觉基础模型特征捕捉时空伪影；提出数据高效的预训练-归属策略；引入时间注意力特征(T-Sigs)进行可解释性分析。

Result: 在公共数据集上实现最先进的合成视频溯源性能，在跨域场景中表现优异，仅需每类0.5%的源标记数据即可匹配全监督性能。

Conclusion: SAGA为法证和监管应用提供了关键的、可解释的合成视频溯源能力，建立了新的基准。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative AI has led to hyper-realistic synthetic videos, escalating misuse risks and outstripping binary real/fake detectors. We introduce SAGA (Source Attribution of Generative AI videos), the first comprehensive framework to address the urgent need for AI-generated video source attribution at a large scale. Unlike traditional detection, SAGA identifies the specific generative model used. It uniquely provides multi-granular attribution across five levels: authenticity, generation task (e.g., T2V/I2V), model version, development team, and the precise generator, offering far richer forensic insights. Our novel video transformer architecture, leveraging features from a robust vision foundation model, effectively captures spatio-temporal artifacts. Critically, we introduce a data-efficient pretrain-and-attribute strategy, enabling SAGA to achieve state-of-the-art attribution using only 0.5\% of source-labeled data per class, matching fully supervised performance. Furthermore, we propose Temporal Attention Signatures (T-Sigs), a novel interpretability method that visualizes learned temporal differences, offering the first explanation for why different video generators are distinguishable. Extensive experiments on public datasets, including cross-domain scenarios, demonstrate that SAGA sets a new benchmark for synthetic video provenance, providing crucial, interpretable insights for forensic and regulatory applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了视觉思维链(vCoT)方法，通过生成帧间过渡事件描述来增强多模态大语言模型的视频理解能力，发现视频微调模型已隐式掌握时序推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型从图像扩展到视频时通常只是简单拼接帧标记，缺乏有效的时序推理能力，需要研究视频微调带来的具体改进。

Method: 提出视觉思维链(vCoT)方法，生成连续帧之间的过渡事件描述作为显式推理过程，系统比较图像模型与视频微调模型在有无过渡线索下的表现。

Result: vCoT显著提升图像模型在长视频问答中的性能，但对视频模型增益有限；视频模型能将时序推理能力迁移到静态视觉推理任务，表现优于图像模型。

Conclusion: 视频微调使模型隐式掌握了帧间过渡推理能力，这种时序推理能力可迁移到静态视觉任务，为多模态模型发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in visual understanding, yet their extension from images to videos often reduces to a naive concatenation of frame tokens. In this work, we investigate what video finetuning brings to multimodal LLMs. We propose Visual Chain-of-Thought (vCoT), an explicit reasoning process that generates transitional event descriptions between consecutive frames. Using vCoT, we systematically compare image-only LVLMs with their video-finetuned counterparts, both with and without access to these transitional cues. Our experiments show that vCoT significantly improves the performance of image-only models on long-form video question answering, while yielding only marginal gains for video-finetuned models. This suggests that the latter already capture frame-to-frame transitions implicitly. Moreover, we find that video models transfer this temporal reasoning ability to purely static settings, outperforming image models' baselines on relational visual reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对完全重叠的多视图设置，而现实场景中传感器通常只有部分重叠且模态有限，同时缺乏密集帧级标注，需要解决视图不对齐和模态不完整的问题。

Method: 使用跨模态适配器和注意力机制让学生模型利用多模态相关性；提出视图感知一致性模块，通过人体检测掩码和置信度加权的Jensen-Shannon散度来强制共可见视图间的预测对齐。

Result: 在真实世界MultiSensor-Home数据集上，ViCoKD在多种骨干网络和环境设置下均优于竞争蒸馏方法，在受限条件下甚至超越了教师模型。

Conclusion: ViCoKD框架有效解决了部分重叠多视图动作识别中的模态限制和视图不对齐问题，在真实场景中表现出色。

Abstract: The widespread use of multi-sensor systems has increased research in multi-view action recognition. While existing approaches in multi-view setups with fully overlapping sensors benefit from consistent view coverage, partially overlapping settings where actions are visible in only a subset of views remain underexplored. This challenge becomes more severe in real-world scenarios, as many systems provide only limited input modalities and rely on sequence-level annotations instead of dense frame-level labels. In this study, we propose View-aware Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ViCoKD), a framework that distills knowledge from a fully supervised multi-modal teacher to a modality- and annotation-limited student. ViCoKD employs a cross-modal adapter with cross-modal attention, allowing the student to exploit multi-modal correlations while operating with incomplete modalities. Moreover, we propose a View-aware Consistency module to address view misalignment, where the same action may appear differently or only partially across viewpoints. It enforces prediction alignment when the action is co-visible across views, guided by human-detection masks and confidence-weighted Jensen-Shannon divergence between their predicted class distributions. Experiments on the real-world MultiSensor-Home dataset show that ViCoKD consistently outperforms competitive distillation methods across multiple backbones and environments, delivering significant gains and surpassing the teacher model under limited conditions.

Abstract: Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., "how to interact"). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., "when to interact") is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Motivation: 当前绘画创造力评估主要依赖专家主观评分，既费时又主观。需要开发自动化和可解释的评估方法来克服这些限制。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在回归方法中达到最先进性能，并提供与人类判断一致的可解释可视化结果。

Conclusion: 该框架能够自动且可解释地评估绘画创造力，为创造力研究提供了新的数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Assessing human creativity through visual outputs, such as drawings, plays a critical role in fields including psychology, education, and cognitive science. However, current assessment practices still rely heavily on expert-based subjective scoring, which is both labor-intensive and inherently subjective. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for automatic and interpretable creativity assessment from drawings. Motivated by the cognitive understanding that creativity can emerge from both what is drawn (content) and how it is drawn (style), we reinterpret the creativity score as a function of these two complementary dimensions.Specifically, we first augment an existing creativity labeled dataset with additional annotations targeting content categories. Based on the enriched dataset, we further propose a multi-modal, multi-task learning framework that simultaneously predicts creativity scores, categorizes content types, and extracts stylistic features. In particular, we introduce a conditional learning mechanism that enables the model to adapt its visual feature extraction by dynamically tuning it to creativity-relevant signals conditioned on the drawing's stylistic and semantic cues.Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing regression-based approaches and offers interpretable visualizations that align well with human judgments. The code and annotations will be made publicly available at https://github.com/WonderOfU9/CSCA_PRCV_2025

Motivation: 现有静态剪枝方法会永久移除权重或token，破坏预训练依赖关系，导致性能下降。VAR模型随着序列长度增加面临计算成本急剧上升的问题。

Method: 将前馈网络分解为轻量级专家子网络，使用可学习路由器动态选择token特定的专家子集；同时采用门控token选择器识别高更新潜力token进行计算，重构未选token以保持全局上下文和序列对齐；采用两阶段知识蒸馏策略，原始VAR模型监督路由和门控策略学习。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256基准测试中，ActVAR实现了高达21.2%的FLOPs减少，且性能退化最小。

Conclusion: ActVAR通过动态激活机制有效解决了VAR模型计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models enable efficient image generation via next-scale prediction but face escalating computational costs as sequence length grows. Existing static pruning methods degrade performance by permanently removing weights or tokens, disrupting pretrained dependencies. To address this, we propose ActVAR, a dynamic activation framework that introduces dual sparsity across model weights and token sequences to enhance efficiency without sacrificing capacity. ActVAR decomposes feedforward networks (FFNs) into lightweight expert sub-networks and employs a learnable router to dynamically select token-specific expert subsets based on content. Simultaneously, a gated token selector identifies high-update-potential tokens for computation while reconstructing unselected tokens to preserve global context and sequence alignment. Training employs a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, where the original VAR model supervises the learning of routing and gating policies to align with pretrained knowledge. Experiments on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark demonstrate that ActVAR achieves up to $21.2\%$ FLOPs reduction with minimal performance degradation.

Motivation: 专业数字媒体制作需要HDR成像，但现有3D重建方法主要基于LDR数据，限制了在专业工作流程中的应用。

Method: 提出Native High dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting (NH-3DGS)，采用新颖的亮度-色度分解颜色表示，直接从原生HDR相机数据优化。

Result: 在合成和真实多视角HDR数据集上，NH-3DGS在重建质量和动态范围保持方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NH-3DGS能够直接从原生HDR捕获实现专业级3D重建，为专业工作流程提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging is essential for professional digital media creation, e.g., filmmaking, virtual production, and photorealistic rendering. However, 3D scene reconstruction has primarily focused on Low Dynamic Range (LDR) data, limiting its applicability to professional workflows. Existing approaches that reconstruct HDR scenes from LDR observations rely on multi-exposure fusion or inverse tone-mapping, which increase capture complexity and depend on synthetic supervision. With the recent emergence of cameras that directly capture native HDR data in a single exposure, we present the first method for 3D scene reconstruction that directly models native HDR observations. We propose {\bf Native High dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting (NH-3DGS)}, which preserves the full dynamic range throughout the reconstruction pipeline. Our key technical contribution is a novel luminance-chromaticity decomposition of the color representation that enables direct optimization from native HDR camera data. We demonstrate on both synthetic and real multi-view HDR datasets that NH-3DGS significantly outperforms existing methods in reconstruction quality and dynamic range preservation, enabling professional-grade 3D reconstruction directly from native HDR captures. Code and datasets will be made available.

Conclusion: 频率域分析为脑MRI无监督异常检测提供了新视角，FDP框架通过同时抑制病理特征和保留解剖结构，有效提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Due to the diversity of brain anatomy and the scarcity of annotated data, supervised anomaly detection for brain MRI remains challenging, driving the development of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) approaches. Current UAD methods typically utilize artificially generated noise perturbations on healthy MRIs to train generative models for normal anatomy reconstruction, enabling anomaly detection via residual mapping. However, such simulated anomalies lack the biophysical fidelity and morphological complexity characteristic of true clinical lesions. To advance UAD in brain MRI, we conduct the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of pathological signatures, revealing two key properties: (1) anomalies exhibit unique frequency patterns distinguishable from normal anatomy, and (2) low-frequency signals maintain consistent representations across healthy scans. These insights motivate our Frequency-Decomposition Preprocessing (FDP) framework, the first UAD method to leverage frequency-domain reconstruction for simultaneous pathology suppression and anatomical preservation. FDP can integrate seamlessly with existing anomaly simulation techniques, consistently enhancing detection performance across diverse architectures while maintaining diagnostic fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FDP consistently improves anomaly detection performance when integrated with existing methods. Notably, FDP achieves a 17.63% increase in DICE score with LDM while maintaining robust improvements across multiple baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ls1rius/MRI_FDP.

Abstract: Sports video understanding presents unique challenges, requiring models to perceive high-speed dynamics, comprehend complex rules, and reason over long temporal contexts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in genral domains, the current state of research in sports remains narrowly focused: existing approaches are either single-sport centric, limited to specific tasks, or rely on training-free paradigms that lack robust, learned reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce DeepSport, the first end-to-end trained MLLM framework designed for multi-task, multi-sport video understanding. DeepSport shifts the paradigm from passive frame processing to active, iterative reasoning, empowering the model to ``think with videos'' by dynamically interrogating content via a specialized frame-extraction tool. To enable this, we propose a data distillation pipeline that synthesizes high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories from 10 diverse data source, creating a unified resource of 78k training data. We then employ a two-stage training strategy, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel gated tool-use reward, to optimize the model's reasoning process. Extensive experiments on the testing benchmark of 6.7k questions demonstrate that DeepSport achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines of both proprietary model and open-source models. Our work establishes a new foundation for domain-specific video reasoning to address the complexities of diverse sports.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3D anomaly detection methods have demonstrated significant potential in industrial manufacturing. However, many approaches are specifically designed for anomaly detection tasks, which limits their generalizability to other 3D understanding tasks. In contrast, self-supervised point cloud models aim for general-purpose representation learning, yet our investigation reveals that these classical models are suboptimal at anomaly detection under the unified fine-tuning paradigm. This motivates us to develop a more generalizable 3D model that can effectively detect anomalies without relying on task-specific designs. Interestingly, we find that using only the curvature of each point as its anomaly score already outperforms several classical self-supervised and dedicated anomaly detection models, highlighting the critical role of curvature in 3D anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a Curvature-Augmented Self-supervised Learning (CASL) framework based on a reconstruction paradigm. Built upon the classical U-Net architecture, our approach introduces multi-scale curvature prompts to guide the decoder in predicting the spatial coordinates of each point. Without relying on any dedicated anomaly detection mechanisms, it achieves leading detection performance through straightforward anomaly classification fine-tuning. Moreover, the learned representations generalize well to standard 3D understanding tasks such as point cloud classification. The code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CASL.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have played an increasingly important role in multimodal intelligence. However, the existing fine-tuning methods often ignore cross-modal heterogeneity, limiting their full potential. In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy by injecting beneficial random noise, which outperforms previous methods and even surpasses full fine-tuning, with minimal additional parameters. The proposed Multimodal Noise Generator (MuNG) enables efficient modality fine-tuning by injecting customized noise into the frozen MLLMs. Specifically, we reformulate the reasoning process of MLLMs from a variational inference perspective, upon which we design a multimodal noise generator that dynamically analyzes cross-modal relationships in image-text pairs to generate task-adaptive beneficial noise. Injecting this type of noise into the MLLMs effectively suppresses irrelevant semantic components, leading to significantly improved cross-modal representation alignment and enhanced performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two mainstream MLLMs, QwenVL and LLaVA, demonstrate that our method surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning and other existing fine-tuning approaches, while requiring adjustments to only about $1\sim2\%$ additional parameters.

Motivation: 现有基于单参考视图的6D姿态估计方法依赖实值坐标回归，存在全局一致性不足和对称/遮挡场景下不确定性建模缺失的问题。

Method: 提出坐标图token化、模态解耦编码和自回归Transformer解码器，将3D-3D对应关系建模为离散token序列进行概率预测。

Conclusion: CoordAR通过自回归概率建模有效解决了单参考6D姿态估计中的对称性和遮挡问题，为无3D模型的物体姿态估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object 6D pose estimation, a crucial task for robotics and augmented reality applications, becomes particularly challenging when dealing with novel objects whose 3D models are not readily available. To reduce dependency on 3D models, recent studies have explored one-reference-based pose estimation, which requires only a single reference view instead of a complete 3D model. However, existing methods that rely on real-valued coordinate regression suffer from limited global consistency due to the local nature of convolutional architectures and face challenges in symmetric or occluded scenarios owing to a lack of uncertainty modeling. We present CoordAR, a novel autoregressive framework for one-reference 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. CoordAR formulates 3D-3D correspondences between the reference and query views as a map of discrete tokens, which is obtained in an autoregressive and probabilistic manner. To enable accurate correspondence regression, CoordAR introduces 1) a novel coordinate map tokenization that enables probabilistic prediction over discretized 3D space; 2) a modality-decoupled encoding strategy that separately encodes RGB appearance and coordinate cues; and 3) an autoregressive transformer decoder conditioned on both position-aligned query features and the partially generated token sequence. With these novel mechanisms, CoordAR significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks and demonstrates strong robustness to symmetry, occlusion, and other challenges in real-world tests.

Result: 广泛实验表明，该模型生成具有精确控制、用户指定摄影相机效果的高保真视频。

Conclusion: CineCtrl成功实现了对专业相机参数的精细控制，为视频电影化编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cinematic storytelling is profoundly shaped by the artful manipulation of photographic elements such as depth of field and exposure. These effects are crucial in conveying mood and creating aesthetic appeal. However, controlling these effects in generative video models remains highly challenging, as most existing methods are restricted to camera motion control. In this paper, we propose CineCtrl, the first video cinematic editing framework that provides fine control over professional camera parameters (e.g., bokeh, shutter speed). We introduce a decoupled cross-attention mechanism to disentangle camera motion from photographic inputs, allowing fine-grained, independent control without compromising scene consistency. To overcome the shortage of training data, we develop a comprehensive data generation strategy that leverages simulated photographic effects with a dedicated real-world collection pipeline, enabling the construction of a large-scale dataset for robust model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates high-fidelity videos with precisely controlled, user-specified photographic camera effects.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of intelligent transportation systems, text-driven image generation and editing techniques have demonstrated significant potential in providing rich, controllable visual scene data for applications such as traffic monitoring and autonomous driving. However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从现实世界"每日穿搭"照片重建3D虚拟形象的挑战，这些照片通常包含多样姿态、遮挡和复杂背景，传统方法通过分割服装配饰进行3D组装容易产生不一致性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用ControlNet进行姿态估计和条件先验保持损失，微调姿态感知扩散模型；2) 通过规范SMPL-X空间采样和多分辨率3D-SDS优化NeRF表示的虚拟形象，避免网格表示的分辨率依赖离散化和遮挡几何错误。

Conclusion: PFAvatar通过端到端学习完整外观和连续辐射场表示，推进了从现实世界OOTD相册生成实用3D虚拟形象的能力，展示了方法的通用性和实用价值。

Abstract: We propose PFAvatar (Pose-Fusion Avatar), a new method that reconstructs high-quality 3D avatars from ``Outfit of the Day'' (OOTD) photos, which exhibit diverse poses, occlusions, and complex backgrounds. Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48$\times$ speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach.

Conclusion: ProtoAnomalyNCD能够有效发现未见异常类，实现多类型异常分类，并扩展到检测未见异常点，实现任务级统一。

Abstract: Existing industrial anomaly detection methods mainly determine whether an anomaly is present. However, real-world applications also require discovering and classifying multiple anomaly types. Since industrial anomalies are semantically subtle and current methods do not sufficiently exploit image priors, direct clustering approaches often perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose ProtoAnomalyNCD, a prototype-learning-based framework for discovering unseen anomaly classes of multiple types that can be integrated with various anomaly detection methods. First, to suppress background clutter, we leverage Grounded SAM with text prompts to localize object regions as priors for the anomaly classification network. Next, because anomalies usually appear as subtle and fine-grained patterns on the product, we introduce an Anomaly-Map-Guided Attention block. Within this block, we design a Region Guidance Factor that helps the attention module distinguish among background, object regions, and anomalous regions. By using both localized product regions and anomaly maps as priors, the module enhances anomalous features while suppressing background noise and preserving normal features for contrastive learning. Finally, under a unified prototype-learning framework, ProtoAnomalyNCD discovers and clusters unseen anomaly classes while simultaneously enabling multi-type anomaly classification. We further extend our method to detect unseen outliers, achieving task-level unification. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the MVTec AD, MTD, and Real-IAD datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于半监督学习的高动态范围图像重建方法，通过教师模型生成伪HDR标签，并使用不确定性掩码机制过滤不可靠区域，仅需6.7%的HDR真实标签即可达到与全监督方法相当的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的HDR图像重建方法需要大量的LDR-HDR图像对，但这些数据对难以获取，因此需要研究如何在有限HDR真实标签下实现可比较性能的标注高效方法。

Method: 采用半监督学习框架，教师模型为无标签的LDR样本生成伪HDR标签，学生模型从伪标签中学习。提出基于不确定性的掩码过程，在像素和补丁级别丢弃伪标签中的不可靠部分，学生仅从可信区域学习。

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性掩码机制有效缓解了确认偏差问题，使得半监督HDR重建方法在有限标注数据下仍能取得优异性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing high dynamic range (HDR) images from low dynamic range (LDR) bursts plays an essential role in the computational photography. Impressive progress has been achieved by learning-based algorithms which require LDR-HDR image pairs. However, these pairs are hard to obtain, which motivates researchers to delve into the problem of annotation-efficient HDR image reconstructing: how to achieve comparable performance with limited HDR ground truths (GTs). This work attempts to address this problem from the view of semi-supervised learning where a teacher model generates pseudo HDR GTs for the LDR samples without GTs and a student model learns from pseudo GTs. Nevertheless, the confirmation bias, i.e., the student may learn from the artifacts in pseudo HDR GTs, presents an impediment. To remove this impediment, an uncertainty-based masking process is proposed to discard unreliable parts of pseudo GTs at both pixel and patch levels, then the trusted areas can be learned from by the student. With this novel masking process, our semi-supervised HDR reconstructing method not only outperforms previous annotation-efficient algorithms, but also achieves comparable performance with up-to-date fully-supervised methods by using only 6.7% HDR GTs.

Conclusion: RAD框架通过结合扩散模型和LSTM，有效解决了长期视频生成中的记忆保持问题，展示了LSTM在序列建模中的优势。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have demonstrated the potential of using video diffusion models as world models, with autoregressive generation of infinitely long videos through masked conditioning. However, such models, usually with local full attention, lack effective memory compression and retrieval for long-term generation beyond the window size, leading to issues of forgetting and spatiotemporal inconsistencies. To enhance the retention of historical information within a fixed memory budget, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) into the diffusion transformer framework. Specifically, a diffusion model incorporating LSTM with attention achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art RNN blocks, such as TTT and Mamba2. Moreover, existing diffusion-RNN approaches often suffer from performance degradation due to training-inference gap or the lack of overlap across windows. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Recurrent Autoregressive Diffusion (RAD) framework, which executes frame-wise autoregression for memory update and retrieval, consistently across training and inference time. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate the superiority of RAD for long video generation, highlighting the efficiency of LSTM in sequence modeling.

Abstract: Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems play a critical role in Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, enabling real-time detection of road signs, such as STOP and speed limit signs. While these systems are increasingly integrated into commercial vehicles, recent research has exposed their vulnerability to physical-world adversarial appearance attacks. In such attacks, carefully crafted visual patterns are misinterpreted by TSR models as legitimate traffic signs, while remaining inconspicuous or benign to human observers. However, existing adversarial appearance attacks suffer from notable limitations. Pixel-level perturbation-based methods often lack stealthiness and tend to overfit to specific surrogate models, resulting in poor transferability to real-world TSR systems. On the other hand, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model-based approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness and poor generalization to out-of-distribution sign types.
  In this paper, we present DiffSign, a novel T2I-based appearance attack framework designed to generate physically robust, highly effective, transferable, practical, and stealthy appearance attacks against TSR systems. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, we propose a carefully designed attack pipeline that integrates CLIP-based loss and masked prompts to improve attack focus and controllability. We also propose two novel style customization methods to guide visual appearance and improve out-of-domain traffic sign attack generalization and attack stealthiness. We conduct extensive evaluations of DiffSign under varied real-world conditions, including different distances, angles, light conditions, and sign categories. Our method achieves an average physical-world attack success rate of 83.3%, leveraging DiffSign's high effectiveness in attack transferability.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated high performance in image classification tasks by effectively utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. However, existing SSL methods often suffer from poor calibration, with models yielding overconfident predictions that misrepresent actual prediction likelihoods. Recently, neural networks trained with {\tt mixup} that linearly interpolates random examples from the training set have shown better calibration in supervised settings. However, calibration of neural models remains under-explored in semi-supervised settings. Although effective in supervised model calibration, random mixup of pseudolabels in SSL presents challenges due to the overconfidence and unreliability of pseudolabels. In this work, we introduce CalibrateMix, a targeted mixup-based approach that aims to improve the calibration of SSL models while maintaining or even improving their classification accuracy. Our method leverages training dynamics of labeled and unlabeled samples to identify ``easy-to-learn'' and ``hard-to-learn'' samples, which in turn are utilized in a targeted mixup of easy and hard samples. Experimental results across several benchmark image datasets show that our method achieves lower expected calibration error (ECE) and superior accuracy compared to existing SSL approaches.

Conclusion: GrOCE无需重新训练即可实现精确、自适应的概念擦除，在保持全局语义的同时有效隔离不需要的内容。

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to remove harmful, inappropriate, or copyrighted content from text-to-image diffusion models while preserving non-target semantics. However, existing methods either rely on costly fine-tuning or apply coarse semantic separation, often degrading unrelated concepts and lacking adaptability to evolving concept sets. To alleviate this issue, we propose Graph-Guided Online Concept Erasure (GrOCE), a training-free framework that performs precise and adaptive concept removal through graph-based semantic reasoning. GrOCE models concepts and their interrelations as a dynamic semantic graph, enabling principled reasoning over dependencies and fine-grained isolation of undesired content. It comprises three components: (1) Dynamic Topological Graph Construction for incremental graph building, (2) Adaptive Cluster Identification for multi-hop traversal with similarity-decay scoring, and (3) Selective Edge Severing for targeted edge removal while preserving global semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GrOCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on Concept Similarity (CS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metrics, offering efficient, accurate, and stable concept erasure without retraining.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) bridges gene expression and tissue morphology but faces clinical adoption barriers due to technical complexity and prohibitive costs. While computational methods predict gene expression from H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs), existing approaches often fail to capture the intricate biological heterogeneity within spots and are susceptible to morphological noise when integrating contextual information from surrounding tissue. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiFusion, a novel deep learning framework that integrates two complementary components. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Intra-Spot Modeling module that extracts fine-grained morphological representations through multi-resolution sub-patch decomposition, guided by a feature alignment loss to ensure semantic consistency across scales. Concurrently, we present the Context-aware Cross-scale Fusion module, which employs cross-attention to selectively incorporate biologically relevant regional context, thereby enhancing representational capacity. This architecture enables comprehensive modeling of both cellular-level features and tissue microenvironmental cues, which are essential for accurate gene expression prediction. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ST datasets demonstrate that HiFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across both 2D slide-wise cross-validation and more challenging 3D sample-specific scenarios. These results underscore HiFusion's potential as a robust, accurate, and scalable solution for ST inference from routine histopathology.

Motivation: 传统神经网络量化方法在空间区域上采用统一的位精度，忽略了视觉数据在结构和纹理上的异质性。本文旨在解决这种空间均匀量化对复杂视觉形态处理不足的问题。

Method: 使用五种形态学指标（分形维度、纹理熵、梯度方差、边缘密度和轮廓复杂度）来表征局部视觉形态，并基于这些指标与量化敏感性的相关性进行空间自适应位分配。同时采用基于课程的量化感知训练方案逐步增加量化难度。

Conclusion: 形态驱动的空间量化能够提升计算受限、安全关键视觉识别任务的效率和鲁棒性，证明了形态复杂度与量化敏感性之间的强相关性。

Abstract: Most neural network quantization methods apply uniform bit precision across spatial regions, ignoring the heterogeneous structural and textural complexity of visual data. This paper introduces MCAQ-YOLO, a morphological complexity-aware quantization framework for object detection. The framework employs five morphological metrics - fractal dimension, texture entropy, gradient variance, edge density, and contour complexity - to characterize local visual morphology and guide spatially adaptive bit allocation. By correlating these metrics with quantization sensitivity, MCAQ-YOLO dynamically adjusts bit precision according to spatial complexity. In addition, a curriculum-based quantization-aware training scheme progressively increases quantization difficulty to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between morphological complexity and quantization sensitivity and show that MCAQ-YOLO achieves superior detection accuracy and convergence efficiency compared with uniform quantization. On a safety equipment dataset, MCAQ-YOLO attains 85.6 percent mAP@0.5 with an average of 4.2 bits and a 7.6x compression ratio, yielding 3.5 percentage points higher mAP than uniform 4-bit quantization while introducing only 1.8 ms of additional runtime overhead per image. Cross-dataset validation on COCO and Pascal VOC further confirms consistent performance gains, indicating that morphology-driven spatial quantization can enhance efficiency and robustness for computationally constrained, safety-critical visual recognition tasks.

Abstract: Building interactive simulators and scalable robot-learning environments requires a large number of articulated assets. However, most existing 3D assets in simulation are rigid, and manually converting them into articulated objects is extremely labor- and cost-intensive. This raises a natural question: can we automatically identify articulable objects in a scene and convert them into articulated assets directly? In this paper, we present ArtiWorld, a scene-aware pipeline that localizes candidate articulable objects from textual scene descriptions and reconstructs executable URDF models that preserve the original geometry. At the core of this pipeline is Arti4URDF, which leverages 3D point cloud, prior knowledge of a large language model (LLM), and a URDF-oriented prompt design to rapidly convert rigid objects into interactive URDF-based articulated objects while maintaining their 3D shape. We evaluate ArtiWorld at three levels: 3D simulated objects, full 3D simulated scenes, and real-world scan scenes. Across all three settings, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving object geometry and correctly capturing object interactivity to produce usable URDF-based articulated models. This provides a practical path toward building interactive, robot-ready simulation environments directly from existing 3D assets. Code and data will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本识别方面表现强劲，但容易受到虚假相关性的影响，特别是对背景的过度依赖。现有基准仅依赖准确度，隐含地将所有性能下降归因于背景相关性，这种假设是不完整的。

Method: 提出CCI方法：使用CLIP的patch嵌入将空间patch聚类成语义连贯的簇，掩码这些簇并评估模型预测的相对变化。结合GroundedSAM自动将预测分类为前景驱动或背景驱动。引入COVAR基准系统性地变化对象前景和背景。

Result: CCI在忠实度基准测试中达到新SOTA，在MS COCO检索的删除AUC指标上实现了超过两倍的改进。通过CCI与COVAR结合，对18个CLIP变体进行了全面评估。

Conclusion: CCI方法提供了重要的诊断能力，能够区分前景和背景驱动的预测。COVAR基准揭示了除背景相关性外，视角变化、尺度偏移和细粒度对象混淆也是导致错误的重要因素，为构建更鲁棒的视觉语言模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition yet remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, particularly background over-reliance. We introduce Cluster-based Concept Importance (CCI), a novel interpretability method that uses CLIP's own patch embeddings to group spatial patches into semantically coherent clusters, mask them, and evaluate relative changes in model predictions. CCI sets a new state of the art on faithfulness benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by large margins; for example, it yields more than a twofold improvement on the deletion-AUC metric for MS COCO retrieval. We further propose that CCI, when combined with GroundedSAM, automatically categorizes predictions as foreground- or background-driven, providing a crucial diagnostic ability. Existing benchmarks such as CounterAnimals, however, rely solely on accuracy and implicitly attribute all performance degradation to background correlations. Our analysis shows this assumption to be incomplete, since many errors arise from viewpoint variation, scale shifts, and fine-grained object confusions. To disentangle these effects, we introduce COVAR, a benchmark that systematically varies object foregrounds and backgrounds. Leveraging CCI with COVAR, we present a comprehensive evaluation of eighteen CLIP variants, offering methodological advances and empirical evidence that chart a path toward more robust VLMs.

Dataset pruning addresses this challenge by constructing a compact but informative coreset from the full dataset with comparable performance. Previous approaches typically establish scoring metrics based on specific criteria to identify representative samples. However, these methods predominantly rely on sample scores obtained from the model's performance during the training (i.e., fitting) phase. As scoring models achieve near-optimal performance on training data, such fitting-centric approaches induce a dense distribution of sample scores within a narrow numerical range. This concentration reduces the distinction between samples and hinders effective selection. To address this challenge, we conduct dataset pruning from the perspective of generalization, i.e., scoring samples based on models not exposed to them during training. We propose a plug-and-play framework, UNSEEN, which can be integrated into existing dataset pruning methods. Additionally, conventional score-based methods are single-step and rely on models trained solely on the complete dataset, providing limited perspective on the importance of samples. To address this limitation, we scale UNSEEN to multi-step scenarios and propose an incremental selection technique through scoring models trained on varying coresets, and optimize the quality of the coreset dynamically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. Notably, on ImageNet-1K, UNSEEN achieves lossless performance while reducing training data by 30\%.

Conclusion: WSAE-Net通过语义感知的编辑策略显著提升了视觉反事实解释的质量和效率。

Abstract: In the domain of non-generative visual counterfactual explanations (CE), traditional techniques frequently involve the substitution of sections within a query image with corresponding sections from distractor images. Such methods have historically overlooked the semantic relevance of the replacement regions to the target object, thereby impairing the model's interpretability and hindering the editing workflow. Addressing these challenges, the present study introduces an innovative methodology named as Weighted Semantic Map with Auto-adaptive Candidate Editing Network (WSAE-Net). Characterized by two significant advancements: the determination of an weighted semantic map and the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequence. First, the generation of the weighted semantic map is designed to maximize the reduction of non-semantic feature units that need to be computed, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. Second, the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequences are designed to determine the optimal computational order among the feature units to be processed, thereby ensuring the efficient generation of counterfactuals while maintaining the semantic relevance of the replacement feature units to the target object. Through comprehensive experimentation, our methodology demonstrates superior performance, contributing to a more lucid and in-depth understanding of visual counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Image retouching aims to enhance visual quality while aligning with users' personalized aesthetic preferences. To address the challenge of balancing controllability and subjectivity, we propose a unified diffusion-based image retouching framework called PerTouch. Our method supports semantic-level image retouching while maintaining global aesthetics. Using parameter maps containing attribute values in specific semantic regions as input, PerTouch constructs an explicit parameter-to-image mapping for fine-grained image retouching. To improve semantic boundary perception, we introduce semantic replacement and parameter perturbation mechanisms in the training process. To connect natural language instructions with visual control, we develop a VLM-driven agent that can handle both strong and weak user instructions. Equipped with mechanisms of feedback-driven rethinking and scene-aware memory, PerTouch better aligns with user intent and captures long-term preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate each component's effectiveness and the superior performance of PerTouch in personalized image retouching.

TL;DR: Medal S是一个医学分割基础模型，支持原生分辨率空间和文本提示的端到端训练框架，在五个医学影像模态上实现了高效的多类别分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本提示方法缺乏空间感知能力，且分辨率不匹配会导致不准确性。需要开发一个能够同时处理空间和文本提示的医学分割模型。

Method: 通过通道对齐实现体积提示与文本嵌入的匹配，使用轻量级3D卷积模块进行体素空间细化，支持并行处理多个原生分辨率掩码，并提出动态重采样、两阶段推理等优化技术。

Result: 在BiomedSegFM数据集验证集上，Medal S在五个模态平均DSC达到75.44（vs SAT的69.83），NSD达到77.34（vs 71.06），推理时间比顺序提示减少90%以上。

Conclusion: Medal S通过协调空间精度与语义文本指导，在多类别医学分割任务中展现出卓越的效率和准确性，优于基于顺序提示的方法。

Abstract: We introduce Medal S, a medical segmentation foundation model that supports native-resolution spatial and textual prompts within an end-to-end trainable framework. Unlike text-only methods lacking spatial awareness, Medal S achieves channel-wise alignment between volumetric prompts and text embeddings, mitigating inaccuracies from resolution mismatches. By preserving full 3D context, it efficiently processes multiple native-resolution masks in parallel, enhancing multi-class segmentation performance. A lightweight 3D convolutional module enables precise voxel-space refinement guided by both prompt types, supporting up to 243 classes across CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and microscopy modalities in the BiomedSegFM dataset. Medal S offers two prompting modes: a text-only mode, where model predictions serve as spatial prompts for self-refinement without human input, and a hybrid mode, incorporating manual annotations for enhanced flexibility. For 24-class segmentation, parallel spatial prompting reduces inference time by more than 90% compared to sequential prompting. We propose dynamic resampling to address target-patch ratio imbalance, extending SAT and nnU-Net for data augmentation. Furthermore, we develop optimized text preprocessing, a two-stage inference strategy, and post-processing techniques to improve memory efficiency, precision, and inference speed. On the five-modality average on the validation set, Medal S outperforms SAT with a DSC of 75.44 (vs. 69.83), NSD of 77.34 (vs. 71.06), F1 of 38.24 (vs. 24.88), and DSC TP of 65.46 (vs. 46.97). Medal S achieves excellent performance by harmonizing spatial precision with semantic textual guidance, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy in multi-class medical segmentation tasks compared to sequential prompt-based approaches. Medal S will be publicly available at https://github.com/yinghemedical/Medal-S.

Abstract: We present Infinite-Story, a training-free framework for consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation tailored for multi-prompt storytelling scenarios. Built upon a scale-wise autoregressive model, our method addresses two key challenges in consistent T2I generation: identity inconsistency and style inconsistency. To overcome these issues, we introduce three complementary techniques: Identity Prompt Replacement, which mitigates context bias in text encoders to align identity attributes across prompts; and a unified attention guidance mechanism comprising Adaptive Style Injection and Synchronized Guidance Adaptation, which jointly enforce global style and identity appearance consistency while preserving prompt fidelity. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that require fine-tuning or suffer from slow inference, Infinite-Story operates entirely at test time, delivering high identity and style consistency across diverse prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art generation performance, while offering over 6X faster inference (1.72 seconds per image) than the existing fastest consistent T2I models, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world visual storytelling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAGE方法，通过引导式提示选择来缓解CLIP模型中的多模态伪相关偏差，无需训练、微调或外部标注，提升零样本分类的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等大视觉语言模型在零样本分类中常产生多模态伪相关偏差，即模型依赖虚假特征（如背景与物体的频繁共现）而非核心特征进行推断，这严重影响了模型在分布外数据上的鲁棒性。现有方法通常需要下游数据微调或先验偏差知识，破坏了CLIP的开箱即用性。

Method: 提出SAGE方法：首先理论分析多模态伪相关偏差对零样本分类的影响，然后通过引导式提示选择来缓解偏差。SAGE探索提示模板空间，选择能诱导类别间最大语义分离的提示，无需训练、微调或外部标注。

Result: 在四个真实世界基准数据集和五个流行骨干模型上的广泛实验表明，SAGE一致地提升了零样本性能和泛化能力，优于先前无需外部知识或模型更新的零样本方法。

Conclusion: SAGE是一种简单有效的零样本方法，能够缓解CLIP模型中的多模态伪相关偏差，提高最差组鲁棒性，同时保持模型的开箱即用特性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown strong zero-shot classification performance by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space. However, CLIP models often develop multimodal spurious biases, which is the undesirable tendency to rely on spurious features. For example, CLIP may infer object types in images based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather than the object's core features. This bias significantly impairs the robustness of pre-trained CLIP models on out-of-distribution data, where such cross-modal associations no longer hold. Existing methods for mitigating multimodal spurious bias typically require fine-tuning on downstream data or prior knowledge of the bias, which undermines the out-of-the-box usability of CLIP. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the impact of multimodal spurious bias in zero-shot classification. Based on this insight, we propose Spuriousness-Aware Guided Exploration (SAGE), a simple and effective method that mitigates spurious bias through guided prompt selection. SAGE requires no training, fine-tuning, or external annotations. It explores a space of prompt templates and selects the prompts that induce the largest semantic separation between classes, thereby improving worst-group robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets and five popular backbone models demonstrate that SAGE consistently improves zero-shot performance and generalization, outperforming previous zero-shot approaches without any external knowledge or model updates.

TL;DR: DTGS是一个统一框架，将Retinex启发的光照分解与热引导的3D高斯泼溅相结合，用于极低光照条件下的新视角合成，解决了标准3DGS在欠曝光输入下的几何和颜色不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极低光照条件下，新视角合成面临几何、颜色一致性和辐射稳定性的严重退化。标准3DGS直接应用于欠曝光输入时会失败，因为跨视图的独立增强会导致光照不一致和几何失真。

Method: DTGS通过循环增强-重建机制，在3DGS循环中嵌入Retinex分解模块，提供物理可解释的反射-光照分离。热监督分支通过动态平衡增强、结构和热损失来稳定颜色恢复和几何学习。

Result: 在新建的RGBT-LOW多视图低光热数据集上的广泛实验表明，DTGS显著优于现有的低光增强和3D重建基线方法，在极端光照条件下实现了优越的辐射一致性、几何保真度和颜色稳定性。

Conclusion: DTGS通过将光照分解与3D高斯泼溅紧密耦合，解决了极低光照条件下的新视角合成挑战，提供了物理可解释且一致的增强和重建结果。

Abstract: Under extremely low-light conditions, novel view synthesis (NVS) faces severe degradation in terms of geometry, color consistency, and radiometric stability. Standard 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipelines fail when applied directly to underexposed inputs, as independent enhancement across views causes illumination inconsistencies and geometric distortion. To address this, we present DTGS, a unified framework that tightly couples Retinex-inspired illumination decomposition with thermal-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for illumination-invariant reconstruction. Unlike prior approaches that treat enhancement as a pre-processing step, DTGS performs joint optimization across enhancement, geometry, and thermal supervision through a cyclic enhancement-reconstruction mechanism. A thermal supervisory branch stabilizes both color restoration and geometry learning by dynamically balancing enhancement, structural, and thermal losses. Moreover, a Retinex-based decomposition module embedded within the 3DGS loop provides physically interpretable reflectance-illumination separation, ensuring consistent color and texture across viewpoints. To evaluate our method, we construct RGBT-LOW, a new multi-view low-light thermal dataset capturing severe illumination degradation. Extensive experiments show that DTGS significantly outperforms existing low-light enhancement and 3D reconstruction baselines, achieving superior radiometric consistency, geometric fidelity, and color stability under extreme illumination.

Conclusion: 这是首个完全从反向传播角度为该任务设计的FPN架构，理论基础扎实，引入可忽略的计算开销，并能无缝集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is a key component of infrared search and tracking systems, yet it remains extremely challenging due to low signal-to-clutter ratios, severe target-background imbalance, and weak discriminative features. Existing deep learning methods primarily focus on spatio-temporal feature aggregation, but their gains are limited, revealing that the fundamental bottleneck lies in ambiguous per-frame feature representations rather than spatio-temporal modeling itself. Motivated by this insight, we propose BP-FPN, a backpropagation-driven feature pyramid architecture that fundamentally rethinks feature learning for small target. BP-FPN introduces Gradient-Isolated Low-Level Shortcut (GILS) to efficiently incorporate fine-grained target details without inducing shortcut learning, and Directional Gradient Regularization (DGR) to enforce hierarchical feature consistency during backpropagation. The design is theoretically grounded, introduces negligible computational overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing frameworks. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that BP-FPN consistently establishes new state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first FPN designed for this task entirely from the backpropagation perspective.

Conclusion: GeoUniPS通过整合几何先验和解决透视投影限制，显著提升了通用光度立体在复杂场景中的性能。

Abstract: Universal Photometric Stereo is a promising approach for recovering surface normals without strict lighting assumptions. However, it struggles when multi-illumination cues are unreliable, such as under biased lighting or in shadows or self-occluded regions of complex in-the-wild scenes. We propose GeoUniPS, a universal photometric stereo network that integrates synthetic supervision with high-level geometric priors from large-scale 3D reconstruction models pretrained on massive in-the-wild data. Our key insight is that these 3D reconstruction models serve as visual-geometry foundation models, inherently encoding rich geometric knowledge of real scenes. To leverage this, we design a Light-Geometry Dual-Branch Encoder that extracts both multi-illumination cues and geometric priors from the frozen 3D reconstruction model. We also address the limitations of the conventional orthographic projection assumption by introducing the PS-Perp dataset with realistic perspective projection to enable learning of spatially varying view directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUniPS delivers state-of-the-arts performance across multiple datasets, both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially in the complex in-the-wild scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MeanFlow在潜在空间中训练计算量大且不稳定，SD-VAE解码器在推理时成本高，且需要复杂的引导超参数进行类别条件生成。

Method: 在RAE潜在空间中使用一致性中期训练进行轨迹感知初始化，采用两阶段方案：从预训练流匹配教师蒸馏加速收敛，然后使用单点速度估计器进行可选的自举阶段。

Result: 在ImageNet 256上实现单步FID 2.03，优于原始MF的3.43，采样GFLOPS减少38%，总训练成本降低83%；在ImageNet 512上达到单步FID 3.23，在所有基线中GFLOPS最低。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了对引导的需求，简化了训练配置，在训练和采样中都减少了计算量，实现了高效的少步生成。

Abstract: MeanFlow (MF) is a diffusion-motivated generative model that enables efficient few-step generation by learning long jumps directly from noise to data. In practice, it is often used as a latent MF by leveraging the pre-trained Stable Diffusion variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for high-dimensional data modeling. However, MF training remains computationally demanding and is often unstable. During inference, the SD-VAE decoder dominates the generation cost, and MF depends on complex guidance hyperparameters for class-conditional generation. In this work, we develop an efficient training and sampling scheme for MF in the latent space of a Representation Autoencoder (RAE), where a pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., DINO) provides semantically rich latents paired with a lightweight decoder. We observe that naive MF training in the RAE latent space suffers from severe gradient explosion. To stabilize and accelerate training, we adopt Consistency Mid-Training for trajectory-aware initialization and use a two-stage scheme: distillation from a pre-trained flow matching teacher to speed convergence and reduce variance, followed by an optional bootstrapping stage with a one-point velocity estimator to further reduce deviation from the oracle mean flow. This design removes the need for guidance, simplifies training configurations, and reduces computation in both training and sampling. Empirically, our method achieves a 1-step FID of 2.03, outperforming vanilla MF's 3.43, while reducing sampling GFLOPS by 38% and total training cost by 83% on ImageNet 256. We further scale our approach to ImageNet 512, achieving a competitive 1-step FID of 3.23 with the lowest GFLOPS among all baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/sony/mf-rae.

Conclusion: 半监督域自适应是医疗高光谱成像的高效解决方案，SpectralAdapt框架有效缓解了域偏移、光谱退化和数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) holds great potential for healthcare due to its rich spectral information. However, acquiring HSI data remains costly and technically demanding. Hyperspectral image reconstruction offers a practical solution by recovering HSI data from accessible modalities, such as RGB. While general domain datasets are abundant, the scarcity of human HSI data limits progress in medical applications. To tackle this, we propose SpectralAdapt, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that bridges the domain gap between general and human-centered HSI datasets. To fully exploit limited labels and abundant unlabeled data, we enhance spectral reasoning by introducing Spectral Density Masking (SDM), which adaptively masks RGB channels based on their spectral complexity, encouraging recovery of informative regions from complementary cues during consistency training. Furthermore, we introduce Spectral Endmember Representation Alignment (SERA), which derives physically interpretable endmembers from valuable labeled pixels and employs them as domain-invariant anchors to guide unlabeled predictions, with momentum updates ensuring adaptability and stability. These components are seamlessly integrated into SpectralAdapt, a spectral prior-guided framework that effectively mitigates domain shift, spectral degradation, and data scarcity in HSI reconstruction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity, cross-domain generalization, and training stability, highlighting the promise of SSDA as an efficient solution for hyperspectral imaging in healthcare.

Motivation: 纯文本反思机制在长视频理解中存在局限性：(1)需要针对视觉信息的反思过程；(2)缺乏跨模态交互能力，无法充分整合视觉信息。

Method: 提出REVISOR框架，支持文本和视觉模态的协作反思过程，设计DADR奖励机制确保模型在强化学习中准确回顾与问题相关的视频片段。

Result: 在VideoMME、LongVideoBench、MLVU和LVBench四个基准测试中取得显著成果。

Conclusion: REVISOR框架显著增强了MLLMs的长视频理解能力，无需额外监督微调或外部模型。

Abstract: Self-reflection mechanisms that rely on purely text-based rethinking processes perform well in most multimodal tasks. However, when directly applied to long-form video understanding scenarios, they exhibit clear limitations. The fundamental reasons for this lie in two points: (1)long-form video understanding involves richer and more dynamic visual input, meaning rethinking only the text information is insufficient and necessitates a further rethinking process specifically targeting visual information; (2) purely text-based reflection mechanisms lack cross-modal interaction capabilities, preventing them from fully integrating visual information during reflection. Motivated by these insights, we propose REVISOR (REflective VIsual Segment Oriented Reasoning), a novel framework for tool-augmented multimodal reflection. REVISOR enables MLLMs to collaboratively construct introspective reflection processes across textual and visual modalities, significantly enhancing their reasoning capability for long-form video understanding. To ensure that REVISOR can learn to accurately review video segments highly relevant to the question during reinforcement learning, we designed the Dual Attribution Decoupled Reward (DADR) mechanism. Integrated into the GRPO training strategy, this mechanism enforces causal alignment between the model's reasoning and the selected video evidence. Notably, the REVISOR framework significantly enhances long-form video understanding capability of MLLMs without requiring supplementary supervised fine-tuning or external models, achieving impressive results on four benchmarks including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and LVBench.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has received growing attention due to its potential in autonomous driving. While most existing approaches follow an ego-centric paradigm by aggregating and diffusing features over the entire scene, they often overlook fine-grained object-level details, leading to semantic and geometric ambiguities, especially in complex environments. To address this limitation, we propose Ocean, an object-centric prediction framework that decomposes the scene into individual object instances to enable more accurate semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight segmentation model, MobileSAM, to extract instance masks from the input image. Then, we introduce a 3D Semantic Group Attention module that leverages linear attention to aggregate object-centric features in 3D space. To handle segmentation errors and missing instances, we further design a Global Similarity-Guided Attention module that leverages segmentation features for global interaction. Finally, we propose an Instance-aware Local Diffusion module that improves instance features through a generative process and subsequently refines the scene representation in the BEV space. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that Ocean achieves state-of-the-art performance, with mIoU scores of 17.40 and 20.28, respectively.

Result: 在三个代表性交互任务上的实验表明，Uni-Inter实现了竞争性性能，并能很好地泛化到新的实体组合。

Conclusion: 复合交互的统一建模为复杂环境中的可扩展运动合成提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present Uni-Inter, a unified framework for human motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction scenarios: including human-human, human-object, and human-scene-within a single, task-agnostic architecture. In contrast to existing methods that rely on task-specific designs and exhibit limited generalization, Uni-Inter introduces the Unified Interactive Volume (UIV), a volumetric representation that encodes heterogeneous interactive entities into a shared spatial field. This enables consistent relational reasoning and compound interaction modeling. Motion generation is formulated as joint-wise probabilistic prediction over the UIV, allowing the model to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies and produce coherent, context-aware behaviors. Experiments across three representative interaction tasks demonstrate that Uni-Inter achieves competitive performance and generalizes well to novel combinations of entities. These results suggest that unified modeling of compound interactions offers a promising direction for scalable motion synthesis in complex environments.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization across a wide range of visual tasks by leveraging large-scale English-image pairs. However, its extension to low-resource languages remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality multilingual image-text data. Existing multilingual vision-language models exhibit consistently low retrieval performance in underrepresented languages including Czech, Finnish, Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian on the Crossmodal-3600 (XM3600) benchmark. To address this, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient framework for multilingual vision-language alignment. Our approach requires no image-text pairs or text-text pairs and freezes both the pretrained image encoder and multilingual text encoder during training. Only a compact 1.7M-parameter projection module is trained, using a contrastive loss over English representations as semantic anchors. This minimal training setup enables robust multilingual alignment even for languages with limited supervision. Extensive evaluation across multiple multilingual retrieval benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of our method, showing significant gains in five underrepresented languages where existing models typically underperform. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our pivot-based, parameter-efficient alignment strategy for inclusive multimodal learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇时序动作定位方法大多在单一粒度上识别动作类别，这会降低基类和未知类动作的识别准确率。

Method: 构建包含定位器、动作存在预测器、常规分类器和粗到细分类器的多粒度类别感知网络，分别处理基类和未知类动作的识别。

Result: 在THUMOS'14和ActivityNet-1.3基准测试中达到最先进性能，在零样本时序动作定位设置下也取得最优结果。

Conclusion: 多粒度类别感知机制能有效提升开放词汇时序动作定位的性能，特别是在基类和未知类动作的识别上表现优异。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization (OV-TAL) aims to recognize and localize instances of any desired action categories in videos without explicitly curating training data for all categories. Existing methods mostly recognize action categories at a single granularity, which degrades the recognition accuracy of both base and novel action categories. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Grained Category-Aware Network (MGCA-Net) comprising a localizer, an action presence predictor, a conventional classifier, and a coarse-to-fine classifier. Specifically, the localizer localizes category-agnostic action proposals. For these action proposals, the action presence predictor estimates the probability that they belong to an action instance. At the same time, the conventional classifier predicts the probability of each action proposal over base action categories at the snippet granularity. Novel action categories are recognized by the coarse-to-fine classifier, which first identifies action presence at the video granularity. Finally, it assigns each action proposal to one category from the coarse categories at the proposal granularity. Through coarse-to-fine category awareness for novel actions and the conventional classifier's awareness of base actions, multi-grained category awareness is achieved, effectively enhancing localization performance. Comprehensive evaluations on the THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our MGCA-Net achieves state-of-the-art results under the Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization setting.

TL;DR: DiffPixelFormer是一种用于RGB-D室内场景分割的差分像素感知Transformer，通过增强模态内表示和建模模态间交互，解决了现有方法在特征对齐和判别表示方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-D融合中现有方法依赖计算密集型交叉注意力机制、模态内和模态间特征关系建模不足的问题，实现更精确的特征对齐和判别性表示。

Method: 提出Intra-Inter Modal Interaction Block (IIMIB)，通过自注意力捕获模态内长程依赖，使用Differential-Shared Inter-Modal (DSIM)模块建模模态间交互，分离模态特定和共享线索，实现像素级跨模态对齐。采用动态融合策略平衡模态贡献。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D和NYUDv2基准测试中，DiffPixelFormer-L分别达到54.28%和59.95%的mIoU分数，比DFormer-L分别高出1.78%和2.75%。

Conclusion: DiffPixelFormer通过同时增强模态内表示和建模模态间交互，有效提升了RGB-D室内场景分割的性能，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Indoor semantic segmentation is fundamental to computer vision and robotics, supporting applications such as autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and smart environments. Although RGB-D fusion leverages complementary appearance and geometric cues, existing methods often depend on computationally intensive cross-attention mechanisms and insufficiently model intra- and inter-modal feature relationships, resulting in imprecise feature alignment and limited discriminative representation. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPixelFormer, a differential pixel-aware Transformer for RGB-D indoor scene segmentation that simultaneously enhances intra-modal representations and models inter-modal interactions. At its core, the Intra-Inter Modal Interaction Block (IIMIB) captures intra-modal long-range dependencies via self-attention and models inter-modal interactions with the Differential-Shared Inter-Modal (DSIM) module to disentangle modality-specific and shared cues, enabling fine-grained, pixel-level cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, a dynamic fusion strategy balances modality contributions and fully exploits RGB-D information according to scene characteristics. Extensive experiments on the SUN RGB-D and NYUDv2 benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPixelFormer-L achieves mIoU scores of 54.28% and 59.95%, outperforming DFormer-L by 1.78% and 2.75%, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了Pretext-GRPO自监督强化学习算法和ViSS-R1框架，通过处理变换后的视觉输入和前置任务问题，增强多模态大语言模型对视频的视觉中心理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于R1的方法在视频任务中往往未能充分利用丰富的视觉信息，容易导致捷径学习和幻觉问题，需要更稳健的视觉中心视频理解方法。

Method: 首先提出Pretext-GRPO自监督强化学习算法，通过为正确解决变换视觉输入的前置任务分配正奖励；然后构建ViSS-R1框架，将前置任务自监督学习直接集成到MLLM的R1后训练范式中。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的视频推理和理解基准测试上进行了全面评估，证明了Pretext-GRPO和ViSS-R1在复杂视频推理方面的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过强制模型处理变换视觉输入并同时处理前置任务问题和真实用户查询，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的视频推理能力。

Abstract: Complex video reasoning remains a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as current R1-based methodologies often prioritize text-centric reasoning derived from text-based and image-based developments. In video tasks, such strategies frequently underutilize rich visual information, leading to potential shortcut learning and increased susceptibility to hallucination. To foster a more robust, visual-centric video understanding, we start by introducing a novel self-supervised reinforcement learning GRPO algorithm (Pretext-GRPO) within the standard R1 pipeline, in which positive rewards are assigned for correctly solving pretext tasks on transformed visual inputs, which makes the model to non-trivially process the visual information. Building on the effectiveness of Pretext-GRPO, we further propose the ViSS-R1 framework, which streamlines and integrates pretext-task-based self-supervised learning directly into the MLLM's R1 post-training paradigm. Instead of relying solely on sparse visual cues, our framework compels models to reason about transformed visual input by simultaneously processing both pretext questions (concerning transformations) and true user queries. This necessitates identifying the applied transformation and reconstructing the original video to formulate accurate final answers. Comprehensive evaluations on six widely-used video reasoning and understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our Pretext-GRPO and ViSS-R1 for complex video reasoning. Our codes and models will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 提出的MonoUnc方法有效建模了3D车道线检测中的随机不确定性，并通过新的3D高斯匹配损失和评估指标提升了性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is challenged by aleatoric uncertainty arising from inherent observation noise. Existing methods rely on simplified geometric assumptions, such as independent point predictions or global planar modeling, failing to capture structural variations and aleatoric uncertainty in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose MonoUnc, a bird's-eye view (BEV)-free 3D lane detector that explicitly models aleatoric uncertainty informed by local lane structures. Specifically, 3D lanes are projected onto the front-view (FV) space and approximated by parametric curves. Guided by curve predictions, curve-point query embeddings are dynamically generated for lane point predictions in 3D space. Each segment formed by two adjacent points is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, parameterized by the local structure and uncertainty estimations. Accordingly, a novel 3D Gaussian matching loss is designed to constrain these parameters jointly. Experiments on the ONCE-3DLanes and OpenLane datasets demonstrate that MonoUnc outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods across all benchmarks under stricter evaluation criteria. Additionally, we propose two comprehensive evaluation metrics for ONCE-3DLanes, calculating the average and maximum bidirectional Chamfer distances to quantify global and local errors.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of neural structures in Electron Microscopy (EM) images is paramount for neuroscience. However, this task is challenged by intricate morphologies, low signal-to-noise ratios, and scarce annotations, limiting the accuracy and generalization of existing methods. To address these challenges, we seek to leverage the priors learned by visual foundation models on a vast amount of natural images to better tackle this task. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that can effectively transfer knowledge from Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), which is pre-trained on natural images, to the EM domain. We first use SAM2 to extract powerful, general-purpose features. To bridge the domain gap, we introduce a Feature-Guided Attention module that leverages semantic cues from SAM2 to guide a lightweight encoder, the Fine-Grained Encoder (FGE), in focusing on these challenging regions. Finally, a dual-affinity decoder generates both coarse and refined affinity maps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches with the SAM2 weights frozen. Upon further fine-tuning on EM data, our method significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods. This study validates that transferring representations pre-trained on natural images, when combined with targeted domain-adaptive guidance, can effectively address the specific challenges in neuron segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有步态识别方法在受控数据集上表现良好，但缺乏对真实世界干扰和轮廓变化的系统性鲁棒性评估。

Method: 开发RobustGait评估框架，包含15种干扰类型、5个严重级别，在多个数据集上评估6种最先进的步态识别系统，分析扰动类型、轮廓提取方法、模型架构和部署场景的影响。

Result: 发现RGB级别噪声能更好反映真实世界退化；步态识别对轮廓提取器偏差高度敏感；鲁棒性取决于扰动类型和架构设计；噪声感知训练和知识蒸馏能提升性能。

Conclusion: 步态识别系统的鲁棒性评估至关重要，噪声感知训练和知识蒸馏是提升部署就绪系统的有效策略。

Abstract: Appearance-based gait recognition have achieved strong performance on controlled datasets, yet systematic evaluation of its robustness to real-world corruptions and silhouette variability remains lacking. We present RobustGait, a framework for fine-grained robustness evaluation of appearance-based gait recognition systems. RobustGait evaluation spans four dimensions: the type of perturbation (digital, environmental, temporal, occlusion), the silhouette extraction method (segmentation and parsing networks), the architectural capacities of gait recognition models, and various deployment scenarios. The benchmark introduces 15 corruption types at 5 severity levels across CASIA-B, CCPG, and SUSTech1K, with in-the-wild validation on MEVID, and evaluates six state-of-the-art gait systems. We came across several exciting insights. First, applying noise at the RGB level better reflects real-world degradation, and reveal how distortions propagate through silhouette extraction to the downstream gait recognition systems. Second, gait accuracy is highly sensitive to silhouette extractor biases, revealing an overlooked source of benchmark bias. Third, robustness is dependent on both the type of perturbation and the architectural design. Finally, we explore robustness-enhancing strategies, showing that noise-aware training and knowledge distillation improve performance and move toward deployment-ready systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AdaptiveAD架构，通过双分支结构解耦场景感知和自车状态，解决现有端到端自动驾驶系统过度依赖自车状态的问题，提升泛化能力和场景理解鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模块化规划导向的自动驾驶架构过度依赖自车状态，导致泛化能力受限和场景理解不鲁棒。根本原因是自车状态在BEV编码器中过早融合，使得这个强先验信息主导下游规划模块。

Method: 采用多上下文融合策略的双分支架构：一个分支基于多任务学习进行场景驱动推理（BEV编码器中故意省略自车状态），另一个分支仅基于规划任务进行自车驱动推理。通过场景感知融合模块自适应整合两个分支的互补决策。引入路径注意力机制进行自车-BEV交互，并添加BEV单向蒸馏和自回归在线映射两个辅助任务。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的广泛评估表明，AdaptiveAD实现了最先进的开环规划性能，显著减轻了对自车状态的过度依赖，并在多样化场景中展现出令人印象深刻的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AdaptiveAD通过架构层面的解决方案有效解决了端到端自动驾驶系统中过度依赖自车状态的问题，提升了系统的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modular design of planning-oriented autonomous driving has markedly advanced end-to-end systems. However, existing architectures remain constrained by an over-reliance on ego status, hindering generalization and robust scene understanding. We identify the root cause as an inherent design within these architectures that allows ego status to be easily leveraged as a shortcut. Specifically, the premature fusion of ego status in the upstream BEV encoder allows an information flow from this strong prior to dominate the downstream planning module. To address this challenge, we propose AdaptiveAD, an architectural-level solution based on a multi-context fusion strategy. Its core is a dual-branch structure that explicitly decouples scene perception and ego status. One branch performs scene-driven reasoning based on multi-task learning, but with ego status deliberately omitted from the BEV encoder, while the other conducts ego-driven reasoning based solely on the planning task. A scene-aware fusion module then adaptively integrates the complementary decisions from the two branches to form the final planning trajectory. To ensure this decoupling does not compromise multi-task learning, we introduce a path attention mechanism for ego-BEV interaction and add two targeted auxiliary tasks: BEV unidirectional distillation and autoregressive online mapping. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that AdaptiveAD achieves state-of-the-art open-loop planning performance. Crucially, it significantly mitigates the over-reliance on ego status and exhibits impressive generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了RFxG分类法来统一理解显著性图解释的目的，通过参考框架和粒度两个维度组织解释方法，并开发了新的评估指标来系统评估解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性图在深度学习视觉解释中广泛使用，但对其预期目的和与用户查询的一致性缺乏共识，这种模糊性阻碍了解释方法的有效评估和实际效用。

Method: 引入参考框架×粒度（RFxG）分类法，将显著性解释沿两个轴组织：参考框架（点式vs对比式）和粒度（细粒度类级vs粗粒度组级）。提出了四个新的忠实度指标来系统评估解释质量。

Result: 通过RFxG视角揭示了现有评估指标的局限性，这些指标主要关注点式忠实度而忽略对比推理和语义粒度。对10种最先进的显著性方法、4种模型架构和3个数据集进行了全面评估。

Conclusion: 通过倡导向用户意图驱动的评估转变，为开发不仅忠实于底层模型行为，而且与人类理解和查询复杂性有意义对齐的视觉解释提供了概念基础和实践工具。

Abstract: Saliency maps are widely used for visual explanations in deep learning, but a fundamental lack of consensus persists regarding their intended purpose and alignment with diverse user queries. This ambiguity hinders the effective evaluation and practical utility of explanation methods.We address this gap by introducing the Reference-Frame $\times$ Granularity (RFxG) taxonomy, a principled conceptual framework that organizes saliency explanations along two essential axes:Reference-Frame: Distinguishing between pointwise ("Why this prediction?") and contrastive ("Why this and not an alternative?") explanations.Granularity: Ranging from fine-grained class-level (e.g., "Why Husky?") to coarse-grained group-level (e.g., "Why Dog?") interpretations.Using the RFxG lens, we demonstrate critical limitations in existing evaluation metrics, which overwhelmingly prioritize pointwise faithfulness while neglecting contrastive reasoning and semantic granularity. To systematically assess explanation quality across both RFxG dimensions, we propose four novel faithfulness metrics. Our comprehensive evaluation framework applies these metrics to ten state-of-the-art saliency methods, four model architectures, and three datasets.By advocating a shift toward user-intent-driven evaluation, our work provides both the conceptual foundation and the practical tools necessary to develop visual explanations that are not only faithful to the underlying model behavior but are also meaningfully aligned with the complexity of human understanding and inquiry.

Conclusion: MergeSlide是一个简单有效的终身学习框架，通过模型合并和提示对齐推理，在保持性能的同时缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Lifelong learning on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) aims to train or fine-tune a unified model sequentially on cancer-related tasks, reducing the resources and effort required for data transfer and processing, especially given the gigabyte-scale size of WSIs. In this paper, we introduce MergeSlide, a simple yet effective framework that treats lifelong learning as a model merging problem by leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new task arrives, it is: 1) defined with class-aware prompts, 2) fine-tuned for a few epochs using an MLP-free backbone, and 3) merged into a unified model using an orthogonal continual merging strategy that preserves performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. For inference under the class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) setting, where task identity is unknown, we introduce Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference. Specifically, TCP first identifies the most relevant task using task-level prompts and then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts to generate predictions. To evaluate MergeSlide, we conduct experiments on a stream of six TCGA datasets. The results show that MergeSlide outperforms both rehearsal-based continual learning and vision-language zero-shot baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有类别无关姿态估计方法使用固定文本关键点描述作为语义先验，但存在两个固有局限：(1)多义词导致的跨类别歧义（如'腿'在人类和家具中的不同视觉表现），(2)对细粒度类内变化区分性不足（如不同姿态和毛色的猫）。

Method: 提出新框架，创新性地整合层次化跨模态交互与双流特征精炼，利用文本描述和具体图像的类别级和实例特定线索增强关节嵌入。

Result: 在MP-100数据集上的实验表明，无论使用何种网络骨干，CapeNext始终以较大优势超越最先进的CAPE方法。

Conclusion: 通过动态融合文本和视觉信息，CapeNext有效解决了静态关节嵌入的局限性，为类别无关姿态估计提供了更鲁棒和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research in Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) has adopted fixed textual keypoint description as semantic prior for two-stage pose matching frameworks. While this paradigm enhances robustness and flexibility by disentangling the dependency of support images, our critical analysis reveals two inherent limitations of static joint embedding: (1) polysemy-induced cross-category ambiguity during the matching process(e.g., the concept "leg" exhibiting divergent visual manifestations across humans and furniture), and (2) insufficient discriminability for fine-grained intra-category variations (e.g., posture and fur discrepancies between a sleeping white cat and a standing black cat). To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework that innovatively integrates hierarchical cross-modal interaction with dual-stream feature refinement, enhancing the joint embedding with both class-level and instance-specific cues from textual description and specific images. Experiments on the MP-100 dataset demonstrate that, regardless of the network backbone, CapeNext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CAPE methods by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界跟踪场景同时包含线性和非线性运动模式，但现有方法要么使用计算高效的卡尔曼滤波器（无法处理非线性运动），要么使用数据驱动预测器（计算开销大且泛化能力有限）。

Method: 提出PlugTrack框架，通过多感知运动理解自适应融合卡尔曼滤波器和数据驱动运动预测器，生成自适应混合因子而不修改现有运动预测器。

Result: 在MOT17/MOT20上取得显著性能提升，在DanceTrack上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PlugTrack是首个通过自适应融合桥接经典与现代运动预测范式的多目标跟踪框架，有效利用了两种方法的互补优势。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) predominantly follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm, where Kalman filters serve as the standard motion predictor due to computational efficiency but inherently fail on non-linear motion patterns. Conversely, recent data-driven motion predictors capture complex non-linear dynamics but suffer from limited domain generalization and computational overhead. Through extensive analysis, we reveal that even in datasets dominated by non-linear motion, Kalman filter outperforms data-driven predictors in up to 34\% of cases, demonstrating that real-world tracking scenarios inherently involve both linear and non-linear patterns. To leverage this complementarity, we propose PlugTrack, a novel framework that adaptively fuses Kalman filter and data-driven motion predictors through multi-perceptive motion understanding. Our approach employs multi-perceptive motion analysis to generate adaptive blending factors. PlugTrack achieves significant performance gains on MOT17/MOT20 and state-of-the-art on DanceTrack without modifying existing motion predictors. To the best of our knowledge, PlugTrack is the first framework to bridge classical and modern motion prediction paradigms through adaptive fusion in MOT.

However, the substantial training and storage costs associated with these datasets hinder their practical deployment. While dataset distillation (DD) can alleviate these burdens, existing methods mainly target high-level tasks, where multiple samples share the same label. This many-to-one mapping allows distilled data to capture shared semantics and achieve information compression. In contrast, low-level tasks involve a many-to-many mapping that requires pixel-level fidelity, making low-level DD an underdetermined problem, as a small distilled dataset cannot fully constrain the dense pixel-level mappings. To address this, we propose the first low-level DD method for medical image enhancement. We first leverage anatomical similarities across patients to construct the shared anatomical prior based on a representative patient, which serves as the initialization for the distilled data of different patients. This prior is then personalized for each patient using a Structure-Preserving Personalized Generation (SPG) module, which integrates patient-specific anatomical information into the distilled dataset while preserving pixel-level fidelity. For different low-level tasks, the distilled data is used to construct task-specific high- and low-quality training pairs. Patient-specific knowledge is injected into the distilled data by aligning the gradients computed from networks trained on the distilled pairs with those from the corresponding patient's raw data. Notably, downstream users cannot access raw patient data. Instead, only a distilled dataset containing abstract training information is shared, which excludes patient-specific details and thus preserves privacy.

Motivation: 生成模型（如GANs和扩散模型）的快速发展导致AI生成图像广泛传播，引发了关于错误信息、隐私侵犯和数字媒体信任侵蚀的担忧。虽然多模态模型如CLIP提供了强大的可迁移表示用于检测合成内容，但微调往往会导致灾难性遗忘，降低预训练先验并限制跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DGS-Net通过梯度空间分解有效解决了微调多模态模型时的灾难性遗忘问题，在AI生成图像检测任务中实现了优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models such as GANs and diffusion models has led to the widespread proliferation of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation, privacy violations, and trust erosion in digital media. Although large-scale multimodal models like CLIP offer strong transferable representations for detecting synthetic content, fine-tuning them often induces catastrophic forgetting, which degrades pre-trained priors and limits cross-domain generalization. To address this issue, we propose the Distillation-guided Gradient Surgery Network (DGS-Net), a novel framework that preserves transferable pre-trained priors while suppressing task-irrelevant components. Specifically, we introduce a gradient-space decomposition that separates harmful and beneficial descent directions during optimization. By projecting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of harmful directions and aligning with beneficial ones distilled from a frozen CLIP encoder, DGS-Net achieves unified optimization of prior preservation and irrelevant suppression. Extensive experiments on 50 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by an average margin of 6.6, achieving superior detection performance and generalization across diverse generation techniques.

Abstract: Image dehazing is an important task in the field of computer vision, aiming at restoring clear and detail-rich visual content from haze-affected images. However, when dealing with complex scenes, existing methods often struggle to strike a balance between fine-grained feature representation of inhomogeneous haze distribution and global consistency modeling. Furthermore, to better learn the common degenerate representation of haze in spatial variations, we propose an unsupervised dehaze method for implicit neural degradation representation. Firstly, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose a mechanism combining the channel-independent and channel-dependent mechanisms, which efficiently enhances the ability to learn from nonlinear dependencies. which in turn achieves good visual perception in complex scenes. Moreover, we design an implicit neural representation to model haze degradation as a continuous function to eliminate redundant information and the dependence on explicit feature extraction and physical models. To further learn the implicit representation of the haze features, we also designed a dense residual enhancement module from it to eliminate redundant information. This achieves high-quality image restoration. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive dehaze performance on various public and real-world datasets. This project code will be available at https://github.com/Fan-pixel/NeDR-Dehaze.

Abstract: Rain significantly degrades the performance of computer vision systems, particularly in applications like autonomous driving and video surveillance. While existing deraining methods have made considerable progress, they often struggle with fidelity of semantic and spatial details. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Prior Hierarchical Mamba (MPHM) network for image deraining. This novel architecture synergistically integrates macro-semantic textual priors (CLIP) for task-level semantic guidance and micro-structural visual priors (DINOv2) for scene-aware structural information. To alleviate potential conflicts between heterogeneous priors, we devise a progressive Priors Fusion Injection (PFI) that strategically injects complementary cues at different decoder levels. Meanwhile, we equip the backbone network with an elaborate Hierarchical Mamba Module (HMM) to facilitate robust feature representation, featuring a Fourier-enhanced dual-path design that concurrently addresses global context modeling and local detail recovery. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MPHM's state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 0.57 dB PSNR gain on the Rain200H dataset while delivering superior generalization on real-world rainy scenarios.

Conclusion: RIF框架通过旋转不变特征有效解决了点云方向和位置变化的问题，在3D异常检测任务中表现出优越性能，具有工业应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (AD) is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to identify anomalous points or regions from point cloud data. However, existing methods may encounter challenges when handling point clouds with changes in orientation and position because the resulting features may vary significantly. To address this problem, we propose a novel Rotationally Invariant Features (RIF) framework for 3D AD. Firstly, to remove the adverse effect of variations on point cloud data, we develop a Point Coordinate Mapping (PCM) technique, which maps each point into a rotationally invariant space to maintain consistency of representation. Then, to learn robust and discriminative features, we design a lightweight Convolutional Transform Feature Network (CTF-Net) to extract rotationally invariant features for the memory bank. To improve the ability of the feature extractor, we introduce the idea of transfer learning to pre-train the feature extractor with 3D data augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the advanced performance on the Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset, with an average P-AUROC improvement of 17.7\%, and also gains the best performance on the Real3D-AD dataset, with an average P-AUROC improvement of 1.6\%. The strong generalization ability of RIF has been verified by combining it with traditional feature extraction methods on anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating great potential for industrial applications.

Conclusion: CloseUpShot通过改进的条件机制和全局几何约束，有效解决了特写场景中稀疏输入的新视图合成问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views from sparse input views is a highly challenging task. Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong temporal reasoning capabilities, making them a promising tool for enhancing reconstruction quality under sparse-view settings. However, existing approaches are primarily designed for modest viewpoint variations, which struggle in capturing fine-grained details in close-up scenarios since input information is severely limited. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based framework, called CloseUpShot, for close-up novel view synthesis from sparse inputs via point-conditioned video diffusion. Specifically, we observe that pixel-warping conditioning suffers from severe sparsity and background leakage in close-up settings. To address this, we propose hierarchical warping and occlusion-aware noise suppression, enhancing the quality and completeness of the conditioning images for the video diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce global structure guidance, which leverages a dense fused point cloud to provide consistent geometric context to the diffusion process, to compensate for the lack of globally consistent 3D constraints in sparse conditioning inputs. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, especially in close-up novel view synthesis, clearly validating the effectiveness of our design.

Motivation: 现有学习方法虽然降低了轨迹相似性计算的计算复杂度，但未能充分利用轨迹信息的全面谱系进行相似性建模。

Method: 提出RePo方法：1）区域级表示：将GPS轨迹映射为网格序列，通过结构特征和视觉特征增强的语义上下文捕捉空间上下文；2）点级表示：使用三个轻量级专家网络从密集GPS序列中提取局部、相关性和连续移动模式；3）通过路由器网络自适应融合点级特征，再与区域级特征通过交叉注意力结合生成最终轨迹嵌入；4）使用带有困难负样本的对比损失进行训练。

Conclusion: RePo通过联合编码区域级和点级特征，有效捕捉了轨迹的空间上下文和细粒度移动模式，显著提升了轨迹相似性计算的性能。

Abstract: Recent learning-based methods have reduced the computational complexity of traditional trajectory similarity computation, but state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods still fail to leverage the comprehensive spectrum of trajectory information for similarity modeling. To tackle this problem, we propose \textbf{RePo}, a novel method that jointly encodes \textbf{Re}gion-wise and \textbf{Po}int-wise features to capture both spatial context and fine-grained moving patterns. For region-wise representation, the GPS trajectories are first mapped to grid sequences, and spatial context are captured by structural features and semantic context enriched by visual features. For point-wise representation, three lightweight expert networks extract local, correlation, and continuous movement patterns from dense GPS sequences. Then, a router network adaptively fuses the learned point-wise features, which are subsequently combined with region-wise features using cross-attention to produce the final trajectory embedding. To train RePo, we adopt a contrastive loss with hard negative samples to provide similarity ranking supervision. Experiment results show that RePo achieves an average accuracy improvement of 22.2\% over SOTA baselines across all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: VEIL框架揭示了文本到视频模型的安全盲点，表明看似良性的提示可以通过利用跨模态关联模式成功诱导模型生成不安全内容。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks can circumvent model safety guardrails and reveal critical blind spots. Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models.

Motivation: 现有对抗评估通常依赖于在室内环境中很少遇到的异常纹理扰动，这些人为条件下的错误在实际应用中相关性有限。室内照明作为内在但被忽视的场景属性，对导航有重要影响。

Method: 提出了ILA黑盒框架，包括两种攻击模式：SILA（静态室内照明攻击，光照强度恒定）和DILA（动态室内照明攻击，在关键时刻开关灯以引发突然的光照变化）。

Result: 在两个最先进的VLN模型和三个导航任务上的评估显示，ILA显著提高了失败率并降低了轨迹效率，揭示了VLN代理对现实室内光照变化的前所未有的脆弱性。

Conclusion: ILA框架揭示了VLN代理对现实室内光照变化的脆弱性，表明现有模型在应对日常光照变化方面存在严重不足，需要改进模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents have made remarkable progress, but their robustness remains insufficiently studied. Existing adversarial evaluations often rely on perturbations that manifest as unusual textures rarely encountered in everyday indoor environments. Errors under such contrived conditions have limited practical relevance, as real-world agents are unlikely to encounter such artificial patterns. In this work, we focus on indoor lighting, an intrinsic yet largely overlooked scene attribute that strongly influences navigation. We propose Indoor Lighting-based Adversarial Attack (ILA), a black-box framework that manipulates global illumination to disrupt VLN agents. Motivated by typical household lighting usage, we design two attack modes: Static Indoor Lighting-based Attack (SILA), where the lighting intensity remains constant throughout an episode, and Dynamic Indoor Lighting-based Attack (DILA), where lights are switched on or off at critical moments to induce abrupt illumination changes. We evaluate ILA on two state-of-the-art VLN models across three navigation tasks. Results show that ILA significantly increases failure rates while reducing trajectory efficiency, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities of VLN agents to realistic indoor lighting variations.

Conclusion: MedGEN-Bench通过上下文交织的指令和开放式生成输出，推进了医学AI研究，超越了传统多项选择题的限制。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) increasingly gain traction in medical applications, clinicians are progressively expecting AI systems not only to generate textual diagnoses but also to produce corresponding medical images that integrate seamlessly into authentic clinical workflows. Despite the growing interest, existing medical visual benchmarks present notable limitations. They often rely on ambiguous queries that lack sufficient relevance to image content, oversimplify complex diagnostic reasoning into closed-ended shortcuts, and adopt a text-centric evaluation paradigm that overlooks the importance of image generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{MedGEN-Bench}, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to advance medical AI research. MedGEN-Bench comprises 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs spanning six imaging modalities, 16 clinical tasks, and 28 subtasks. It is structured into three distinct formats: Visual Question Answering, Image Editing, and Contextual Multimodal Generation. What sets MedGEN-Bench apart is its focus on contextually intertwined instructions that necessitate sophisticated cross-modal reasoning and open-ended generative outputs, moving beyond the constraints of multiple-choice formats. To evaluate the performance of existing systems, we employ a novel three-tier assessment framework that integrates pixel-level metrics, semantic text analysis, and expert-guided clinical relevance scoring. Using this framework, we systematically assess 10 compositional frameworks, 3 unified models, and 5 VLMs.

Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法难以同时最大化计算效率和捕获长距离空间依赖关系，而基于Mamba的模型虽然能以较低成本捕获长距离依赖，但现有方法依赖固定窗口内的轴对齐扫描，不可避免地丢弃了空间信息。

Method: 提出WinMamba块组成的Mamba-based 3D特征编码主干，包含窗口尺度自适应模块来补偿不同分辨率下的体素特征，以及带有可学习位置编码和窗口移位策略的WinMamba层来在线性状态空间中获取丰富的上下文线索。

Conclusion: WinMamba通过创新的窗口尺度自适应和窗口移位策略，成功解决了3D目标检测中效率与长距离依赖捕获的平衡问题，为自动驾驶场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection is critical for autonomous driving, yet it remains fundamentally challenging to simultaneously maximize computational efficiency and capture long-range spatial dependencies. We observed that Mamba-based models, with their linear state-space design, capture long-range dependencies at lower cost, offering a promising balance between efficiency and accuracy. However, existing methods rely on axis-aligned scanning within a fixed window, inevitably discarding spatial information. To address this problem, we propose WinMamba, a novel Mamba-based 3D feature-encoding backbone composed of stacked WinMamba blocks. To enhance the backbone with robust multi-scale representation, the WinMamba block incorporates a window-scale-adaptive module that compensates voxel features across varying resolutions during sampling. Meanwhile, to obtain rich contextual cues within the linear state space, we equip the WinMamba layer with a learnable positional encoding and a window-shift strategy. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that WinMamba significantly outperforms the baseline. Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of the WSF and AWF modules in improving detection accuracy. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded Americas infrastructure condition as a C, with the road system receiving a dismal D. Roads are vital to regional economic viability, yet their management, maintenance, and repair processes remain inefficient, relying on outdated manual or laser-based inspection methods that are both costly and time-consuming. With the increasing availability of real-time visual data from autonomous vehicles, there is an opportunity to apply computer vision (CV) methods for advanced road monitoring, providing insights to guide infrastructure rehabilitation efforts. This project explores the use of state-of-the-art CV techniques for road distress segmentation. It begins by evaluating synthetic data generated with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to assess its usefulness for model training. The study then applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for road distress segmentation and subsequently examines the transformer-based model MaskFormer. Results show that GAN-generated data improves model performance and that MaskFormer outperforms the CNN model in two metrics: mAP50 and IoU.

TL;DR: CSIP-ReID是首个基于骨架的预训练框架，通过对比学习对齐骨架和视觉特征，结合原型融合更新器和骨架引导时序建模，在视频行人重识别任务中取得SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的多模态预训练方法存在两个根本限制：缺乏真正的多模态预训练，以及文本无法捕捉细粒度时序运动信息。骨架数据能提供与视频帧对齐的时空信息模态。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用对比学习在序列级别对齐骨架和视觉特征；第二阶段引入动态原型融合更新器（PFU）来优化多模态身份原型，融合运动和外观线索；还提出骨架引导时序建模（SGTM）模块从骨架数据中提取时序线索并整合到视觉特征中。

Result: 在标准视频ReID基准测试（MARS、LS-VID、iLIDS-VID）上达到新的SOTA结果；在纯骨架ReID任务（BIWI、IAS）上表现出强大的泛化能力，显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CSIP-ReID开创了无标注和运动感知的ReID预训练范式，为多模态表示学习开辟了新前沿。

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining has revolutionized visual understanding, but its impact on video-based person re-identification (ReID) remains underexplored. Existing approaches often rely on video-text pairs, yet suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) lack of genuine multimodal pretraining, and (2) text poorly captures fine-grained temporal motion-an essential cue for distinguishing identities in video. In this work, we take a bold departure from text-based paradigms by introducing the first skeleton-driven pretraining framework for ReID. To achieve this, we propose Contrastive Skeleton-Image Pretraining for ReID (CSIP-ReID), a novel two-stage method that leverages skeleton sequences as a spatiotemporally informative modality aligned with video frames. In the first stage, we employ contrastive learning to align skeleton and visual features at sequence level. In the second stage, we introduce a dynamic Prototype Fusion Updater (PFU) to refine multimodal identity prototypes, fusing motion and appearance cues. Moreover, we propose a Skeleton Guided Temporal Modeling (SGTM) module that distills temporal cues from skeleton data and integrates them into visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSIP-ReID achieves new state-of-the-art results on standard video ReID benchmarks (MARS, LS-VID, iLIDS-VID). Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization to skeleton-only ReID tasks (BIWI, IAS), significantly outperforming previous methods. CSIP-ReID pioneers an annotation-free and motion-aware pretraining paradigm for ReID, opening a new frontier in multimodal representation learning.

Result: 在SEN1-2数据集上CMR@1px提升12.29%，在GFGE_SO数据集上提升18.50%。SOMA表现出强鲁棒性，在不同场景和分辨率下泛化良好。

Conclusion: SOMA通过有效利用梯度信息和混合匹配策略，显著提升了SAR-光学图像的配准性能，证明了结构梯度先验在跨模态配准中的重要性。

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level registration between SAR and optical images remains a challenging task due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms and visual characteristics. Although deep learning has achieved great success in many cross-modal tasks, its performance on SAR-Optical registration tasks is still unsatisfactory. Gradient-based information has traditionally played a crucial role in handcrafted descriptors by highlighting structural differences. However, such gradient cues have not been effectively leveraged in deep learning frameworks for SAR-Optical image matching. To address this gap, we propose SOMA, a dense registration framework that integrates structural gradient priors into deep features and refines alignment through a hybrid matching strategy. Specifically, we introduce the Feature Gradient Enhancer (FGE), which embeds multi-scale, multi-directional gradient filters into the feature space using attention and reconstruction mechanisms to boost feature distinctiveness. Furthermore, we propose the Global-Local Affine-Flow Matcher (GLAM), which combines affine transformation and flow-based refinement within a coarse-to-fine architecture to ensure both structural consistency and local accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SOMA significantly improves registration precision, increasing the CMR@1px by 12.29% on the SEN1-2 dataset and 18.50% on the GFGE_SO dataset. In addition, SOMA exhibits strong robustness and generalizes well across diverse scenes and resolutions.

Abstract: According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer claimed the lives of approximately 685,000 women in 2020. Early diagnosis and accurate clinical decision making are critical in reducing this global burden. In this study, we propose THIR, a novel Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) framework that leverages topological data analysis specifically, Betti numbers derived from persistent homology to characterize and retrieve histopathological images based on their intrinsic structural patterns. Unlike conventional deep learning approaches that rely on extensive training, annotated datasets, and powerful GPU resources, THIR operates entirely without supervision. It extracts topological fingerprints directly from RGB histopathological images using cubical persistence, encoding the evolution of loops as compact, interpretable feature vectors. The similarity retrieval is then performed by computing the distances between these topological descriptors, efficiently returning the top-K most relevant matches.
  Extensive experiments on the BreaKHis dataset demonstrate that THIR outperforms state of the art supervised and unsupervised methods. It processes the entire dataset in under 20 minutes on a standard CPU, offering a fast, scalable, and training free solution for clinical image retrieval.

Conclusion: HDW-SR通过小波域的高频引导机制有效解决了扩散模型在超分辨率中的细节模糊问题，为高质量图像重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have shown great promise in single image super-resolution (SISR); however, existing approaches often produce blurred fine details due to insufficient guidance in the high-frequency domain. To address this issue, we propose a High-Frequency Guided Diffusion Network based on Wavelet Decomposition (HDW-SR), which replaces the conventional U-Net backbone in diffusion frameworks. Specifically, we perform diffusion only on the residual map, allowing the network to focus more effectively on high-frequency information restoration. We then introduce wavelet-based downsampling in place of standard CNN downsampling to achieve multi-scale frequency decomposition, enabling sparse cross-attention between the high-frequency subbands of the pre-super-resolved image and the low-frequency subbands of the diffused image for explicit high-frequency guidance. Moreover, a Dynamic Thresholding Block (DTB) is designed to refine high-frequency selection during the sparse attention process. During upsampling, the invertibility of the wavelet transform ensures low-loss feature reconstruction. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that HDW-SR achieves competitive super-resolution performance, excelling particularly in recovering fine-grained image details. The code will be available after acceptance.

Motivation: 现有的局部纤维束追踪方法容易产生误差累积和高假阳性率，而全局方法计算成本高昂。需要一种既能保持高精度又能在低分辨率噪声数据中保持可靠性的解决方案。

Method: 将纤维束追踪构建为生成任务，学习从dMRI到完整流线的直接映射，比较了基于扩散和流匹配的两种生成范式。

Conclusion: GenTract在保持研究级数据高精度的同时，在低分辨率数据中也保持可靠性，是全局纤维束追踪的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Tractography is the process of inferring the trajectories of white-matter pathways in the brain from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). Local tractography methods, which construct streamlines by following local fiber orientation estimates stepwise through an image, are prone to error accumulation and high false positive rates, particularly on noisy or low-resolution data. In contrast, global methods, which attempt to optimize a collection of streamlines to maximize compatibility with underlying fiber orientation estimates, are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we introduce GenTract, the first generative model for global tractography. We frame tractography as a generative task, learning a direct mapping from dMRI to complete, anatomically plausible streamlines. We compare both diffusion-based and flow matching paradigms and evaluate GenTract's performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, GenTract achieves precision 2.1x higher than the next-best method, TractOracle. This advantage becomes even more pronounced in challenging low-resolution and noisy settings, where it outperforms the closest competitor by an order of magnitude. By producing tractograms with high precision on research-grade data while also maintaining reliability on imperfect, lower-resolution data, GenTract represents a promising solution for global tractography.

Conclusion: 视觉信息和大型解码器模型在XMC中发挥关键作用，ViXML框架有效结合两者，在保持效率的同时显著提升性能，证明了图像的价值相当于数十亿参数。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence across numerous domains, yet their transformative potential remains largely untapped in Extreme Multi-label Classification (XMC). Queries in XMC are associated with relevant labels from extremely large label spaces, where it is critical to strike a balance between efficiency and performance. Therefore, many recent approaches efficiently pose XMC as a maximum inner product search between embeddings learned from small encoder-only transformer architectures. In this paper, we address two important aspects in XMC: how to effectively harness larger decoder-only models, and how to exploit visual information while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate that both play a critical role in XMC separately and can be combined for improved performance. We show that a few billion-size decoder can deliver substantial improvements while keeping computational overhead manageable. Furthermore, our Vision-enhanced eXtreme Multi-label Learning framework (ViXML) efficiently integrates foundation vision models by pooling a single embedding per image. This limits computational growth while unlocking multi-modal capabilities. Remarkably, ViXML with small encoders outperforms text-only decoder in most cases, showing that an image is worth billions of parameters. Finally, we present an extension of existing text-only datasets to exploit visual metadata and make them available for future benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments across four public text-only datasets and their corresponding image enhanced versions validate our proposals' effectiveness, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by up to +8.21\% in P@1 on the largest dataset.

Conclusion: OCR方法能有效提升多模态大语言模型的视频空间推理能力，通过结构化扰动3D几何实现更全面的场景理解

Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding. However, enabling robust video spatial reasoning-the ability to comprehend object locations, orientations, and inter-object relationships in dynamic 3D scenes-remains a key unsolved challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on spatially grounded supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, yet we observe that such models often exhibit query-locked reasoning, focusing narrowly on objects explicitly mentioned in the prompt while ignoring critical contextual cues. To address this limitation, we propose Object-Centric 3D Rollout (OCR), a novel strategy that introduces structured perturbations to the 3D geometry of selected objects during training. By degrading object-specific visual cues and projecting the altered geometry into 2D space, OCR compels the model to reason holistically across the entire scene. We further design a rollout-based training pipeline that jointly leverages vanilla and region-noisy videos to optimize spatial reasoning trajectories. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: our 3B-parameter model achieves 47.5% accuracy on VSI-Bench, outperforming several 7B baselines. Ablations confirm OCR's superiority over prior rollout strategies (e.g., T-GRPO, NoisyRollout).

Abstract: Painting embodies a unique form of visual storytelling, where the creation process is as significant as the final artwork. Although recent advances in generative models have enabled visually compelling painting synthesis, most existing methods focus solely on final image generation or patch-based process simulation, lacking explicit stroke structure and failing to produce smooth, realistic shading. In this work, we present a differentiable stroke reconstruction framework that unifies painting, stylized texturing, and smudging to faithfully reproduce the human painting-smudging loop. Given an input image, our framework first optimizes single- and dual-color Bezier strokes through a parallel differentiable paint renderer, followed by a style generation module that synthesizes geometry-conditioned textures across diverse painting styles. We further introduce a differentiable smudge operator to enable natural color blending and shading. Coupled with a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy, our method jointly optimizes stroke geometry, color, and texture under geometric and semantic guidance. Extensive experiments on oil, watercolor, ink, and digital paintings demonstrate that our approach produces realistic and expressive stroke reconstructions, smooth tonal transitions, and richly stylized appearances, offering a unified model for expressive digital painting creation.

TL;DR: MonoDLGD是一个基于难度感知标签引导去噪的单目3D目标检测框架，通过自适应扰动和重建真实标签来提供几何监督，在KITTI基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测由于深度线索的固有模糊性而存在根本性问题，现有DETR方法虽然通过全局注意力和辅助深度预测来缓解，但仍受限于不准确的深度估计，且忽略了实例级检测难度（如遮挡、距离、截断）对检测性能的影响。

Method: 提出难度感知标签引导去噪框架，根据检测不确定性自适应扰动和重建真实标签：对简单实例施加更强扰动，对困难实例施加较弱扰动，然后重建标签以提供明确的几何监督。通过联合优化标签重建和3D目标检测，促进几何感知表示学习。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MonoDLGD在所有难度级别上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MonoDLGD通过难度感知的标签去噪策略有效提升了单目3D目标检测的性能，特别是在处理不同复杂度的对象时表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is a cost-effective solution for applications like autonomous driving and robotics, but remains fundamentally ill-posed due to inherently ambiguous depth cues. Recent DETR-based methods attempt to mitigate this through global attention and auxiliary depth prediction, yet they still struggle with inaccurate depth estimates. Moreover, these methods often overlook instance-level detection difficulty, such as occlusion, distance, and truncation, leading to suboptimal detection performance. We propose MonoDLGD, a novel Difficulty-Aware Label-Guided Denoising framework that adaptively perturbs and reconstructs ground-truth labels based on detection uncertainty. Specifically, MonoDLGD applies stronger perturbations to easier instances and weaker ones into harder cases, and then reconstructs them to effectively provide explicit geometric supervision. By jointly optimizing label reconstruction and 3D object detection, MonoDLGD encourages geometry-aware representation learning and improves robustness to varying levels of object complexity. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that MonoDLGD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all difficulty levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将异常事件视为单一类别，忽略了真实世界中异常事件多样的语义和时间特性。受人类感知异常方式的启发，需要同时理解时间运动模式和不同异常类型的语义结构。

Method: 包含两个核心模块：MoTAR模块通过运动感知时间注意力估计运动显著性并动态调整时间关注；CORE模块通过跨注意力将片段级特征与可学习的类别原型对齐，注入软异常类别先验。

Result: 在WVAD基准测试上的广泛实验验证了RefineVAD的有效性，并强调了整合语义上下文来引导特征细化朝向异常相关模式的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过联合利用时间动态和语义结构，RefineVAD能够显式建模运动如何演化以及它类似于什么语义类别，提升了弱监督视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection aims to identify anomalous events using only video-level labels, balancing annotation efficiency with practical applicability. However, existing methods often oversimplify the anomaly space by treating all abnormal events as a single category, overlooking the diverse semantic and temporal characteristics intrinsic to real-world anomalies. Inspired by how humans perceive anomalies, by jointly interpreting temporal motion patterns and semantic structures underlying different anomaly types, we propose RefineVAD, a novel framework that mimics this dual-process reasoning. Our framework integrates two core modules. The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both "how" motion evolves and "what" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns.

Conclusion: PAVE-Net是首个用于多帧2D人体姿态估计的端到端方法，有效解决了跨帧个体关联问题，在准确性和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Existing multi-person video pose estimation methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline: detecting individuals in each frame, followed by temporal modeling for single-person pose estimation. This design relies on heuristic operations such as detection, RoI cropping, and non-maximum suppression (NMS), limiting both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end framework for multi-person 2D pose estimation in videos, effectively eliminating heuristic operations. A key challenge is to associate individuals across frames under complex and overlapping temporal trajectories. To address this, we introduce a novel Pose-Aware Video transformEr Network (PAVE-Net), which features a spatial encoder to model intra-frame relations and a spatiotemporal pose decoder to capture global dependencies across frames. To achieve accurate temporal association, we propose a pose-aware attention mechanism that enables each pose query to selectively aggregate features corresponding to the same individual across consecutive frames.Additionally, we explicitly model spatiotemporal dependencies among pose keypoints to improve accuracy. Notably, our approach is the first end-to-end method for multi-frame 2D human pose estimation.Extensive experiments show that PAVE-Net substantially outperforms prior image-based end-to-end methods, achieving a \textbf{6.0} mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017, and delivers accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art two-stage video-based approaches, while offering significant gains in efficiency.Project page: https://github.com/zgspose/PAVENet

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in 3D-text cross-modal alignment, existing state-of-the-art methods still struggle to align fine-grained textual semantics with detailed geometric structures, and their alignment performance degrades significantly when scaling to large-scale 3D databases. To overcome this limitation, we introduce 3DAlign-DAER, a unified framework designed to align text and 3D geometry via the proposed dynamic attention policy and the efficient retrieval strategy, capturing subtle correspondences for diverse cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks. Specifically, during the training, our proposed dynamic attention policy (DAP) employs the Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HAF) module to represent the alignment as learnable fine-grained token-to-point attentions. To optimize these attentions across different tasks and geometric hierarchies, our DAP further exploits the Monte Carlo tree search to dynamically calibrate HAF attention weights via a hybrid reward signal and further enhances the alignment between textual descriptions and local 3D geometry. During the inference, our 3DAlign-DAER introduces an Efficient Retrieval Strategy (ERS) to leverage efficient hierarchical searching in the large-scale embedding spaces, outperforming traditional methods (e.g., KNN) in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, to facilitate text-3D alignment research and train our 3DAlign-DAER, we construct Align3D-2M, a large-scale dataset featuring 2M text-3D pairs, to provide sufficient fine-grained cross-modal annotations. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our 3DAlign-DAER on diverse benchmarks. We will release our codes, models, and datasets.

Abstract: Appearance-based gaze estimation, aiming to predict accurate 3D gaze direction from a single facial image, has made promising progress in recent years. However, most methods suffer significant performance degradation in cross-domain evaluation due to interference from gaze-irrelevant factors, such as expressions, wearables, and image quality. To alleviate this problem, we present a novel Hybrid-domain Adaptative Representation Learning (shorted by HARL) framework that exploits multi-source hybrid datasets to learn robust gaze representation. More specifically, we propose to disentangle gaze-relevant representation from low-quality facial images by aligning features extracted from high-quality near-eye images in an unsupervised domain-adaptation manner, which hardly requires any computational or inference costs. Additionally, we analyze the effect of head-pose and design a simple yet efficient sparse graph fusion module to explore the geometric constraint between gaze direction and head-pose, leading to a dense and robust gaze representation. Extensive experiments on EyeDiap, MPIIFaceGaze, and Gaze360 datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of $\textbf{5.02}^{\circ}$ and $\textbf{3.36}^{\circ}$, and $\textbf{9.26}^{\circ}$ respectively, and present competitive performances through cross-dataset evaluation.

Abstract: Portable ultra-low-field MRI (uLF-MRI, 0.064 T) offers accessible neuroimaging for neonatal care but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and poor diagnostic quality compared to high-field (HF) MRI. We propose MRIQT, a 3D conditional diffusion framework for image quality transfer (IQT) from uLF to HF MRI. MRIQT combines realistic K-space degradation for physics-consistent uLF simulation, v-prediction with classifier-free guidance for stable image-to-image generation, and an SNR-weighted 3D perceptual loss for anatomical fidelity. The model denoises from a noised uLF input conditioned on the same scan, leveraging volumetric attention-UNet architecture for structure-preserving translation. Trained on a neonatal cohort with diverse pathologies, MRIQT surpasses recent GAN and CNN baselines in PSNR 15.3% with 1.78% over the state of the art, while physicians rated 85% of its outputs as good quality with clear pathology present. MRIQT enables high-fidelity, diffusion-based enhancement of portable ultra-low-field (uLF) MRI for deliable neonatal brain assessment.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation floods on various social media, and continues to evolve in the era of AI-generated content (AIGC). The emerged misinformation with low creation cost and high deception poses significant threats to society. While recent studies leverage general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve remarkable results in detection, they encounter two critical limitations: (1) Insufficient reasoning, where general-purpose MLLMs often follow the uniform reasoning paradigm but generate inaccurate explanations and judgments, due to the lack of the task-specific knowledge of multimodal misinformation detection. (2) Reasoning biases, where a single thinking mode make detectors a suboptimal path for judgment, struggling to keep pace with the fast-growing and intricate multimodal misinformation. In this paper, we propose MMD-Thinker, a two-stage framework for multimodal misinformation detection through adaptive multi-dimensional thinking. First, we develop tailor-designed thinking mode for multimodal misinformation detection. Second, we adopt task-specific instruction tuning to inject the tailored thinking mode into general-purpose MLLMs. Third, we further leverage reinforcement learning strategy with a mixed advantage function, which incentivizes the reasoning capabilities in trajectories. Furthermore, we construct the multimodal misinformation reasoning (MMR) dataset, encompasses more than 8K image-text pairs with both reasoning processes and classification labels, to make progress in the relam of multimodal misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MMD-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmark datasets, while maintaining flexible inference and token usage. Code will be publicly available at Github.

Motivation: 现有的Ref-COD方法将参考显著图像转换为一维提示，但未能充分利用参考图像中丰富的显著特征和伪装目标特征的多上下文融合潜力。

Method: 提出RFMNet，在编码阶段进行参考显著图像特征与伪装特征的多阶段交互融合；设计重叠窗口交叉注意力机制关注局部信息匹配；使用参考特征聚合模块进行渐进式解码分割。

Result: 在Ref-COD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过多阶段特征融合和局部注意力机制，RFMNet能够有效利用参考信息提升伪装目标检测性能。

Abstract: Referring camouflaged object detection (Ref-COD) aims to identify hidden objects by incorporating reference information such as images and text descriptions. Previous research has transformed reference images with salient objects into one-dimensional prompts, yielding significant results. We explore ways to enhance performance through multi-context fusion of rich salient image features and camouflaged object features. Therefore, we propose RFMNet, which utilizes features from multiple encoding stages of the reference salient images and performs interactive fusion with the camouflage features at the corresponding encoding stages. Given that the features in salient object images contain abundant object-related detail information, performing feature fusion within local areas is more beneficial for detecting camouflaged objects. Therefore, we propose an Overlapped Windows Cross-attention mechanism to enable the model to focus more attention on the local information matching based on reference features. Besides, we propose the Referring Feature Aggregation (RFA) module to decode and segment the camouflaged objects progressively. Extensive experiments on the Ref-COD benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, however their knowledge and abilities in the cross-view geo-localization and pose estimation domains remain unexplored, despite potential benefits for navigation, autonomous driving, outdoor robotics, \textit{etc}. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{GeoX-Bench}, a comprehensive \underline{Bench}mark designed to explore and evaluate the capabilities of LMMs in \underline{cross}-view \underline{Geo}-localization and pose estimation. Specifically, GeoX-Bench contains 10,859 panoramic-satellite image pairs spanning 128 cities in 49 countries, along with corresponding 755,976 question-answering (QA) pairs. Among these, 42,900 QA pairs are designated for benchmarking, while the remaining are intended to enhance the capabilities of LMMs. Based on GeoX-Bench, we evaluate the capabilities of 25 state-of-the-art LMMs on cross-view geo-localization and pose estimation tasks, and further explore the empowered capabilities of instruction-tuning. Our benchmark demonstrate that while current LMMs achieve impressive performance in geo-localization tasks, their effectiveness declines significantly on the more complex pose estimation tasks, highlighting a critical area for future improvement, and instruction-tuning LMMs on the training data of GeoX-Bench can significantly improve the cross-view geo-sense abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术在渲染速度和真实感方面表现出色，但其内存占用随场景复杂度快速增长，现有压缩方法主要利用基元级冗余进行压缩，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出SymGS框架，引入可学习镜像来识别和消除局部和全局的反射对称冗余，可作为即插即用模块增强现有压缩方法（如HAC）。

Result: 相比HAC方法，在基准数据集上实现1.66倍压缩（大规模场景可达3倍），平均实现108倍压缩，同时保持渲染质量。

Conclusion: SymGS通过对称感知技术有效突破了现有压缩方法的极限，为3D高斯泼溅提供了高效的内存压缩解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a transformative technique in novel view synthesis, primarily due to its high rendering speed and photorealistic fidelity. However, its memory footprint scales rapidly with scene complexity, often reaching several gigabytes. Existing methods address this issue by introducing compression strategies that exploit primitive-level redundancy through similarity detection and quantization. We aim to surpass the compression limits of such methods by incorporating symmetry-aware techniques, specifically targeting mirror symmetries to eliminate redundant primitives. We propose a novel compression framework, \textbf{\textit{SymGS}}, introducing learnable mirrors into the scene, thereby eliminating local and global reflective redundancies for compression. Our framework functions as a plug-and-play enhancement to state-of-the-art compression methods, (e.g. HAC) to achieve further compression. Compared to HAC, we achieve $1.66 \times$ compression across benchmark datasets (upto $3\times$ on large-scale scenes). On an average, SymGS enables $\bf{108\times}$ compression of a 3DGS scene, while preserving rendering quality.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), leveraging their powerful visual perception and reasoning capabilities, have been widely applied in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tasks. However, the spatial intelligence capabilities of existing VLMs in UAV scenarios remain largely unexplored, raising concerns about their effectiveness in navigating and interpreting dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpatialSky-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial intelligence capabilities of VLMs in UAV navigation. Our benchmark comprises two categories-Environmental Perception and Scene Understanding-divided into 13 subcategories, including bounding boxes, color, distance, height, and landing safety analysis, among others. Extensive evaluations of various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal unsatisfactory performance in complex UAV navigation scenarios, highlighting significant gaps in their spatial capabilities. To address this challenge, we developed the SpatialSky-Dataset, a comprehensive dataset containing 1M samples with diverse annotations across various scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we introduce Sky-VLM, a specialized VLM designed for UAV spatial reasoning across multiple granularities and contexts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Sky-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all benchmark tasks, paving the way for the development of VLMs suitable for UAV scenarios.

Conclusion: SF-Recon方法能够直接从多视角图像重建轻量级、结构保真的建筑网格，避免了传统流程中的后处理简化步骤。

Abstract: Lightweight building surface models are crucial for digital city, navigation, and fast geospatial analytics, yet conventional multi-view geometry pipelines remain cumbersome and quality-sensitive due to their reliance on dense reconstruction, meshing, and subsequent simplification. This work presents SF-Recon, a method that directly reconstructs lightweight building surfaces from multi-view images without post-hoc mesh simplification. We first train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) field to obtain a view-consistent representation. Building structure is then distilled by a normal-gradient-guided Gaussian optimization that selects primitives aligned with roof and wall boundaries, followed by multi-view edge-consistency pruning to enhance structural sharpness and suppress non-structural artifacts without external supervision. Finally, a multi-view depth-constrained Delaunay triangulation converts the structured Gaussian field into a lightweight, structurally faithful building mesh. Based on a proposed SF dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that our SF-Recon can directly reconstruct lightweight building models from multi-view imagery, achieving substantially fewer faces and vertices while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的野外人体网格伪真值生成流程是单人中心的，缺乏场景级一致性，导致同一图像中个体深度和尺度冲突。

Method: 引入深度条件平移优化(DTO)方法，通过利用人体高度先验和单目深度估计器的深度线索，在MAP框架下联合优化所有个体的相机空间平移；提出Metric-Aware HMR端到端网络，直接估计度量尺度的人体网格和相机参数。

Conclusion: DTO方法有效解决了多人场景中的深度和尺度一致性问题，Metric-Aware HMR网络实现了度量尺度的人体网格恢复，为多人人体姿态估计提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Multi-person human mesh recovery from a single image is a challenging task, hindered by the scarcity of in-the-wild training data. Prevailing in-the-wild human mesh pseudo-ground-truth (pGT) generation pipelines are single-person-centric, where each human is processed individually without joint optimization. This oversight leads to a lack of scene-level consistency, producing individuals with conflicting depths and scales within the same image. To address this, we introduce Depth-conditioned Translation Optimization (DTO), a novel optimization-based method that jointly refines the camera-space translations of all individuals in a crowd. By leveraging anthropometric priors on human height and depth cues from a monocular depth estimator, DTO solves for a scene-consistent placement of all subjects within a principled Maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. Applying DTO to the 4D-Humans dataset, we construct DTO-Humans, a new large-scale pGT dataset of 0.56M high-quality, scene-consistent multi-person images, featuring dense crowds with an average of 4.8 persons per image. Furthermore, we propose Metric-Aware HMR, an end-to-end network that directly estimates human mesh and camera parameters in metric scale. This is enabled by a camera branch and a novel relative metric loss that enforces plausible relative scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on relative depth reasoning and human mesh recovery. Code and data will be released publicly.

Conclusion: TabFlash通过生成信息丰富且紧凑的视觉特征，有效解决了表格图像理解中的效率和效果问题。

Abstract: Table images present unique challenges for effective and efficient understanding due to the need for question-specific focus and the presence of redundant background regions. Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) approaches often overlook these characteristics, resulting in uninformative and redundant visual representations. To address these issues, we aim to generate visual features that are both informative and compact to improve table understanding. We first propose progressive question conditioning, which injects the question into Vision Transformer layers with gradually increasing frequency, considering each layer's capacity to handle additional information, to generate question-aware visual features. To reduce redundancy, we introduce a pruning strategy that discards background tokens, thereby improving efficiency. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we further propose token focusing, a training strategy that encourages the model to concentrate essential information in the retained tokens. By combining these approaches, we present TabFlash, an efficient and effective MLLM for table understanding. TabFlash achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary MLLMs, while requiring 27% less FLOPs and 30% less memory usage compared to the second-best MLLM.

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了通用图像编辑与专业级字体设计之间的差距，为专业设计工作流程提供了强大的文本编辑工具。

Abstract: Artistic design such as poster design often demands rapid yet precise modification of textual content while preserving visual harmony and typographic intent, especially across diverse font styles. Although modern image editing models have grown increasingly powerful, they still fall short in fine-grained, font-aware text manipulation, limiting their utility in professional design workflows such as poster editing. To address this issue, we present SkyReels-Text, a novel font-controllable framework for precise poster text editing. Our method enables simultaneous editing of multiple text regions, each rendered in distinct typographic styles, while preserving the visual appearance of non-edited regions. Notably, our model requires neither font labels nor fine-tuning during inference: users can simply provide cropped glyph patches corresponding to their desired typography, even if the font is not included in any standard library. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including handwrittent text benchmarks, SkyReels-Text achieves state-of-the-art performance in both text fidelity and visual realism, offering unprecedented control over font families, and stylistic nuances. This work bridges the gap between general-purpose image editing and professional-grade typographic design.

Abstract: End-to-end planning methods are the de facto standard of the current autonomous driving system, while the robustness of the data-driven approaches suffers due to the notorious long-tail problem (i.e., rare but safety-critical failure cases). In this work, we explore whether recent diffusion-based video generation methods (a.k.a. world models), paired with structured 3D layouts, can enable a fully automated pipeline to self-correct such failure cases. We first introduce an agent to simulate the role of product manager, dubbed PM-Agent, which formulates data requirements to collect data similar to the failure cases. Then, we use a generative model that can simulate both data collection and annotation. However, existing generative models struggle to generate high-fidelity data conditioned on 3D layouts. To address this, we propose DriveSora, which can generate spatiotemporally consistent videos aligned with the 3D annotations requested by PM-Agent. We integrate these components into our self-correcting agentic system, CorrectAD. Importantly, our pipeline is an end-to-end model-agnostic and can be applied to improve any end-to-end planner. Evaluated on both nuScenes and a more challenging in-house dataset across multiple end-to-end planners, CorrectAD corrects 62.5% and 49.8% of failure cases, reducing collision rates by 39% and 27%, respectively.

Abstract: The generation of realistic LiDAR point clouds plays a crucial role in the development and evaluation of autonomous driving systems. Although recent methods for 3D LiDAR point cloud generation have shown significant improvements, they still face notable limitations, including the lack of sequential generation capabilities and the inability to produce accurately positioned foreground objects and realistic backgrounds.

In this paper, we introduce DriveLiDAR4D, a novel LiDAR generation pipeline consisting of multimodal conditions and a novel sequential noise prediction model LiDAR4DNet, capable of producing temporally consistent LiDAR scenes with highly controllable foreground objects and realistic backgrounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the sequential generation of LiDAR scenes with full scene manipulation capability in an end-to-end manner. We evaluated DriveLiDAR4D on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets, where we achieved an FRD score of 743.13 and an FVD score of 16.96 on the nuScenes dataset, surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, UniScene, with an performance boost of 37.2% in FRD and 24.1% in FVD, respectively.

Abstract: Group activity detection in multi-person scenes is challenging due to complex human interactions, occlusions, and variations in appearance over time. This work presents a computer vision based framework for group activity recognition and action spotting using a combination of deep learning models and graph based relational reasoning. The system first applies Mask R-CNN to obtain accurate actor localization through bounding boxes and instance masks. Multiple backbone networks, including Inception V3, MobileNet, and VGG16, are used to extract feature maps, and RoIAlign is applied to preserve spatial alignment when generating actor specific features. The mask information is then fused with the feature maps to obtain refined masked feature representations for each actor. To model interactions between individuals, we construct Actor Relation Graphs that encode appearance similarity and positional relations using methods such as normalized cross correlation, sum of absolute differences, and dot product. Graph Convolutional Networks operate on these graphs to reason about relationships and predict both individual actions and group level activities. Experiments on the Collective Activity dataset demonstrate that the combination of mask based feature refinement, robust similarity search, and graph neural network reasoning leads to improved recognition performance across both crowded and non crowded scenarios. This approach highlights the potential of integrating segmentation, feature extraction, and relational graph reasoning for complex video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种混合半监督学习方法，结合整体质量的人工标签和质量细节的伪标签，在多任务框架下改进视网膜图像质量评估，无需大量手动标注即可获得更可解释的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视网膜图像质量评估工具大多只分类整体图像质量，无法指示采集缺陷来指导重新拍摄，主要原因是详细标注成本高昂。

Method: 使用在小型数据集上训练的教师模型生成伪标签，然后在多任务设置中微调预训练模型，采用ResNet-18骨干网络。

Result: 多任务模型在EyeQ数据集上F1得分0.875（vs. 0.863单任务），在DeepDRiD数据集上0.778（vs. 0.763单任务），性能与现有方法相当或更好，在大多数细节预测任务中与教师模型性能统计相当。

Conclusion: 提出的半监督方法不仅改进了整体质量评估，还提供了关于采集条件（光照、清晰度、对比度）的可解释反馈，以无额外手动标注成本增强可解释性，并提供临床可操作的输出来指导图像重新拍摄。

Abstract: Retinal image quality assessment (RIQA) supports computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases. However, most tools classify only overall image quality, without indicating acquisition defects to guide recapture. This gap is mainly due to the high cost of detailed annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this limitation by introducing a hybrid semi-supervised learning approach that combines manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels of quality details within a multi-task framework. Our objective is to obtain more interpretable RIQA models without requiring extensive manual labeling. Pseudo-labels are generated by a Teacher model trained on a small dataset and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model in a multi-task setting. Using a ResNet-18 backbone, we show that these weak annotations improve quality assessment over single-task baselines (F1: 0.875 vs. 0.863 on EyeQ, and 0.778 vs. 0.763 on DeepDRiD), matching or surpassing existing methods. The multi-task model achieved performance statistically comparable to the Teacher for most detail prediction tasks (p > 0.05). In a newly annotated EyeQ subset released with this paper, our model performed similarly to experts, suggesting that pseudo-label noise aligns with expert variability. Our main finding is that the proposed semi-supervised approach not only improves overall quality assessment but also provides interpretable feedback on capture conditions (illumination, clarity, contrast). This enhances interpretability at no extra manual labeling cost and offers clinically actionable outputs to guide image recapture.

Conclusion: gDDCM有效扩展了DDCM的应用范围，使其能够适用于主流扩散模型及其变体，在图像压缩任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, the Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCM) was proposed. DDCM leverages the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and replaces the random noise in the backward process with noise sampled from specific sets according to a predefined rule, thereby enabling image compression. However, DDCM cannot be applied to methods other than DDPM. In this paper, we propose the generalized Denoising Diffusion Compression Model (gDDCM), which extends DDCM to mainstream diffusion models and their variants, including DDPM, Score-Based Models, Consistency Models, and Rectified Flow. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10 and LSUN Bedroom datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully generalizes DDCM to the aforementioned models and achieves improved performance.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法在可编辑属性解耦方面存在不足，通常只能编辑文本内容，限制了可控性和视觉一致性。

Method: 提出TripleFDS框架和SCB Synthesis数据集，使用SCB Group作为基本训练单元，通过组间对比正则化和组内多特征正交性实现三特征解耦，并在合成阶段进行特征重映射以防止重建中的"捷径"现象。

Result: 在125,000个SCB Groups上训练后，TripleFDS在主流STE基准测试中达到44.54的SSIM和93.58%的文本准确率，并支持样式替换和背景转移等新操作。

Conclusion: TripleFDS通过三特征解耦实现了更灵活和视觉一致的场景文本编辑，在图像保真度和文本准确性方面都达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) aims to naturally modify text in images while preserving visual consistency, the decisive factors of which can be divided into three parts, i.e., text style, text content, and background. Previous methods have struggled with incomplete disentanglement of editable attributes, typically addressing only one aspect - such as editing text content - thus limiting controllability and visual consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose TripleFDS, a novel framework for STE with disentangled modular attributes, and an accompanying dataset called SCB Synthesis. SCB Synthesis provides robust training data for triple feature disentanglement by utilizing the "SCB Group", a novel construct that combines three attributes per image to generate diverse, disentangled training groups. Leveraging this construct as a basic training unit, TripleFDS first disentangles triple features, ensuring semantic accuracy through inter-group contrastive regularization and reducing redundancy through intra-sample multi-feature orthogonality. In the synthesis phase, TripleFDS performs feature remapping to prevent "shortcut" phenomena during reconstruction and mitigate potential feature leakage. Trained on 125,000 SCB Groups, TripleFDS achieves state-of-the-art image fidelity (SSIM of 44.54) and text accuracy (ACC of 93.58%) on the mainstream STE benchmarks. Besides superior performance, the more flexible editing of TripleFDS supports new operations such as style replacement and background transfer. Code: https://github.com/yusenbao01/TripleFDS

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Models, numerous text-and-vision-fused Multimodal Large Models (MLMs) have emerged. However, these MLMs remain susceptible to informational interference in visual perception, particularly in color perception, which introduces an additional risk of hallucination. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the "What Color Is It" dataset, a novel benchmark constructed using a simple method to trigger single-modality visual hallucination in MLMs. Based on this dataset, we further investigate the underlying causes of hallucination in the visual modality of MLMs and propose potential solutions to enhance their robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有农田边界提取方法存在边界不完整、相邻农田合并、难以扩展等问题，需要开发可扩展的准确农田边界制图方法。

Method: 使用基于YOLOv11的DelAny实例分割模型，在FBIS 22M数据集上训练，结合结构化后处理、合并和矢量化流程生成矢量边界。

Result: DelAny模型比SAM2准确率提高100%以上，推理速度快400倍；在乌克兰识别出375万(5m分辨率)和515万(2.5m分辨率)个农田，显著优于现有产品。

Conclusion: DelAnyFlow为缺乏数字地籍数据的地区提供了可扩展、经济高效的农田边界制图方法。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of agricultural field boundaries from satellite imagery is essential for land management and crop monitoring, yet existing methods often produce incomplete boundaries, merge adjacent fields, and struggle to scale. We present the Delineate Anything Flow (DelAnyFlow) methodology, a resolution-agnostic approach for large-scale field boundary mapping. DelAnyFlow combines the DelAny instance segmentation model, based on a YOLOv11 backbone and trained on the large-scale Field Boundary Instance Segmentation-22M (FBIS 22M) dataset, with a structured post-processing, merging, and vectorization sequence to generate topologically consistent vector boundaries. FBIS 22M, the largest dataset of its kind, contains 672,909 multi-resolution image patches (0.25-10m) and 22.9million validated field instances. The DelAny model delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with over 100% higher mAP and 400x faster inference than SAM2. DelAny demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and supports national-scale applications: using Sentinel 2 data for 2024, DelAnyFlow generated a complete field boundary layer for Ukraine (603,000km2) in under six hours on a single workstation. DelAnyFlow outputs significantly improve boundary completeness relative to operational products from Sinergise Solutions and NASA Harvest, particularly in smallholder and fragmented systems (0.25-1ha). For Ukraine, DelAnyFlow delineated 3.75M fields at 5m and 5.15M at 2.5m, compared to 2.66M detected by Sinergise Solutions and 1.69M by NASA Harvest. This work delivers a scalable, cost-effective methodology for field delineation in regions lacking digital cadastral data.

TL;DR: 提出了VOPE方法，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在自愿想象任务中的幻觉问题，发现现有模型在想象任务中普遍存在严重幻觉，且现有缓解方法效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注禁止输出图像中不存在内容的事实描述任务，而忽略了自愿想象任务（如故事创作）中的幻觉问题，这些任务期望模型生成超越给定图像的新内容。

Method: 提出了VOPE方法，通过提出重新检查式问题来评估LVLM如何解释其响应中想象对象的存在性，利用模型解释与图像中对象存在性的一致性来判断幻觉。

Result: 应用VOPE评估多个主流LVLM和幻觉缓解方法发现：(1)大多数LVLM在自愿想象时严重幻觉，对想象对象的存在性评估表现差；(2)现有幻觉缓解方法在自愿想象任务中效果有限。

Conclusion: 自愿想象任务中的幻觉问题是一个重要研究方向，现有方法对此类任务效果不佳，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Most research on hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) focuses on factual description tasks that prohibit any output absent from the image. However, little attention has been paid to hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks, e.g., story writing, where the models are expected to generate novel content beyond the given image. In these tasks, it is inappropriate to simply regard such imagined novel content as hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce Voluntary-imagined Object Presence Evaluation (VOPE)-a novel method to assess LVLMs' hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks via presence evaluation. Specifically, VOPE poses recheck-based questions to evaluate how an LVLM interprets the presence of the imagined objects in its own response. The consistency between the model's interpretation and the object's presence in the image is then used to determine whether the model hallucinates when generating the response. We apply VOPE to several mainstream LVLMs and hallucination mitigation methods, revealing two key findings: (1) most LVLMs hallucinate heavily during voluntary imagination, and their performance in presence evaluation is notably poor on imagined objects; (2) existing hallucination mitigation methods show limited effect in voluntary imagination tasks, making this an important direction for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可逆且模态无关的形状映射表示，在多种3D形状处理任务中表现优异，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel neural representation for maps between 3D shapes based on flow-matching models, which is computationally efficient and supports cross-representation shape matching without large-scale training or data-driven procedures. 3D shapes are represented as the probability distribution induced by a continuous and invertible flow mapping from a fixed anchor distribution. Given a source and a target shape, the composition of the inverse flow (source to anchor) with the forward flow (anchor to target), we continuously map points between the two surfaces. By encoding the shapes with a pointwise task-tailored embedding, this construction provides an invertible and modality-agnostic representation of maps between shapes across point clouds, meshes, signed distance fields (SDFs), and volumetric data. The resulting representation consistently achieves high coverage and accuracy across diverse benchmarks and challenging settings in shape matching. Beyond shape matching, our framework shows promising results in other tasks, including UV mapping and registration of raw point cloud scans of human bodies.

Conclusion: Foresee无需额外训练即可实现轻量级推理，在定位精度和解释丰富性方面超越现有MLLM方法，具有强大的跨篡改类型泛化能力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, image generation and manipulation have become remarkably effortless. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version.

TL;DR: SliDer是一个使用视觉语言模型将幻灯片图像转换为可编辑SVG格式的框架，解决了现有几何光栅矢量化方法无法保持文档高层结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多媒体文档（如幻灯片和海报）通常以静态光栅格式分发，限制了编辑和定制。现有方法无法保持文档的高层语义结构，导致图像和文本元素的语义区分丢失。

Method: SliDer使用视觉语言模型检测和提取光栅输入中的图像和文本元素属性，将其组织成连贯的SVG格式，并通过迭代推理过程优化预测，类似于人类设计过程。

Result: SliDer实现了0.069的重建LPIPS分数，在82.9%的情况下被人类评估者认为优于最强的零样本VLM基线。

Conclusion: SliDer能够有效地将幻灯片图像转换为紧凑且可编辑的SVG表示，为语义文档反渲染提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimedia documents such as slide presentations and posters are designed to be interactive and easy to modify. Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成人类交互时往往无法保持独特的个体特征或完全遵循文本描述，这限制了在虚拟现实和机器人等应用中的价值。

Method: 采用动态时间选择性专家混合框架，通过路由机制协同使用高级文本语义和低级运动上下文，将时间运动特征分配给专门专家，使专家能动态确定选择容量并关注关键时间特征。

Conclusion: InterMoE框架通过动态专家选择和特征路由机制，成功解决了保持个体特征和语义保真度的挑战，为高质量人类交互生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality human interactions holds significant value for applications like virtual reality and robotics. However, existing methods often fail to preserve unique individual characteristics or fully adhere to textual descriptions. To address these challenges, we introduce InterMoE, a novel framework built on a Dynamic Temporal-Selective Mixture of Experts. The core of InterMoE is a routing mechanism that synergistically uses both high-level text semantics and low-level motion context to dispatch temporal motion features to specialized experts. This allows experts to dynamically determine the selection capacity and focus on critical temporal features, thereby preserving specific individual characteristic identities while ensuring high semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments show that InterMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in individual-specific high-fidelity 3D human interaction generation, reducing FID scores by 9% on the InterHuman dataset and 22% on InterX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型对受控语言扰动的响应可靠性，传统检索指标无法检测模型在语义理解上的缺陷。

Method: 使用40k MS COCO图像和人工标注，自动生成语义保持的改写和规则基础的语义翻转（改变对象类别、颜色或数量），通过不变性误差、语义敏感性差距和正率统计来总结模型行为。

Result: EVA02-CLIP和大型OpenCLIP变体在不变性-敏感性边界上表现最佳，而SigLIP和SigLIP2显示出较大的不变性误差，经常偏好翻转的标题而非人类描述。

Conclusion: LGIP提供了一个模型无关的诊断工具，能够检测视觉语言模型在语言鲁棒性方面的缺陷，这些缺陷在传统检索指标中是不可见的。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, OpenCLIP, EVA02-CLIP and SigLIP achieve strong zero-shot performance, but it is unclear how reliably they respond to controlled linguistic perturbations. We introduce Language-Guided Invariance Probing (LGIP), a benchmark that measures (i) invariance to meaning-preserving paraphrases and (ii) sensitivity to meaning-changing semantic flips in image-text matching. Using 40k MS COCO images with five human captions each, we automatically generate paraphrases and rule-based flips that alter object category, color or count, and summarize model behavior with an invariance error, a semantic sensitivity gap and a positive-rate statistic.
  Across nine VLMs, EVA02-CLIP and large OpenCLIP variants lie on a favorable invariance-sensitivity frontier, combining low paraphrase-induced variance with consistently higher scores for original captions than for their flipped counterparts. In contrast, SigLIP and SigLIP2 show much larger invariance error and often prefer flipped captions to the human descriptions, especially for object and color edits. These failures are largely invisible to standard retrieval metrics, indicating that LGIP provides a model-agnostic diagnostic for the linguistic robustness of VLMs beyond conventional accuracy scores.

Conclusion: 城中村改造具有碎片化、复杂性和非线性特征，需要分层和因地制宜的规划策略，研究结果为支持更包容、高效和可持续的城市更新提供了实证见解。

Abstract: Urban villages (UVs), informal settlements embedded within China's urban fabric, have undergone widespread demolition and redevelopment in recent decades. However, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of whether the demolished land has been effectively reused, raising concerns about the efficacy and sustainability of current redevelopment practices. To address the gap, this study proposes a deep learning-based framework to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of UVs in China. Specifically, semantic segmentation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is first used to map evolving UV boundaries, and then post-demolition land use is classified into six categories based on the "remained-demolished-redeveloped" phase: incomplete demolition, vacant land, construction sites, buildings, green spaces, and others. Four representative cities from China's four economic regions were selected as the study areas, i.e., Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central), Xi'an (West), and Harbin (Northeast). The results indicate: 1) UV redevelopment processes were frequently prolonged; 2) redevelopment transitions primarily occurred in peripheral areas, whereas urban cores remained relatively stable; and 3) three spatiotemporal transformation pathways, i.e., synchronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and gradual optimization, were revealed. This study highlights the fragmented, complex and nonlinear nature of UV redevelopment, underscoring the need for tiered and context-sensitive planning strategies. By linking spatial dynamics with the context of redevelopment policies, the findings offer valuable empirical insights that support more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable urban renewal, while also contributing to a broader global understanding of informal settlement transformations.

Abstract: In ill-posed imaging inverse problems, uncertainty quantification remains a fundamental challenge, especially in safety-critical applications. Recently, conformal prediction has been used to quantify the uncertainty that the inverse problem contributes to downstream tasks like image classification, image quality assessment, fat mass quantification, etc. While existing works handle only a scalar estimation target, practical applications often involve multiple targets. In response, we propose an asymptotically minimax approach to multi-target conformal prediction that provides tight prediction intervals while ensuring joint marginal coverage. We then outline how our minimax approach can be applied to multi-metric blind image quality assessment, multi-task uncertainty quantification, and multi-round measurement acquisition. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the benefits of our minimax method, relative to existing multi-target conformal prediction methods, using both synthetic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在安全关键领域的部署，模型可解释性变得至关重要。本文旨在揭示模型可解释性本身可能成为攻击面的安全漏洞。

Method: 提出色度扰动模块，通过系统性地改变前景和背景之间的颜色对比度来制作对抗样本，在联邦学习环境中累积这些扰动以毒化全局模型的特征归因。

Result: 攻击将Grad-CAM解释中的峰值激活重叠降低了35%，同时在所有评估数据集上保持96%以上的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 挑战了模型审计中"正确预测意味着忠实解释"的常见假设，证明可解释性本身可能成为攻击面，标准训练流程无法检测或缓解解释退化。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, visual explanation techniques have become essential tools for supporting transparency. In this work, we reveal a new class of attacks that compromise model interpretability without affecting accuracy. Specifically, we show that small color perturbations applied by adversarial clients in a federated learning setting can shift a model's saliency maps away from semantically meaningful regions while keeping the prediction unchanged. The proposed saliency-aware attack framework, called Chromatic Perturbation Module, systematically crafts adversarial examples by altering the color contrast between foreground and background in a way that disrupts explanation fidelity. These perturbations accumulate across training rounds, poisoning the global model's internal feature attributions in a stealthy and persistent manner. Our findings challenge a common assumption in model auditing that correct predictions imply faithful explanations and demonstrate that interpretability itself can be an attack surface. We evaluate this vulnerability across multiple datasets and show that standard training pipelines are insufficient to detect or mitigate explanation degradation, especially in the federated learning setting, where subtle color perturbations are harder to discern. Our attack reduces peak activation overlap in Grad-CAM explanations by up to 35% while preserving classification accuracy above 96% on all evaluated datasets.

TL;DR: BootOOD是一个完全自监督的OOD检测框架，通过从ID数据中合成伪OOD特征，利用神经坍缩现象，使用基于特征范数的轻量级辅助头进行OOD检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OOD检测器在处理与ID类别语义相似的OOD样本时表现不佳，需要一种能够有效处理语义挑战性OOD样本的方法。

Method: 通过ID表示的简单变换合成伪OOD特征，利用神经坍缩现象，引入基于特征范数的轻量级辅助头进行半径分类，将OOD检测与主分类器解耦。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet-200上的实验表明，BootOOD优于先验的后处理方法，在没有异常暴露的情况下超越基于训练的方法，并与最先进的异常暴露方法竞争，同时保持或提高ID准确率。

Conclusion: BootOOD提供了一个有效的自监督OOD检测解决方案，特别适用于处理语义相似的OOD样本，同时保持ID分类性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for deploying image classifiers in safety-sensitive environments, yet existing detectors often struggle when OOD samples are semantically similar to the in-distribution (ID) classes. We present BootOOD, a fully self-supervised OOD detection framework that bootstraps exclusively from ID data and is explicitly designed to handle semantically challenging OOD samples. BootOOD synthesizes pseudo-OOD features through simple transformations of ID representations and leverages Neural Collapse (NC), where ID features cluster tightly around class means with consistent feature norms. Unlike prior approaches that aim to constrain OOD features into subspaces orthogonal to the collapsed ID means, BootOOD introduces a lightweight auxiliary head that performs radius-based classification on feature norms. This design decouples OOD detection from the primary classifier and imposes a relaxed requirement: OOD samples are learned to have smaller feature norms than ID features, which is easier to satisfy when ID and OOD are semantically close. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-200 show that BootOOD outperforms prior post-hoc methods, surpasses training-based methods without outlier exposure, and is competitive with state-of-the-art outlier-exposure approaches while maintaining or improving ID accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效识别后门触发器并定位受害样本和标签，成功修复中毒的CLIP模型以消除后门效应。

Abstract: The advent of multimodal deep learning models, such as CLIP, has unlocked new frontiers in a wide range of applications, from image-text understanding to classification tasks. However, these models are not safe for adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, which can subtly manipulate model behavior. Moreover, existing defense methods typically involve training from scratch or fine-tuning using a large dataset without pinpointing the specific labels that are affected. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal contrastive learning models against such attacks. In particular, given a poisoned CLIP model, our approach can identify the backdoor trigger and pinpoint the victim samples and labels in an efficient manner. To that end, an image segmentation ``oracle'' is introduced as the supervisor for the output of the poisoned CLIP. We develop two algorithms to rectify the poisoned model: (1) differentiating between CLIP and Oracle's knowledge to identify potential triggers; (2) pinpointing affected labels and victim samples, and curating a compact fine-tuning dataset. With this knowledge, we are allowed to rectify the poisoned CLIP model to negate backdoor effects. Extensive experiments on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate our strategy is effective in CLIP-based backdoor defense.

Conclusion: 提出的半监督框架能有效利用未标注数据，提升单目高度估计模型的性能，解决了标注数据稀缺的限制。

Abstract: Monocular height estimation plays a critical role in 3D perception for remote sensing, offering a cost-effective alternative to multi-view or LiDAR-based methods. While deep learning has significantly advanced the capabilities of monocular height estimation, these methods remain fundamentally limited by the availability of labeled data, which are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain at scale. The scarcity of high-quality annotations hinders the generalization and performance of existing models. To overcome this limitation, we propose leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data through a semi-supervised learning framework, enabling the model to extract informative cues from unlabeled samples and improve its predictive performance. In this work, we introduce TSE-Net, a self-training pipeline for semi-supervised monocular height estimation. The pipeline integrates teacher, student, and exam networks. The student network is trained on unlabeled data using pseudo-labels generated by the teacher network, while the exam network functions as a temporal ensemble of the student network to stabilize performance. The teacher network is formulated as a joint regression and classification model: the regression branch predicts height values that serve as pseudo-labels, and the classification branch predicts height value classes along with class probabilities, which are used to filter pseudo-labels. Height value classes are defined using a hierarchical bi-cut strategy to address the inherent long-tailed distribution of heights, and the predicted class probabilities are calibrated with a Plackett-Luce model to reflect the expected accuracy of pseudo-labels. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on three datasets spanning different resolutions and imaging modalities. Codes are available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/tse-net.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading framework for novel view synthesis, yet its core optimization challenges remain underexplored. We identify two key issues in 3DGS optimization: entrapment in suboptimal local optima and insufficient convergence quality. To address these, we propose Opt3DGS, a robust framework that enhances 3DGS through a two-stage optimization process of adaptive exploration and curvature-guided exploitation. In the exploration phase, an Adaptive Weighted Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) method enhances global search to escape local optima. In the exploitation phase, a Local Quasi-Newton Direction-guided Adam optimizer leverages curvature information for precise and efficient convergence. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that Opt3DGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality by refining the 3DGS optimization process without modifying its underlying representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为分层提示学习（HPL）的统一框架，通过任务感知提示建模联合优化图像到图像（I2I）和文本到图像（T2I）的行人重识别任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的行人重识别方法通常将I2I和T2I任务分开处理，可能导致表示纠缠和性能不佳。这两种任务虽然共享检索目标，但面临不同挑战：I2I强调判别性身份学习，T2I需要准确的跨模态语义对齐。

Method: 1）任务路由Transformer：在共享视觉编码器中引入双分类令牌，分别路由I2I和T2I分支的特征；2）分层提示生成方案：集成身份级可学习令牌和实例级伪文本令牌；3）跨模态提示正则化：在提示令牌空间中强制执行语义对齐。

Conclusion: HPL框架通过统一的提示学习方法，有效解决了I2I和T2I行人重识别任务的联合优化问题，实现了优异的跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve target pedestrian images given either visual queries (image-to-image, I2I) or textual descriptions (text-to-image, T2I). Although both tasks share a common retrieval objective, they pose distinct challenges: I2I emphasizes discriminative identity learning, while T2I requires accurate cross-modal semantic alignment. Existing methods often treat these tasks separately, which may lead to representation entanglement and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a unified framework named Hierarchical Prompt Learning (HPL), which leverages task-aware prompt modeling to jointly optimize both tasks. Specifically, we first introduce a Task-Routed Transformer, which incorporates dual classification tokens into a shared visual encoder to route features for I2I and T2I branches respectively. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical prompt generation scheme that integrates identity-level learnable tokens with instance-level pseudo-text tokens. These pseudo-tokens are derived from image or text features via modality-specific inversion networks, injecting fine-grained, instance-specific semantics into the prompts. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal Prompt Regularization strategy to enforce semantic alignment in the prompt token space, ensuring that pseudo-prompts preserve source-modality characteristics while enhancing cross-modal transferability. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both I2I and T2I tasks.

Result: 在三个完全保留的队列上评估，NuClass最佳类别F1得分达96%，优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 多尺度、不确定性感知融合能够弥合幻灯片级病理基础模型与可靠细胞级表型预测之间的差距。

Abstract: Identifying cell types and subtypes from routine histopathology images is essential for improving the computational understanding of human disease. Existing tile-based models can capture detailed nuclear morphology but often fail to incorporate the broader tissue context that influences a cell's function and identity. In addition, available human annotations are typically coarse-grained and unevenly distributed across studies, making fine-grained subtype-level supervision difficult to obtain.
  To address these limitations, we introduce NuClass, a pathologist workflow inspired framework for cell-wise multi-scale integration of nuclear morphology and microenvironmental context. NuClass includes two main components: Path local, which focuses on nuclear morphology from 224-by-224 pixel crops, and Path global, which models the surrounding 1024-by-1024 pixel neighborhood. A learnable gating module adaptively balances local detail and contextual cues. To encourage complementary learning, we incorporate an uncertainty-guided objective that directs the global path to prioritize regions where the local path is uncertain. We also provide calibrated confidence estimates and Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance interpretability.
  To overcome the lack of high-quality annotations, we construct a marker-guided dataset from Xenium spatial transcriptomics assays, yielding single-cell resolution labels for more than two million cells across eight organs and 16 classes. Evaluated on three fully held-out cohorts, NuClass achieves up to 96 percent F1 for its best-performing class, outperforming strong baselines. Our results show that multi-scale, uncertainty-aware fusion can bridge the gap between slide-level pathological foundation models and reliable, cell-level phenotype prediction.

Conclusion: VVS通过部分验证跳过机制有效加速视觉自回归生成，揭示了重塑推测解码范式的强大潜力。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation models have demonstrated strong potential for image generation, yet their next-token-prediction paradigm introduces considerable inference latency. Although speculative decoding (SD) has been proven effective for accelerating visual AR models, its "draft one step, then verify one step" paradigm prevents a direct reduction of the forward passes, thus restricting acceleration potential. Motivated by the visual token interchangeability, we for the first time to explore verification skipping in the SD process of visual AR model generation to explicitly cut the number of target model forward passes, thereby reducing inference latency. Based on an analysis of the drafting stage's characteristics, we observe that verification redundancy and stale feature reusability are key factors to retain generation quality and speedup for verification-free steps. Inspired by these two observations, we propose a novel SD framework VVS to accelerate visual AR generation via partial verification skipping, which integrates three complementary modules: (1) a verification-free token selector with dynamical truncation, (2) token-level feature caching and reuse, and (3) fine-grained skipped step scheduling. Consequently, VVS reduces the number of target model forward passes by a factor of $2.8\times$ relative to vanilla AR decoding while maintaining competitive generation quality, offering a superior speed-quality trade-off over conventional SD frameworks and revealing strong potential to reshape the SD paradigm.

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) task aims at improving contrast while restoring details and textures for images captured in low-light conditions. HVI color space has made significant progress in this task by enabling precise decoupling of chrominance and luminance. However, for the interaction of chrominance and luminance branches, substantial distributional differences between the two branches prevalent in natural images limit complementary feature extraction, and luminance errors are propagated to chrominance channels through the nonlinear parameter. Furthermore, for interaction between different chrominance branches, images with large homogeneous-color regions usually exhibit weak correlation between chrominance branches due to concentrated distributions. Traditional pixel-wise losses exploit strong inter-branch correlations for co-optimization, causing gradient conflicts in weakly correlated regions. Therefore, we propose an Inter-Chrominance and Luminance Interaction (ICLR) framework including a Dual-stream Interaction Enhancement Module (DIEM) and a Covariance Correction Loss (CCL). The DIEM improves the extraction of complementary information from two dimensions, fusion and enhancement, respectively. The CCL utilizes luminance residual statistics to penalize chrominance errors and balances gradient conflicts by constraining chrominance branches covariance. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed ICLR framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成条件模板，优于其他模板构建方法，特别适用于群体差异大的医学图像分析。

Abstract: Deformable templates, or atlases, are images that represent a prototypical anatomy for a population, and are often enhanced with probabilistic anatomical label maps. They are commonly used in medical image analysis for population studies and computational anatomy tasks such as registration and segmentation. Because developing a template is a computationally expensive process, relatively few templates are available. As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods.

Abstract: Accurate nuclei detection and classification are fundamental to computational pathology, yet existing approaches are hindered by reliance on detailed expert annotations and insufficient use of tissue context. We present Tissue-Aware Nuclei Detection (TAND), a novel framework achieving joint nuclei detection and classification using point-level supervision enhanced by tissue mask conditioning. TAND couples a ConvNeXt-based encoder-decoder with a frozen Virchow-2 tissue segmentation branch, where semantic tissue probabilities selectively modulate the classification stream through a novel multi-scale Spatial Feature-wise Linear Modulation (Spatial-FiLM). On the PUMA benchmark, TAND achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing both tissue-agnostic baselines and mask-supervised methods. Notably, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in tissue-dependent cell types such as epithelium, endothelium, and stroma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to condition per-cell classification on learned tissue masks, offering a practical pathway to reduce annotation burden.

Abstract: One of the major causes of road accidents is driver fatigue that causes thousands of fatalities and injuries every year. This study shows development of a Driver Drowsiness Detection System meant to improve the safety of the road by alerting drivers who are showing signs of being drowsy. The system is based on a standard webcam that tracks the facial features of the driver with the main emphasis on the examination of eye movements that can be conducted with the help of the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) method. The Face Mesh by MediaPipe is a lightweight framework that can identify facial landmarks with high accuracy and efficiency, which is considered to be important in real time use. The system detects the moments of long eye shutdowns or a very low rate of blinking which are manifestations of drowsiness and alerts the driver through sound to get her attention back. This system achieves a high-performance and low-cost driver monitoring solution with the help of the computational power of OpenCV to process the image and the MediaPipe to identify faces. Test data experimental analyses indicate that the system is very accurate and responds quicker; this confirms that it can be a component of the current Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS).

*Dimitrios Koutsianos,Ladislav Mosner,Yannis Panagakis,Themos Stafylakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于α-散度的边界损失函数：Q-Margin（在参考度量中引入边界）和A3M（在对数中引入边界），解决了α-散度损失在面部和说话人验证中难以整合角度边界的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的α-散度损失函数虽然能诱导稀疏解，但在面部和说话人验证任务中难以有效整合角度边界，而边界对于验证性能至关重要。

Method: 通过两种不同方式整合角度边界：在参考度量中引入边界（Q-Margin）和在对数中引入边界（A3M），并针对A3M的训练不稳定性提出了原型重新初始化策略。

Result: 在IJB-B、IJB-C面部验证基准和VoxCeleb说话人验证任务上取得了显著性能提升，特别是在低误接受率下表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的两种边界α-散度损失函数在验证任务中表现优异，特别适用于需要最小化错误认证的高安全性应用场景。

Abstract: Performance in face and speaker verification is largely driven by margin based softmax losses like CosFace and ArcFace. Recently introduced $α$-divergence loss functions offer a compelling alternative, particularly for their ability to induce sparse solutions (when $α>1$). However, integrating an angular margin-crucial for verification tasks-is not straightforward. We find this integration can be achieved in at least two distinct ways: via the reference measure (prior probabilities) or via the logits (unnormalized log-likelihoods). In this paper, we explore both pathways, deriving two novel margin-based $α$-divergence losses: Q-Margin (margin in the reference measure) and A3M (margin in the logits). We identify and address a critical training instability in A3M-caused by the interplay of penalized logits and sparsity-with a simple yet effective prototype re-initialization strategy. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on the challenging IJB-B and IJB-C face verification benchmarks. We demonstrate similarly strong performance in speaker verification on VoxCeleb. Crucially, our models significantly outperform strong baselines at low false acceptance rates (FAR). This capability is crucial for practical high-security applications, such as banking authentication, when minimizing false authentications is paramount.

*Shrenik Patel,Daivik Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CacheFlow是一种无需训练的长视频问答解决方案，通过动态令牌丢弃和压缩长期记忆机制，显著减少处理令牌数量(最多87%)，同时保持回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理长视频问答时面临注意力机制和KV缓存随运行时间增长的问题，导致推理成本高昂或只能使用短视的滑动窗口方法。

Method: 结合动态令牌丢弃(DTD)和压缩长期记忆：DTD基于余弦相似度在线修剪每帧的补丁令牌，幸存令牌打包成固定大小的块；使用微小循环编码器构建检索索引，在生成时重新加载相关块的完整KV对。

Result: 在离线和流式视频问答基准测试中，CacheFlow优于当前强基线方法，同时处理令牌数量减少高达87%。

Conclusion: CacheFlow的双重方法使视觉语言模型既高效又具备上下文感知能力，为实用的长视频理解铺平了道路。

Abstract: Long-form video question answering (VQA) overwhelms current vision-language models (VLMs) because attention and key-value (KV) caches grow with runtime, forcing either expensive inference or near-sighted sliding windows. We introduce CacheFlow, a training-free pipeline that pairs Dynamic Token Dropping (DTD) with a compressive long-term memory. DTD prunes per-patch tokens online via cosine similarity to the previous frame, and surviving tokens are packed into fixed-size blocks. This online, per-frame processing makes our approach fundamentally suited for live streaming VQA. As blocks are processed, each one's keys are summarized by a tiny recurrent encoder to form a retrieval index, while the block's full KV pairs are offloaded and later rehydrated for generation, preserving answer fidelity. At inference, a consensus-based retrieval mechanism retrieves only the Top-K most relevant blocks and attends over both the retrieved and local context for precise, long-range reasoning. CacheFlow is drop-in, architecture-agnostic, and requires no fine-tuning. Experiments on both offline and streaming VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CacheFlow outperforms current strong baselines, while processing up to 87% less tokens. Our dual approach enables VLMs to be both efficient and context-aware, paving the way for practical long-form video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Part-X-MLLM是一个原生3D多模态大语言模型，通过结构化可执行语法将多样化3D任务统一为程序，能够从RGB点云和自然语言提示生成包含部件级边界框、语义描述和编辑命令的单一连贯标记序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D任务中缺乏统一接口的问题，通过将多样化3D任务统一为结构化程序，实现符号规划与几何合成的解耦，使任何兼容的几何引擎都能通过单一语言前端进行控制。

Method: 采用双编码器架构进行预训练，分离结构与语义，并在大规模部件中心数据集上进行指令微调，模型能够自回归生成结构化输出序列。

Result: 实验表明该模型在生成高质量结构化规划方面表现出色，在基于基础的问答、组合生成和局部化编辑等任务中通过统一接口实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Part-X-MLLM提供了一个统一的语言原生前端，能够有效驱动下游几何感知模块，实现部件级生成和编辑，为3D多模态任务提供了创新的结构化解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Part-X-MLLM, a native 3D multimodal large language model that unifies diverse 3D tasks by formulating them as programs in a structured, executable grammar. Given an RGB point cloud and a natural language prompt, our model autoregressively generates a single, coherent token sequence encoding part-level bounding boxes, semantic descriptions, and edit commands. This structured output serves as a versatile interface to drive downstream geometry-aware modules for part-based generation and editing. By decoupling the symbolic planning from the geometric synthesis, our approach allows any compatible geometry engine to be controlled through a single, language-native frontend. We pre-train a dual-encoder architecture to disentangle structure from semantics and instruction-tune the model on a large-scale, part-centric dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our model excels at producing high-quality, structured plans, enabling state-of-the-art performance in grounded Q\&A, compositional generation, and localized editing through one unified interface.

Motivation: 现有3D生成方法大多忽略了关键的物理和关节属性，限制了它们在具身AI中的应用价值。

Method: 提出了首个基于VLM的物理3D生成模型，采用新的3D表示方法将几何token化，token数量减少193倍；构建了PhysX-Mobility数据集，包含2000多个常见真实世界物体。

Conclusion: PhysX-Anything能够显著赋能下游应用，特别是在具身AI和基于物理的仿真领域。

Abstract: 3D modeling is shifting from static visual representations toward physical, articulated assets that can be directly used in simulation and interaction. However, most existing 3D generation methods overlook key physical and articulation properties, thereby limiting their utility in embodied AI. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysX-Anything, the first simulation-ready physical 3D generative framework that, given a single in-the-wild image, produces high-quality sim-ready 3D assets with explicit geometry, articulation, and physical attributes. Specifically, we propose the first VLM-based physical 3D generative model, along with a new 3D representation that efficiently tokenizes geometry. It reduces the number of tokens by 193x, enabling explicit geometry learning within standard VLM token budgets without introducing any special tokens during fine-tuning and significantly improving generative quality. In addition, to overcome the limited diversity of existing physical 3D datasets, we construct a new dataset, PhysX-Mobility, which expands the object categories in prior physical 3D datasets by over 2x and includes more than 2K common real-world objects with rich physical annotations. Extensive experiments on PhysX-Mobility and in-the-wild images demonstrate that PhysX-Anything delivers strong generative performance and robust generalization. Furthermore, simulation-based experiments in a MuJoCo-style environment validate that our sim-ready assets can be directly used for contact-rich robotic policy learning. We believe PhysX-Anything can substantially empower a broad range of downstream applications, especially in embodied AI and physics-based simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统蒸馏方法中少步模型的性能受限于多步教师模型，需要突破这一限制。

Method: 将强化学习融入蒸馏过程，使用DMD损失作为RL正则化，设计动态分布引导和动态重噪声采样训练策略。

Result: DMDR在少步方法中达到领先的视觉质量和提示连贯性，甚至超越多步教师模型性能。

Conclusion: RL与蒸馏结合能有效解锁少步生成器的潜力，实现性能突破。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills a pre-trained multi-step diffusion model to a few-step one to improve inference efficiency. However, the performance of the latter is often capped by the former. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose DMDR, a novel framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques into the distillation process. We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously. Meanwhile, we design the dynamic distribution guidance and dynamic renoise sampling training strategies to improve the initial distillation process. The experiments demonstrate that DMDR can achieve leading visual quality, prompt coherence among few-step methods, and even exhibit performance that exceeds the multi-step teacher.

TL;DR: GS-Light是一个基于高斯泼溅的文本引导3D场景重光照系统，使用训练免费的扩散模型处理多视图输入，通过LVLM解析光照先验，生成高质量的重光照3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D场景重光照方法在处理多视图一致性和用户意图理解方面存在挑战，需要开发能够准确解析文本指令并保持视图一致性的高效重光照方法。

Method: 使用LVLM解析文本提示为光照先验，结合几何和语义估计器生成光照图，通过多视图重光照模型生成重光照图像，最后微调3DGS场景。

Result: 在室内外场景评估中，GS-Light在视图一致性、图像质量、美学评分和语义相似度等指标上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GS-Light提供了一种高效、准确的文本引导3D场景重光照解决方案，能够更好地满足用户的光照需求并保持多视图一致性。

Abstract: We introduce GS-Light, an efficient, textual position-aware pipeline for text-guided relighting of 3D scenes represented via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines. Code and assets will be made available upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出了TiViBench基准测试来评估图像到视频生成模型的推理能力，并开发了VideoTPO测试时优化策略来提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型主要关注视觉保真度和时间一致性，缺乏对高阶推理能力的评估。需要专门工具来评估和提升视频生成模型的推理能力。

Method: 1) 设计TiViBench分层基准测试，从4个维度24个任务场景评估推理能力；2) 提出VideoTPO测试时优化策略，通过LLM自分析生成候选视频来识别优缺点。

Result: 商业模型(如Sora 2、Veo 3.1)显示出更强的推理潜力，开源模型因训练规模和数据多样性受限而潜力未充分挖掘。VideoTPO无需额外训练即可显著提升推理性能。

Conclusion: TiViBench和VideoTPO为评估和推进视频生成模型的推理能力奠定了基础，为该新兴领域的未来研究设定了框架。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of video generative models has shifted their focus from producing visually plausible outputs to tackling tasks requiring physical plausibility and logical consistency. However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在语义图像编辑方面取得了进展，但大多数方法在3D感知的物体操作方面表现不足，要么在图像空间操作，要么需要缓慢且容易出错的3D重建。

Result: 大量实验表明，FFSE在单轮和多轮3D感知编辑场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FFSE框架能够实现直观的3D感知物体编辑，保持物理一致性和场景一致性，为真实世界图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have significantly improved semantic image editing, yet most methods fall short in performing 3D-aware object manipulation. In this work, we present FFSE, a 3D-aware autoregressive framework designed to enable intuitive, physically-consistent object editing directly on real-world images. Unlike previous approaches that either operate in image space or require slow and error-prone 3D reconstruction, FFSE models editing as a sequence of learned 3D transformations, allowing users to perform arbitrary manipulations, such as translation, scaling, and rotation, while preserving realistic background effects (e.g., shadows, reflections) and maintaining global scene consistency across multiple editing rounds. To support learning of multi-round 3D-aware object manipulation, we introduce 3DObjectEditor, a hybrid dataset constructed from simulated editing sequences across diverse objects and scenes, enabling effective training under multi-round and dynamic conditions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed FFSE significantly outperforms existing methods in both single-round and multi-round 3D-aware editing scenarios.

Motivation: 解决SAM系列模型在控制分割粒度方面的局限性，用户通常需要手动细化结果才能达到所需的细节水平，这个过程既模糊又昂贵。

Method: 扩展UnSAM的分治策略，发现丰富的掩码-粒度对，引入新颖的粒度控制嵌入，实现精确连续的分割尺度控制。仅使用6K未标注图像和0.02%额外参数。

Result: 在超过11个基准测试中，UnSAMv2显著提升了SAM-2的性能：NoC90从5.69降至4.75，1-IoU从58.0提升至73.1，AR1000从49.6提升至68.3。

Conclusion: 少量未标注数据结合粒度感知的自监督学习方法可以释放视觉基础模型的潜力，实现任意粒度的分割能力。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.

Motivation: 现有VOS方法主要针对单镜头视频，难以处理镜头不连续性，限制了实际应用。多镜头视频对象分割面临标注数据稀疏的挑战。

Method: 提出了TMA数据增强策略，利用单镜头数据实现跨镜头泛化；开发了SAAS模型，能够有效检测和理解镜头转换；创建了Cut-VOS基准数据集。

Conclusion: SAAS模型能够有效处理多镜头视频对象分割问题，通过模拟镜头转换提升跨镜头分割能力，为MVOS领域提供了新的解决方案和基准。

Abstract: This work focuses on multi-shot semi-supervised video object segmentation (MVOS), which aims at segmenting the target object indicated by an initial mask throughout a video with multiple shots. The existing VOS methods mainly focus on single-shot videos and struggle with shot discontinuities, thereby limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a transition mimicking data augmentation strategy (TMA) which enables cross-shot generalization with single-shot data to alleviate the severe annotated multi-shot data sparsity, and the Segment Anything Across Shots (SAAS) model, which can detect and comprehend shot transitions effectively. To support evaluation and future study in MVOS, we introduce Cut-VOS, a new MVOS benchmark with dense mask annotations, diverse object categories, and high-frequency transitions. Extensive experiments on YouMVOS and Cut-VOS demonstrate that the proposed SAAS achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively mimicking, understanding, and segmenting across complex transitions.

Conclusion: SenseNova-SI展示了通过大规模多样化数据训练可以显著提升空间智能，并观察到新兴的泛化能力，该项目将持续更新并公开发布模型以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.

TL;DR: 提出JiT方法，使用简单的像素级大块Transformer直接预测干净图像，而非噪声，基于流形假设在生成建模中取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前去噪扩散模型预测噪声而非干净图像，但根据流形假设，自然数据位于低维流形而噪声数据不在，因此直接预测干净图像能让网络在超高维空间中有效工作。

Method: 使用简单的大块Transformer直接在像素级别操作，无需分词器、预训练或额外损失，仅通过图像Transformer直接预测干净数据。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256和512×512分辨率上，使用16和32的大块尺寸获得了竞争性结果，而预测高维噪声的方法会灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 通过将网络映射回流形基础，JiT为基于Transformer的原始自然数据扩散提供了一个自包含的范式，回归到生成建模的基本原理。

Abstract: Today's denoising diffusion models do not "denoise" in the classical sense, i.e., they do not directly predict clean images. Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than "$\textbf{Just image Transformers}$", or $\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data.

### [297] [TimeStampEval: A Simple LLM Eval and a Little Fuzzy Matching Trick to Improve Search Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11594)
*James McCammon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TimeStampEval基准和两阶段方法，用于从长文本记录中检索非逐字引用的精确时间戳，显著提高检索准确率并降低90%以上推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统模糊匹配在语义相同但语法不同的引用检索中的失败问题，特别是在对齐官方书面记录与语音转文字转录本时。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：RapidFuzz预过滤后，LLM在短片段上验证。通过优化提示设计（查询前置、紧凑格式）和适度推理预算来提高性能。

Result: 将弱设置的准确率从37%提升至77%，强设置达到90%以上；模糊匹配准确率提升达50个百分点，延迟减半，每正确结果成本降低达96%。

Conclusion: 该方法对转录本长度、词汇漂移和领域变化具有鲁棒性，在10个转录本（50k-900k tokens）测试中保持95-100%的拒绝准确率。

Abstract: Traditional fuzzy matching often fails when searching for quotes that are semantically identical but syntactically different across documents-a common issue when aligning official written records with speech-to-text transcripts. We introduce TimeStampEval, a benchmark for retrieving precise millisecond timestamps from long transcripts given non-verbatim quotes. Our simple two-stage method dramatically improves retrieval accuracy while cutting inference costs by over 90%. The motivating use case is an automated long-form podcast that assembles Congressional Record clips into AI-hosted narration. The technical challenge: given a sentence-timestamped transcript and a target quote that may differ due to transcription or editorial drift, return exact start and end boundaries. Standard algorithms handle verbatim text but break under fuzzier variants. Evaluating six modern LLMs on a 2,800-sentence (120k-token) transcript revealed four key findings. (1) Prompt design matters more than model choice: placing the query before the transcript and using compact formatting improved accuracy by 3-20 points while reducing token count by 30-40%. (2) Off-by-one errors form a distinct category, showing models understand the task but misplace boundaries. (3) A modest reasoning budget (600-850 tokens) raises accuracy from 37% to 77% for weak setups and to above 90% for strong ones. (4) Our "Assisted Fuzzy" approach-RapidFuzz pre-filtering followed by LLM verification on short snippets-improves fuzzy match accuracy by up to 50 points while halving latency and reducing cost per correct result by up to 96%. Extended tests on ten transcripts (50k-900k tokens, 1989-2025) confirm robustness to transcript length, vocabulary drift, and domain change, maintaining 95-100% rejection accuracy for absent targets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiroThinker v1.0是一个开源研究代理，通过交互式扩展作为模型规模和上下文长度之外的第三个性能提升维度，能够执行多达600次工具调用，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理主要关注模型规模或上下文长度的扩展，但缺乏在模型层面系统处理更深层次和更频繁的代理-环境交互的能力。MiroThinker探索交互扩展作为第三个性能改进维度。

Method: 通过强化学习实现交互扩展，模型在256K上下文窗口下能够执行多达600次工具调用，利用环境反馈和外部信息获取来纠正错误和优化推理轨迹。

Result: 在GAIA、HLE、BrowseComp和BrowseComp-ZH四个基准测试中，72B变体分别达到81.9%、37.7%、47.1%和55.6%的准确率，超越先前开源代理并接近商业对应物如GPT-5-high。

Conclusion: 交互扩展展现出与模型规模和上下文长度类似的扩展行为，被确立为构建下一代开源研究代理的第三个关键维度，补充了模型能力和上下文窗口。

Abstract: We present MiroThinker v1.0, an open-source research agent designed to advance tool-augmented reasoning and information-seeking capabilities. Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.

### [299] [On the Notion that Language Models Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11810)
*Bertram Højer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文质疑语言模型是否真正具备推理能力，认为其只是实现统计模式匹配而非真正的逻辑推理机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估NLP领域中语言模型被描述为具有推理能力的说法是否准确，澄清语言模型的实际计算过程与推理概念之间的不一致性

Method: 将基于transformer的语言模型视为实现隐式有限阶马尔可夫核，将上下文映射到条件标记分布的统计系统

Result: 语言模型产生的类似推理输出对应于学习核中的统计规律性和近似统计不变性，而非显式逻辑机制的实施

Conclusion: 语言模型是统计模式匹配器而非真正的推理者，这一区分对于评估语言模型中的认知不确定性至关重要

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are said to be exhibiting reasoning, but what does this entail? We assess definitions of reasoning and how key papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) use the notion and argue that the definitions provided are not consistent with how LMs are trained, process information, and generate new tokens. To illustrate this incommensurability we assume the view that transformer-based LMs implement an \textit{implicit} finite-order Markov kernel mapping contexts to conditional token distributions. In this view, reasoning-like outputs correspond to statistical regularities and approximate statistical invariances in the learned kernel rather than the implementation of explicit logical mechanisms. This view is illustrative of the claim that LMs are "statistical pattern matchers"" and not genuine reasoners and provides a perspective that clarifies why reasoning-like outputs arise in LMs without any guarantees of logical consistency. This distinction is fundamental to how epistemic uncertainty is evaluated in LMs. We invite a discussion on the importance of how the computational processes of the systems we build and analyze in NLP research are described.

### [300] [Scaling Open-Weight Large Language Models for Hydropower Regulatory Information Extraction: A Systematic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11821)
*Hong-Jun Yoon,Faisal Ashraf,Thomas A. Ruggles,Debjani Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估了7个开源大语言模型(0.6B-70B参数)在水利许可文档信息提取中的性能-计算资源权衡，发现14B参数是有效性的关键阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监管文档信息提取中性能与计算资源之间的关键权衡问题，为实际部署提供实证指导。

Method: 使用7个不同参数规模(0.6B-70B)的开源模型在水利许可文档上进行信息提取评估，分析验证方法的有效性。

Result: 发现14B参数阈值：低于此阈值模型无效(F1<0.15)，高于此阈值可达64% F1；小模型最高51% F1，大模型可达77% F1但需企业级基础设施；识别出小模型中完美召回率反而表示提取失败的系统性幻觉模式。

Conclusion: 建立了首个监管背景下开源信息提取模型的资源-性能映射，为模型选择提供证据基础，结果对水利合规具有直接价值，且参数缩放效应的见解可推广到其他信息提取任务。

Abstract: Information extraction from regulatory documents using large language models presents critical trade-offs between performance and computational resources. We evaluated seven open-weight models (0.6B-70B parameters) on hydropower licensing documentation to provide empirical deployment guidance.
  Our analysis identified a pronounced 14B parameter threshold where validation methods transition from ineffective (F1 $<$ 0.15) to viable (F1 = 0.64). Consumer-deployable models achieve 64\% F1 through appropriate validation, while smaller models plateau at 51\%. Large-scale models approach 77\% F1 but require enterprise infrastructure.
  We identified systematic hallucination patterns where perfect recall indicates extraction failure rather than success in smaller models. Our findings establish the first comprehensive resource-performance mapping for open-weight information extraction in regulatory contexts, enabling evidence-based model selection.
  These results provide immediate value for hydropower compliance while contributing insights into parameter scaling effects that generalize across information extraction tasks.

### [301] [Towards Autoformalization of LLM-generated Outputs for Requirement Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11829)
*Mihir Gupte,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探索使用基于LLM的自动形式化工具来验证LLM生成的输出与自然语言需求的一致性，通过两个实验展示了该方法在一致性检查和形式验证方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前虽然LLM在从自然语言生成结构化输出方面表现出潜力，但缺乏验证这些输出准确性的正式方法。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用简单的基于LLM的自动形式化器，对LLM生成的输出与自然语言需求进行验证。进行了两个实验：一致性检查和逻辑不一致性识别。

Result: 第一个实验成功识别了两个不同表述的自然语言需求在逻辑上是等价的；第二个实验成功识别了自然语言需求与LLM生成输出之间的逻辑不一致性。

Conclusion: 自动形式化在确保LLM生成输出的保真度和逻辑一致性方面具有显著潜力，为未来更广泛的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of translating informal statements into formal logic, has gained renewed interest with the emergence of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs show promise in generating structured outputs from natural language (NL), such as Gherkin Scenarios from NL feature requirements, there's currently no formal method to verify if these outputs are accurate. This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool. Our findings, while limited, suggest that autoformalization holds significant potential for ensuring the fidelity and logical consistency of LLM-generated outputs, laying a crucial foundation for future, more extensive studies into this novel application.

### [302] [Three Stage Narrative Analysis; Plot-Sentiment Breakdown, Structure Learning and Concept Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11857)
*Taimur Khan,Ramoza Ahsan,Mohib Hameed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析电影剧本情感弧线的框架，通过自定义词典进行情感分析，并使用层次聚类技术对相似情感情节进行聚类，帮助用户选择叙事内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 故事理解和分析是自然语言理解中的挑战领域，需要深度计算语义表示和句法处理。大量叙事数据需要自动化语义分析和计算学习，而非手动分析方法。

Method: 使用基于NRC-VAD数据集构建的自定义词典进行情感分析，应用LabMTsimple storylab模块，并采用Wards层次聚类技术对相似情感情节进行聚类。

Result: 在电影数据集上的实验评估表明，该分析结果对消费者和读者在选择叙事或故事时很有帮助。

Conclusion: 该框架能够提取叙事中传达的高层和低层概念，通过情感弧线分析和聚类技术为故事选择提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: Story understanding and analysis have long been challenging areas within Natural Language Understanding. Automated narrative analysis requires deep computational semantic representations along with syntactic processing. Moreover, the large volume of narrative data demands automated semantic analysis and computational learning rather than manual analytical approaches. In this paper, we propose a framework that analyzes the sentiment arcs of movie scripts and performs extended analysis related to the context of the characters involved. The framework enables the extraction of high-level and low-level concepts conveyed through the narrative. Using dictionary-based sentiment analysis, our approach applies a custom lexicon built with the LabMTsimple storylab module. The custom lexicon is based on the Valence, Arousal, and Dominance scores from the NRC-VAD dataset. Furthermore, the framework advances the analysis by clustering similar sentiment plots using Wards hierarchical clustering technique. Experimental evaluation on a movie dataset shows that the resulting analysis is helpful to consumers and readers when selecting a narrative or story.

### [303] [Identifying Imaging Follow-Up in Radiology Reports: A Comparative Analysis of Traditional ML and LLM Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11867)
*Namu Park,Giridhar Kaushik Ramachandran,Kevin Lybarger,Fei Xia,Ozlem Uzuner,Meliha Yetisgen,Martin Gunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究构建了包含6,393份放射学报告的标注语料库，用于评估大语言模型在随访依从性检测任务中的表现，发现GPT-4o在优化提示下达到最佳性能，接近人类标注者水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏专门用于评估大语言模型在放射学任务表现的专业领域数据集，需要构建标注语料库来系统比较传统机器学习方法与生成式大语言模型的性能。

Method: 构建了6,393份放射学报告的标注语料库，系统比较了逻辑回归、支持向量机、Longformer、微调Llama3-8B-Instruct与生成式大语言模型（GPT-4o和GPT-OSS-20B），后者在基础设置和任务优化设置下进行测试。

Result: GPT-4o（优化设置）表现最佳（F1=0.832），GPT-OSS-20B（优化设置）次之（F1=0.828），逻辑回归和支持向量机也有较强表现（F1=0.776和0.775），人类标注者间一致性高（F1=0.846）。

Conclusion: 大语言模型通过提示优化可以接近人类水平，但可解释且资源效率高的传统模型仍然是重要的基准方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown considerable promise in clinical natural language processing, yet few domain-specific datasets exist to rigorously evaluate their performance on radiology tasks. In this work, we introduce an annotated corpus of 6,393 radiology reports from 586 patients, each labeled for follow-up imaging status, to support the development and benchmarking of follow-up adherence detection systems. Using this corpus, we systematically compared traditional machine-learning classifiers, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Longformer, and a fully fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct, with recent generative LLMs. To evaluate generative LLMs, we tested GPT-4o and the open-source GPT-OSS-20B under two configurations: a baseline (Base) and a task-optimized (Advanced) setting that focused inputs on metadata, recommendation sentences, and their surrounding context. A refined prompt for GPT-OSS-20B further improved reasoning accuracy. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals estimated via non-parametric bootstrapping. Inter-annotator agreement was high (F1 = 0.846). GPT-4o (Advanced) achieved the best performance (F1 = 0.832), followed closely by GPT-OSS-20B (Advanced; F1 = 0.828). LR and SVM also performed strongly (F1 = 0.776 and 0.775), underscoring that while LLMs approach human-level agreement through prompt optimization, interpretable and resource-efficient models remain valuable baselines.

*Fernanda Bufon Färber,Iago Alves Brito,Julia Soares Dollis,Pedro Schindler Freire Brasil Ribeiro,Rafael Teixeira Sousa,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedPT是首个针对巴西葡萄牙语的大规模真实世界医疗语料库，包含38.4万条医患问答对，通过多阶段筛选和LLM标注增强，支持医疗专科分类等任务，旨在解决低资源语言医疗AI的公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型主要关注高资源语言，而简单翻译无法捕捉特定临床和文化差异（如地方性疾病），这为其他语言社区创建了医疗AI应用的障碍。

Method: 构建包含384,095条真实医患问答的语料库，采用混合定量-定性分析方法进行多阶段筛选和上下文增强，使用LLM驱动标注将问题分类为7种语义类型。

Result: 语料库涵盖3,200个主题，具有独特的语言特性（如医患沟通的自然不对称性）。在医疗专科路由任务中，微调1.7B参数模型在20类分类上达到94% F1分数，错误分类反映了真实的临床模糊性。

Conclusion: MedPT数据集公开释放，旨在促进葡萄牙语世界更公平、准确和文化敏感的医疗技术发展，证明其具有深度语义丰富性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show transformative potential in healthcare, their development remains focused on high-resource languages, creating a critical barrier for others as simple translation fails to capture unique clinical and cultural nuances, such as endemic diseases. To address this, we introduce MedPT, the first large-scale, real-world corpus for Brazilian Portuguese, comprising 384,095 authentic question-answer pairs from patient-doctor interactions. The dataset underwent a meticulous multi-stage curation protocol, using a hybrid quantitative-qualitative analysis to filter noise and contextually enrich thousands of ambiguous queries. We further augmented the corpus via LLM-driven annotation, classifying questions into seven semantic types to capture user intent. Our analysis reveals its thematic breadth (3,200 topics) and unique linguistic properties, like the natural asymmetry in patient-doctor communication. To validate its utility, we benchmark a medical specialty routing task: fine-tuning a 1.7B parameter model achieves an outstanding 94\% F1-score on a 20-class setup. Furthermore, our qualitative error analysis shows misclassifications are not random but reflect genuine clinical ambiguities (e.g., between comorbid conditions), proving the dataset's deep semantic richness. We publicly release MedPT to foster the development of more equitable, accurate, and culturally-aware medical technologies for the Portuguese-speaking world.

### [305] [ClinStructor: AI-Powered Structuring of Unstructured Clinical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11883)
*Karthikeyan K,Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,David Carlson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClinStructor是一个利用大语言模型将临床自由文本转换为结构化问答对的管道，旨在解决临床笔记中的偏见、泛化性和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含有价值的信息，但其非结构化格式带来了挑战，包括无意偏见（如性别或种族偏见）、跨临床设置的泛化性差（如不同EHR系统间模型性能差异）以及可解释性差。

Method: 使用大语言模型将临床自由文本转换为结构化的、任务特定的问答对，然后进行预测建模。

Result: 在ICU死亡率预测任务中，与直接微调相比，该方法仅导致预测性能适度下降（AUC下降2-3%），同时显著提高了透明度和可控性。

Conclusion: ClinStructor为在临床环境中构建可靠、可解释和可泛化的机器学习模型奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain valuable, context-rich information, but their unstructured format introduces several challenges, including unintended biases (e.g., gender or racial bias), and poor generalization across clinical settings (e.g., models trained on one EHR system may perform poorly on another due to format differences) and poor interpretability. To address these issues, we present ClinStructor, a pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to convert clinical free-text into structured, task-specific question-answer pairs prior to predictive modeling. Our method substantially enhances transparency and controllability and only leads to a modest reduction in predictive performance (a 2-3% drop in AUC), compared to direct fine-tuning, on the ICU mortality prediction task. ClinStructor lays a strong foundation for building reliable, interpretable, and generalizable machine learning models in clinical environments.

*Eric Hua Qing Zhang,Julia Ive*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过监督微调和强化学习技术增强GPT-2的心理治疗对话生成能力，显著提升了情感识别准确率和对话质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19加剧了心理健康服务的可及性挑战，预训练语言模型缺乏情境和情感意识，需要开发更合适的治疗对话系统

Method: 重构输入格式以同时处理上下文信息和情感状态，采用多组件奖励函数使模型输出与专业治疗师响应和标注情感对齐

Result: 强化学习在多个评估指标上优于基线GPT-2：BLEU(0.0111)、ROUGE-1(0.1397)、ROUGE-2(0.0213)、ROUGE-L(0.1317)、METEOR(0.0581)，情感准确率达到99.34%（基线为66.96%）

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效开发治疗对话系统，作为治疗师的有价值辅助工具，同时保持必要的人类临床监督

Abstract: Mental health illness represents a substantial global socioeconomic burden, with COVID-19 further exacerbating accessibility challenges and driving increased demand for telehealth mental health support. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions through 24/7 availability and non-judgmental interactions, pre-trained models often lack the contextual and emotional awareness necessary for appropriate therapeutic responses. This paper investigated the application of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance GPT-2's capacity for therapeutic dialogue generation. The methodology restructured input formats to enable simultaneous processing of contextual information and emotional states alongside user input, employing a multi-component reward function that aligned model outputs with professional therapist responses and annotated emotions. Results demonstrated improvements through reinforcement learning over baseline GPT-2 across multiple evaluation metrics: BLEU (0.0111), ROUGE-1 (0.1397), ROUGE-2 (0.0213), ROUGE-L (0.1317), and METEOR (0.0581). LLM evaluation confirmed high contextual relevance and professionalism, while reinforcement learning achieved 99.34% emotion accuracy compared to 66.96% for baseline GPT-2. These findings demonstrate reinforcement learning's effectiveness in developing therapeutic dialogue systems that can serve as valuable assistive tools for therapists while maintaining essential human clinical oversight.

TL;DR: CALM是一个可解释的临床文本分类框架，通过将预测分解为各个语义组件的贡献和，提供透明且可信的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床文本分类中预测不透明的问题，帮助研究人员和医生理解患者记录中哪些部分驱动风险信号。

Method: 使用加性大语言模型框架，将半结构化文本输入分解为语义组件，预测结果作为各组件贡献的加和，实现前向计算中的可解释性。

Result: CALM在保持与传统LLM分类器相当性能的同时，提高了可信度，支持质量保证检查，并在模型开发和审计中揭示临床有意义的模式。

Conclusion: CALM框架为临床文本分类提供了可解释的解决方案，通过加性结构和可视化支持，增强了模型在研究和临床环境中的实用性和可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models have advanced clinical text classification, but their opaque predictions remain a critical barrier to practical adoption in research and clinical settings where investigators and physicians need to understand which parts of a patient's record drive risk signals. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{CALM}, short for \textbf{Classification with Additive Large Language Models}, an interpretable framework for semi-structured text where inputs are composed of semantically meaningful components, such as sections of an admission note or question-answer fields from an intake form. CALM predicts outcomes as the additive sum of each component's contribution, making these contributions part of the forward computation itself and enabling faithful explanations at both the patient and population level. The additive structure also enables clear visualizations, such as component-level risk curves similar to those used in generalized additive models, making the learned relationships easier to inspect and communicate. Although CALM expects semi-structured inputs, many clinical documents already have this form, and similar structure can often be automatically extracted from free-text notes. CALM achieves performance comparable to conventional LLM classifiers while improving trust, supporting quality-assurance checks, and revealing clinically meaningful patterns during model development and auditing.

*Karthikeyan K,Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Bhuwan Dhingra,David Edwin Carlson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了InData数据集来评估LLM在数据安全场景下的多步工具推理能力，发现当前模型在复杂任务上表现不佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM直接生成和执行代码访问敏感数据的安全风险，通过预定义安全工具进行间接数据交互

Method: 构建InData数据集，包含三个难度级别的数据分析问题，评估15个开源LLM的多步工具推理能力

Result: 大型模型在简单任务上准确率达97.3%，但在困难任务上降至69.6%，显示当前LLM缺乏稳健的多步工具推理能力

Conclusion: InData为开发具有更强多步工具使用能力的LLM提供了评估基准，将公开发布数据集和代码

Abstract: Large language model agents for data analysis typically generate and execute code directly on databases. However, when applied to sensitive data, this approach poses significant security risks. To address this issue, we propose a security-motivated alternative: restrict LLMs from direct code generation and data access, and require them to interact with data exclusively through a predefined set of secure, verified tools. Although recent tool-use benchmarks exist, they primarily target tool selection and simple execution rather than the compositional, multi-step reasoning needed for complex data analysis. To reduce this gap, we introduce Indirect Data Engagement (InData), a dataset designed to assess LLMs' multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. InData includes data analysis questions at three difficulty levels--Easy, Medium, and Hard--capturing increasing reasoning complexity. We benchmark 15 open-source LLMs on InData and find that while large models (e.g., gpt-oss-120b) achieve high accuracy on Easy tasks (97.3%), performance drops sharply on Hard tasks (69.6%). These results show that current LLMs still lack robust multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. With InData, we take a step toward enabling the development and evaluation of LLMs with stronger multi-step tool-use capabilities. We will publicly release the dataset and code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-KAT评估方法和实体匿名化技术，以提升大型语言模型在知识图谱对话生成中对外部知识的利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在各种NLP任务中表现出色，但在知识图谱对话生成任务中利用外部知识的能力尚未充分探索，经常依赖内部知识而脱离提供的知识图谱。

Method: 1. 引入LLM-KAT评估程序来测量生成响应中的知识依附度；2. 提出简单有效的实体匿名化技术，鼓励LLMs更好地利用外部知识。

Result: 在OpenDialKG数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了LLMs对外部知识的依附度。

Conclusion: 实体匿名化技术能有效提升LLMs在知识图谱对话生成中对外部知识的利用能力。

Abstract: Knowledge graph-based dialogue generation (KG-DG) is a challenging task requiring models to effectively incorporate external knowledge into conversational responses. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various NLP tasks, their ability to utilize external knowledge in KG-DG remains under-explored. We observe that LLMs often rely on internal knowledge, leading to detachment from provided knowledge graphs, even when they are given a flawlessly retrieved knowledge graph. First, we introduce LLM-KAT, an evaluation procedure for measuring knowledge attachment in generated responses. Second, we propose a simple yet effective entity anonymization technique to encourage LLMs to better leverage external knowledge. Experiments on the OpenDialKG dataset demonstrate that our approach improves LLMs' attachment on external knowledge.

*Steven Cao,Gregory Valiant,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究语言模型的熵校准问题，发现模型在生成过程中存在校准错误，且这种错误随规模扩大改善缓慢，需要通过截断分布来平衡文本质量与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在生成过程中熵校准的问题，探索模型规模扩大是否能改善校准错误，以及理论上是否能在不牺牲对数损失的情况下实现校准。

Method: 首先在简化理论设置中分析校准错误随数据集规模的缩放行为，然后在0.5B到70B参数的语言模型中进行实证测量，验证理论预测。

Result: 发现校准错误的缩放指数接近0，意味着大模型与小模型以相似速率累积错误，这解释了为什么即使大模型质量更高，仍需使用相似程度的截断采样。

Conclusion: 理论上证明，如果能够访问预测文本未来熵的黑盒模型，就可以在不增加对数损失的情况下减少熵，实现无代价的校准。

Abstract: We study the problem of entropy calibration, which asks whether a language model's entropy over generations matches its log loss on human text. Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing (and text quality decreasing) as generations grow longer. This error accumulation is a fundamental problem in autoregressive models, and the standard solution is to truncate the distribution, which improves text quality at the cost of diversity. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text.

*Hui Huang,Yanping Chen,Ruizhang Huang,Chuan Lin,Yongbin Qin*

TL;DR: 提出了ReasoningNER框架，通过显式推理机制改进生成式LLM在命名实体识别中的性能，特别是在零样本和低资源场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式LLM在NER任务中通常通过指令调优提升性能，但缺乏显式可验证的推理机制，导致次优性能和脆弱的泛化能力，特别是在需要从有限上下文线索进行推理的场景中。

Method: 提出三阶段推理框架：1) 生成带有NER导向思维链的数据集；2) 使用思维链调优NER模型，使其在得出最终答案前生成连贯的推理过程；3) 通过推理增强阶段使用综合奖励信号优化推理过程。

Result: 在零样本设置下达到SOTA性能，F1分数比GPT-4高出12.3个百分点，展示了在NER任务中令人印象深刻的认知能力。

Conclusion: ReasoningNER框架通过将提取范式从隐式模式匹配转向显式推理，证明了其在推理导向信息提取研究中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Generative LLMs typically improve Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance through instruction tuning. They excel at generating entities by semantic pattern matching but lack an explicit, verifiable reasoning mechanism. This "cognitive shortcutting" leads to suboptimal performance and brittle generalization, especially in zero-shot and lowresource scenarios where reasoning from limited contextual cues is crucial. To address this issue, a reasoning framework is proposed for NER, which shifts the extraction paradigm from implicit pattern matching to explicit reasoning. This framework consists of three stages: Chain of Thought (CoT) generation, CoT tuning, and reasoning enhancement. First, a dataset annotated with NER-oriented CoTs is generated, which contain task-relevant reasoning chains. Then, they are used to tune the NER model to generate coherent rationales before deriving the final answer. Finally, a reasoning enhancement stage is implemented to optimize the reasoning process using a comprehensive reward signal. This stage ensures explicit and verifiable extractions. Experiments show that ReasoningNER demonstrates impressive cognitive ability in the NER task, achieving competitive performance. In zero-shot settings, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming GPT-4 by 12.3 percentage points on the F1 score. Analytical results also demonstrate its great potential to advance research in reasoningoriented information extraction. Our codes are available at https://github.com/HuiResearch/ReasoningIE.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了思维链解释在道德场景中的双重作用：既能提高透明度，也可能因用户仅关注可接受结果而强化确认偏见，导致对错误推理的盲目信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示思维链解释在促进透明度的同时，如何可能因用户倾向于信任看似可接受的输出而掩盖推理错误，特别是在多模态道德场景中。

Method: 通过系统性地扰动推理链和操纵表达语气，分析视觉语言模型中的推理错误及其对用户信任和错误检测能力的影响。

Result: 发现两个关键效应：(1)用户常将信任等同于结果一致性，即使推理有缺陷也持续依赖；(2)自信语气抑制错误检测但维持依赖，表明表达风格可凌驾于正确性之上。

Conclusion: 思维链解释既能澄清也能误导，强调NLP系统需提供鼓励审查和批判性思维而非盲目信任的解释。

Abstract: Explanations are often promoted as tools for transparency, but they can also foster confirmation bias; users may assume reasoning is correct whenever outputs appear acceptable. We study this double-edged role of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations in multimodal moral scenarios by systematically perturbing reasoning chains and manipulating delivery tones. Specifically, we analyze reasoning errors in vision language models (VLMs) and how they impact user trust and the ability to detect errors. Our findings reveal two key effects: (1) users often equate trust with outcome agreement, sustaining reliance even when reasoning is flawed, and (2) the confident tone suppresses error detection while maintaining reliance, showing that delivery styles can override correctness. These results highlight how CoT explanations can simultaneously clarify and mislead, underscoring the need for NLP systems to provide explanations that encourage scrutiny and critical thinking rather than blind trust. All code will be released publicly.

*Truong Vo,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估大语言模型文化能力的新方法，通过真实情境上下文而非抽象规范来测试文化推理能力，并引入四个补充指标来更全面地评估响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型文化能力评估方法局限于去情境化的正确性或强制选择判断，忽视了文化理解和推理的需求，无法准确反映模型在多元文化环境中的实际表现。

Method: 引入基于真实情境上下文的评估基准，要求模型进行文化基础推理，除了标准精确匹配指标外，还新增了覆盖率、特异性、内涵和连贯性四个补充指标。

Result: 实证分析显示，传统的"薄"评估会系统性高估文化能力且评估结果不稳定、方差大；而新的"厚"评估方法能揭示推理深度差异、降低方差，提供更稳定可解释的文化理解信号。

Conclusion: 基于情境上下文的"厚"评估方法比传统方法更能准确评估大语言模型的文化能力，为模型在多元文化环境中的部署提供了更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in culturally diverse environments, yet existing evaluations of cultural competence remain limited. Existing methods focus on de-contextualized correctness or forced-choice judgments, overlooking the need for cultural understanding and reasoning required for appropriate responses. To address this gap, we introduce a set of benchmarks that, instead of directly probing abstract norms or isolated statements, present models with realistic situational contexts that require culturally grounded reasoning. In addition to the standard Exact Match metric, we introduce four complementary metrics (Coverage, Specificity, Connotation, and Coherence) to capture different dimensions of model's response quality. Empirical analysis across frontier models reveals that thin evaluation systematically overestimates cultural competence and produces unstable assessments with high variance. In contrast, thick evaluation exposes differences in reasoning depth, reduces variance, and provides more stable, interpretable signals of cultural understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在有限训练数据下，如何通过回译和微调的组合策略提升低资源语言对的翻译质量。

Method: 首先使用回译从单语日语语料生成合成数据，然后在真实的小型平行数据集上进行微调，最后将两种方法结合使用。

Result: 单独回译：COMET=0.468；单独微调：COMET=0.589；组合方法：COMET=0.597，显著优于单独技术。

Conclusion: 回译和针对性微调的协同使用可以显著提升翻译质量，为低资源语言对提供轻量级但强大的改进策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of combining fine-tuning and backtranslation on a small Japanese corpus for neural machine translation. Starting from a baseline English{\textrightarrow}Japanese model (COMET = 0.460), we first apply backtranslation (BT) using synthetic data generated from monolingual Japanese corpora, yielding a modest increase (COMET = 0.468). Next, we fine-tune (FT) the model on a genuine small parallel dataset drawn from diverse Japanese news and literary corpora, achieving a substantial jump to COMET = 0.589 when using Mistral 7B. Finally, we integrate both backtranslation and fine-tuning{ -- }first augmenting the small dataset with BT generated examples, then adapting via FT{ -- }which further boosts performance to COMET = 0.597. These results demonstrate that, even with limited training data, the synergistic use of backtranslation and targeted fine-tuning on Japanese corpora can significantly enhance translation quality, outperforming each technique in isolation. This approach offers a lightweight yet powerful strategy for improving low-resource language pairs.

TL;DR: LLMLagBench是一个用于评估LLM训练数据时间边界的基准测试，通过检测模型对近期事件的了解来识别其知识截止时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在特定时间点前的文本数据上预训练，形成了严格的知识边界。当这个限制未知或被忽视时，模型可能在推理任务中无意间混合过时的时效性信息与通用知识，影响回答准确性。

Method: 引入LLMLagBench作为系统性方法，通过评估LLM对近期事件的知识来识别其训练数据的最早可能时间边界。评估了大量LLM，包括明确声明和未声明训练截止时间的模型。

Result: 通过人工验证和与公开的LLM预训练信息比较，评估了该基准测试的可靠性。

Conclusion: LLMLagBench为识别LLM知识时间边界提供了有效的系统性方法，有助于理解模型的知识局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on textual data up to a specific temporal cutoff. This creates a strict knowledge boundary beyond which models cannot provide accurate information without querying external sources. More subtly, when this limitation is unknown or ignored, LLMs may inadvertently blend outdated time-sensitive information with general knowledge during reasoning tasks, potentially compromising response accuracy. We introduce LLMLagBench, an LLM freshness benchmark, as a systematic approach for identifying the earliest probable temporal boundaries of an LLM's training data by evaluating its knowledge of recent events. We then apply this benchmark to evaluate a large set of LLMs, including models with both explicitly declared and undeclared training cutoffs. The reliability of the benchmark is assessed by manual validation and comparison with publicly released information about LLM pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究存在伪多模态性（源帖子有视觉内容但评论被视为纯文本）和用户同质性问题，无法反映真实的多模态交互和用户个性差异。

Method: 提出PRISM模型：1）从历史帖子推导用户画像；2）通过思维链对齐文本和视觉线索；3）使用相互任务强化机制联合优化立场检测和立场感知响应生成。

Result: 在U-MStance数据集上的实验表明，PRISM相比强基线模型取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 用户中心和上下文基础的多模态推理对于现实立场理解具有有效性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal social media content has driven research in Multimodal Conversational Stance Detection (MCSD), which aims to interpret users' attitudes toward specific targets within complex discussions. However, existing studies remain limited by: **1) pseudo-multimodality**, where visual cues appear only in source posts while comments are treated as text-only, misaligning with real-world multimodal interactions; and **2) user homogeneity**, where diverse users are treated uniformly, neglecting personal traits that shape stance expression. To address these issues, we introduce **U-MStance**, the first user-centric MCSD dataset, containing over 40k annotated comments across six real-world targets. We further propose **PRISM**, a **P**ersona-**R**easoned mult**I**modal **S**tance **M**odel for MCSD. PRISM first derives longitudinal user personas from historical posts and comments to capture individual traits, then aligns textual and visual cues within conversational context via Chain-of-Thought to bridge semantic and pragmatic gaps across modalities. Finally, a mutual task reinforcement mechanism is employed to jointly optimize stance detection and stance-aware response generation for bidirectional knowledge transfer. Experiments on U-MStance demonstrate that PRISM yields significant gains over strong baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of user-centric and context-grounded multimodal reasoning for realistic stance understanding.

Method: 构建TeleSalesCorpus数据集，提出AI-Salesman框架：训练阶段使用贝叶斯监督强化学习从噪声对话中学习稳健销售策略；推理阶段采用动态大纲引导代理（DOGA），利用预建脚本库提供动态逐轮战略指导

Result: 实验结果表明AI-Salesman在自动指标和综合人工评估中显著优于基线模型，在复杂说服场景中表现出色

Conclusion: AI-Salesman框架通过双阶段架构和动态大纲引导，有效解决了目标驱动说服对话中的战略规划和事实忠实性问题

Abstract: Goal-driven persuasive dialogue, exemplified by applications like telemarketing, requires sophisticated multi-turn planning and strict factual faithfulness, which remains a significant challenge for even state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). A lack of task-specific data often limits previous works, and direct LLM application suffers from strategic brittleness and factual hallucination. In this paper, we first construct and release TeleSalesCorpus, the first real-world-grounded dialogue dataset for this domain. We then propose AI-Salesman, a novel framework featuring a dual-stage architecture. For the training stage, we design a Bayesian-supervised reinforcement learning algorithm that learns robust sales strategies from noisy dialogues. For the inference stage, we introduce the Dynamic Outline-Guided Agent (DOGA), which leverages a pre-built script library to provide dynamic, turn-by-turn strategic guidance. Moreover, we design a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines fine-grained metrics for key sales skills with the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed AI-Salesman significantly outperforms baseline models in both automatic metrics and comprehensive human evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in complex persuasive scenarios.

TL;DR: VBackChecker是一个基于"眼见为实"原则的无参考幻觉检测框架，通过像素级Grounding LLM验证MLLM生成响应与视觉输入的一致性，在R^2-HalBench基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的幻觉问题，需要准确检测以确保在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 使用像素级Grounding LLM，具备推理和参考分割能力，通过创新的R-Instruct指令调优数据生成流程，包含丰富上下文描述、接地掩码和硬负样本。

Result: 在R^2-HalBench基准上超越先前复杂框架，达到最先进性能，甚至可与GPT-4o的幻觉检测能力相媲美，在像素级接地任务中比先前方法提升超过10%。

Conclusion: VBackChecker提供了一个有效的无参考幻觉检测解决方案，不仅处理丰富上下文场景，还提供可解释性，为MLLM的可靠性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have unlocked powerful cross-modal capabilities, but still significantly suffer from hallucinations. As such, accurate detection of hallucinations in MLLMs is imperative for ensuring their reliability in practical applications. To this end, guided by the principle of "Seeing is Believing", we introduce VBackChecker, a novel reference-free hallucination detection framework that verifies the consistency of MLLMgenerated responses with visual inputs, by leveraging a pixellevel Grounding LLM equipped with reasoning and referring segmentation capabilities. This reference-free framework not only effectively handles rich-context scenarios, but also offers interpretability. To facilitate this, an innovative pipeline is accordingly designed for generating instruction-tuning data (R-Instruct), featuring rich-context descriptions, grounding masks, and hard negative samples. We further establish R^2 -HalBench, a new hallucination benchmark for MLLMs, which, unlike previous benchmarks, encompasses real-world, rich-context descriptions from 18 MLLMs with high-quality annotations, spanning diverse object-, attribute, and relationship-level details. VBackChecker outperforms prior complex frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on R^2 -HalBench, even rivaling GPT-4o's capabilities in hallucination detection. It also surpasses prior methods in the pixel-level grounding task, achieving over a 10% improvement. All codes, data, and models are available at https://github.com/PinxueGuo/VBackChecker.

Motivation: 现有搜索代理管道依赖强化学习优化，但存在稀疏结果奖励问题，导致探索效率低下和训练不稳定。

Method: 使用冻结的非对称批评LLM，基于完整轨迹和黄金答案的权限信息回顾性评估每个回合，将评估转化为稳定的密集奖励来指导策略改进。

Result: 在多样化多跳推理基准测试中，CriticSearch始终优于现有基线，实现更快的收敛、更好的训练稳定性和更高性能。

Conclusion: CriticSearch通过密集的回合级反馈机制有效解决了搜索代理训练中的稀疏奖励问题，显著提升了模型的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) with search engines enables large language models to iteratively retrieve up-to-date external knowledge, enhancing adaptability and generalization in complex question-answering tasks. However, existing search agent pipelines typically depend on reinforcement learning based optimization, which often suffers from sparse outcome rewards, leading to inefficient exploration and unstable training. We introduce CriticSearch, a fine-grained credit-assignment framework that supplies dense, turn-level feedback via a retrospective critic mechanism. During training, a frozen, asymmetric critique LLM retrospectively evaluates each turn using privileged information from the full trajectory and gold answers, converting these assessments into stable, dense rewards that guide policy improvement. Experimental results across diverse multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CriticSearch consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving faster convergence, improved training stability, and higher performance.

Abstract: Fine-grained entity recognition is crucial for reasoning and decision-making in task-oriented dialogues, yet current large language models (LLMs) continue to face challenges in domain adaptation and retrieval controllability. We introduce MME-RAG, a Multi-Manager-Expert Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that decomposes entity recognition into two coordinated stages: type-level judgment by lightweight managers and span-level extraction by specialized experts. Each expert is supported by a KeyInfo retriever that injects semantically aligned, few-shot exemplars during inference, enabling precise and domain-adaptive extraction without additional training. Experiments on CrossNER, MIT-Movie, MIT-Restaurant, and our newly constructed multi-domain customer-service dataset demonstrate that MME-RAG performs better than recent baselines in most domains. Ablation studies further show that both the hierarchical decomposition and KeyInfo-guided retrieval are key drivers of robustness and cross-domain generalization, establishing MME-RAG as a scalable and interpretable solution for adaptive dialogue understanding.

Motivation: LLM在生成文本时经常产生事实错误的幻觉，这在医疗、金融等领域存在严重风险。现有方法在模型访问受限时需要多次API调用，增加了延迟和成本

Method: 基于直觉：生成文本中对事实探针的响应应该在单个LLM内部和不同LLM之间保持一致。通过检查这种一致性来检测幻觉，不依赖外部知识库

Result: 在多个数据集上的实证评估显示，CONFACTCHECK能以更少资源高效检测幻觉事实，在相似条件下比现有基线方法获得更高的准确率

Conclusion: CONFACTCHECK提供了一种资源高效的幻觉检测方法，特别适用于模型访问受限或资源受限的场景

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable text generation capabilities, often hallucinate and generate text that is factually incorrect and not grounded in real-world knowledge. This poses serious risks in domains like healthcare, finance, and customer support. A typical way to use LLMs is via the APIs provided by LLM vendors where there is no access to model weights or options to fine-tune the model. Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in contextualized word embeddings have greatly improved semantic tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and contextual similarity, but most progress has been limited to high-resource languages like English. Vietnamese, in contrast, still lacks robust models and evaluation resources for fine-grained semantic understanding. In this paper, we present ViConBERT, a novel framework for learning Vietnamese contextualized embeddings that integrates contrastive learning (SimCLR) and gloss-based distillation to better capture word meaning. We also introduce ViConWSD, the first large-scale synthetic dataset for evaluating semantic understanding in Vietnamese, covering both WSD and contextual similarity. Experimental results show that ViConBERT outperforms strong baselines on WSD (F1 = 0.87) and achieves competitive performance on ViCon (AP = 0.88) and ViSim-400 (Spearman's rho = 0.60), demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling both discrete senses and graded semantic relations.

Abstract: Motivated by the high costs of using black-box Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a novel prompt compression paradigm, under which we use smaller LLMs to compress inputs for the larger ones. We present the first comprehensive LLM-as-a-compressor benchmark spanning 25 open- and closed-source models, which reveals significant disparity in models' compression ability in terms of (i) preserving semantically important information (ii) following the user-provided compression rate (CR). We further improve the performance of gpt-4.1-mini, the best overall vanilla compressor, with Textgrad-based compression meta-prompt optimization. We also identify the most promising open-source vanilla LLM - Qwen3-4B - and post-train it with a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), pursuing the dual objective of CR adherence and maximizing the downstream task performance. We call the resulting model Cmprsr and demonstrate its superiority over both extractive and vanilla abstractive compression across the entire range of compression rates on lengthy inputs from MeetingBank and LongBench as well as short prompts from GSM8k. The latter highlights Cmprsr's generalizability across varying input lengths and domains. Moreover, Cmprsr closely follows the requested compression rate, offering fine control over the cost-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: 承诺公开发布增强的数据集，相信这一资源将推动法律文档自动摘要领域的发展。

Abstract: Summarization of legal judgments poses a heavy cognitive burden on law practitioners due to the complexity of the language, context-sensitive legal jargon, and the length of the document. Therefore, the automatic summarization of legal documents has attracted serious attention from natural language processing researchers. Since the abstractive summaries of legal documents generated by deep neural methods remain prone to the risk of misrepresenting nuanced legal jargon or overlooking key contextual details, we envisage a rising trend toward the use of extractive case summarizers.
  Given the high cost of human annotation for gold standard extractive summaries, we engineer a light and transparent pipeline that leverages existing abstractive gold standard summaries to create the corresponding extractive gold standard versions. The approach ensures that the experts` opinions ensconced in the original gold standard abstractive summaries are carried over to the transformed extractive summaries. We aim to augment seven existing case summarization datasets, which include abstractive summaries, by incorporating corresponding extractive summaries and create an enriched data resource for case summarization research community. To ensure the quality of the augmented extractive summaries, we perform an extensive comparative evaluation with the original abstractive gold standard summaries covering structural, lexical, and semantic dimensions. We also compare the domain-level information of the two summaries. We commit to release the augmented datasets in the public domain for use by the research community and believe that the resource will offer opportunities to advance the field of automatic summarization of legal documents.

TL;DR: 研究比较了LLMs和人类在抢答式测验中的表现差异，发现LLMs在维基百科未覆盖的问题和需要数值答案的问题上表现较差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在许多NLP任务上超越了人类表现，但尚不清楚对人类困难的问题是否对LLMs也同样困难

Method: 收集日本测验数据（包含问题、答案和人类正确率），在不同设置下让LLMs回答测验，从两个分析视角比较与人类正确率的差异

Result: 实验结果显示，相比人类，LLMs在维基百科未覆盖答案的问题和需要数值答案的问题上表现更差

Conclusion: LLMs与人类在问题难度上存在差异，特别是在知识覆盖范围和数值推理方面

Abstract: LLMs have achieved performance that surpasses humans in many NLP tasks. However, it remains unclear whether problems that are difficult for humans are also difficult for LLMs. This study investigates how the difficulty of quizzes in a buzzer setting differs between LLMs and humans. Specifically, we first collect Japanese quiz data including questions, answers, and correct response rate of humans, then prompted LLMs to answer the quizzes under several settings, and compare their correct answer rate to that of humans from two analytical perspectives. The experimental results showed that, compared to humans, LLMs struggle more with quizzes whose correct answers are not covered by Wikipedia entries, and also have difficulty with questions that require numerical answers.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在接收到否定指令时会出现"讽刺性反弹"现象，即被禁止的概念反而更容易被激活。反弹强度受干扰文本类型影响，语义干扰会增强反弹，而重复干扰有助于抑制。极性分离程度与反弹持续性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索人类认知中的"讽刺性反弹"现象是否也存在于大型语言模型中，即否定指令是否反而会激活被禁止的概念。

Method: 通过两个实验：(1) 在否定指令后使用不同类型的干扰文本并测量反弹强度；(2) 测试模型对中性和负面框架的区分能力及其与反弹持续性的关系。还进行了电路追踪分析。

Result: 结果显示否定后立即出现反弹，较长或语义干扰会增强反弹，而重复干扰支持抑制。更强的极性分离与更持久的反弹相关。电路分析发现中间层注意力头放大被禁令牌，而早期层进行抑制。

Conclusion: 研究将认知预测与机制洞察联系起来，揭示了长上下文干扰的机制，并发布了ReboundBench数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Negation instructions such as 'do not mention $X$' can paradoxically increase the accessibility of $X$ in human thought, a phenomenon known as ironic rebound. Large language models (LLMs) face the same challenge: suppressing a concept requires internally activating it, which may prime rebound instead of avoidance. We investigated this tension with two experiments. \textbf{(1) Load \& content}: after a negation instruction, we vary distractor text (semantic, syntactic, repetition) and measure rebound strength. \textbf{(2) Polarity separation}: We test whether models distinguish neutral from negative framings of the same concept and whether this separation predicts rebound persistence. Results show that rebound consistently arises immediately after negation and intensifies with longer or semantic distractors, while repetition supports suppression. Stronger polarity separation correlates with more persistent rebound. Together, these findings, complemented by a circuit tracing analysis that identifies sparse middle-layer attention heads amplifying forbidden tokens while early layers suppress, link cognitive predictions of ironic rebound with mechanistic insights into long-context interference. To support future work, we release ReboundBench, a dataset of $5,000$ systematically varied negation prompts designed to probe rebound in LLMs.

TL;DR: ILAKKANAM是首个泰米尔语特定语言评估基准，包含820个来自斯里兰卡学校考试的问题，评估显示LLMs在低年级表现良好但随着语言复杂性增加而下降，性能可能源于暴露而非真正理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言基准依赖英语翻译数据集，无法捕捉泰米尔语等低资源、形态丰富语言的语言和文化细微差别，需要专门评估基准。

Method: 使用820个斯里兰卡学校泰米尔语考试问题构建基准，由训练有素的语言学家按五个语言类别和一个事实知识类别进行标注，涵盖1-13年级以确保广泛语言覆盖。

Result: Gemini 2.5表现最佳，开源模型落后；所有模型在低年级问题表现良好但随着语言复杂性增加明显下降；模型整体性能与识别语言类别能力无强相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs在泰米尔语中的表现可能更多源于训练数据暴露而非真正的语言理解，需要改进低资源语言的语言基础能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong generalization across tasks in high-resource languages; however, their linguistic competence in low-resource and morphologically rich languages such as Tamil remains largely unexplored. Existing multilingual benchmarks often rely on translated English datasets, failing to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of the target language. To address this gap, we introduce ILAKKANAM, the first Tamil-specific linguistic evaluation benchmark manually curated using 820 questions from Sri Lankan school-level Tamil subject examination papers. Each question is annotated by trained linguists under five linguistic categories and a factual knowledge category, spanning Grades 1--13 to ensure broad linguistic coverage. We evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs using a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that Gemini 2.5 achieves the highest overall performance, while open-source models lag behind, highlighting the gap in linguistic grounding. Category- and grade-wise analyses reveal that all models perform well on lower-grade questions but show a clear decline as linguistic complexity increases. Further, no strong correlation is observed between a model's overall performance and its ability to identify linguistic categories, suggesting that performance may be driven by exposure rather than genuine understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MRMBench基准和推理时探测方法，用于评估奖励模型在多维偏好上的表现，并发现该方法与LLM对齐性能强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估方法通常在固定成对排序测试集上进行，但无法提供各偏好维度的性能信息，需要更细粒度的评估方法。

Method: 构建了MRMBench基准（包含6个不同偏好维度的探测任务），并提出了推理时探测方法分析奖励预测时使用的维度。

Result: MRMBench与LLM对齐性能强相关；奖励模型在多维偏好捕获上存在困难；推理时探测方法能可靠评估奖励预测置信度。

Conclusion: MRMBench是开发先进奖励模型的可靠参考，多目标优化在奖励建模中具有潜力，推理时探测方法能提升LLM对齐效果。

Abstract: Previous methods evaluate reward models by testing them on a fixed pairwise ranking test set, but they typically do not provide performance information on each preference dimension. In this work, we address the evaluation challenge of reward models by probing preference representations. To confirm the effectiveness of this evaluation method, we construct a Multi-dimensional Reward Model Benchmark (MRMBench), a collection of six probing tasks for different preference dimensions. We design it to favor and encourage reward models that better capture preferences across different dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce an analysis method, inference-time probing, which identifies the dimensions used during the reward prediction and enhances its interpretability. Through extensive experiments, we find that MRMBench strongly correlates with the alignment performance of large language models (LLMs), making it a reliable reference for developing advanced reward models. Our analysis of MRMBench evaluation results reveals that reward models often struggle to capture preferences across multiple dimensions, highlighting the potential of multi-objective optimization in reward modeling. Additionally, our findings show that the proposed inference-time probing method offers a reliable metric for assessing the confidence of reward predictions, which ultimately improves the alignment of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有KGQA系统通常只返回高度相关但可预测的答案，缺乏发现惊喜和新颖答案的能力，这在实际应用中是一个重要但被忽视的需求。

Method: 提出基于相关性、新颖性和惊喜度的严格惊喜度量标准，构建专家标注的基准数据集，并设计包含知识检索、子图推理和惊喜探索三个子任务的结构化评估流程。

Result: 实验表明，最先进的LLM在检索任务上表现良好，但在识别真正令人惊喜和有价值的发现方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: LLM在发现惊喜洞察力方面仍有显著改进空间，SerenQA框架为未来研究提供了基准和评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly advanced knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), yet existing systems are typically optimized for returning highly relevant but predictable answers. A missing yet desired capacity is to exploit LLMs to suggest surprise and novel ("serendipitious") answers. In this paper, we formally define the serendipity-aware KGQA task and propose the SerenQA framework to evaluate LLMs' ability to uncover unexpected insights in scientific KGQA tasks. SerenQA includes a rigorous serendipity metric based on relevance, novelty, and surprise, along with an expert-annotated benchmark derived from the Clinical Knowledge Graph, focused on drug repurposing. Additionally, it features a structured evaluation pipeline encompassing three subtasks: knowledge retrieval, subgraph reasoning, and serendipity exploration. Our experiments reveal that while state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on retrieval, they still struggle to identify genuinely surprising and valuable discoveries, underscoring a significant room for future improvements.

Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型在人类-AI对话场景中的安全问题，包括有害内容检测和对抗性提示防护，需要开发一个轻量级但高效的安全保护系统。

Method: 使用约140万个训练实例对基础模型进行指令调优，构建两个专门组件：ContentFilter基于MLCommons危害分类学识别安全风险，JailbreakFilter通过精心设计的课程学习覆盖60种主要攻击类型。

Result: 在公共和专有安全基准测试中，SGuard-v1实现了最先进的安全性能，同时保持轻量级，减少了部署开销，并提供多类安全预测和二元置信度分数以提高可解释性。

Conclusion: SGuard-v1作为一个轻量级安全护栏系统，在保持高效安全防护的同时降低了部署成本，并通过Apache-2.0许可证发布以促进AI安全研究和实际部署。

Abstract: We present SGuard-v1, a lightweight safety guardrail for Large Language Models (LLMs), which comprises two specialized models to detect harmful content and screen adversarial prompts in human-AI conversational settings. The first component, ContentFilter, is trained to identify safety risks in LLM prompts and responses in accordance with the MLCommons hazard taxonomy, a comprehensive framework for trust and safety assessment of AI. The second component, JailbreakFilter, is trained with a carefully designed curriculum over integrated datasets and findings from prior work on adversarial prompting, covering 60 major attack types while mitigating false-unsafe classification. SGuard-v1 is built on the 2B-parameter Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct model that supports 12 languages. We curate approximately 1.4 million training instances from both collected and synthesized data and perform instruction tuning on the base model, distributing the curated data across the two component according to their designated functions. Through extensive evaluation on public and proprietary safety benchmarks, SGuard-v1 achieves state-of-the-art safety performance while remaining lightweight, thereby reducing deployment overhead. SGuard-v1 also improves interpretability for downstream use by providing multi-class safety predictions and their binary confidence scores. We release the SGuard-v1 under the Apache-2.0 License to enable further research and practical deployment in AI safety.

TL;DR: QA-Noun是一个基于问答的框架，专门用于捕捉名词为中心的语义关系，通过9个问题模板覆盖名词的显式句法和隐式上下文角色，与QA-SRL结合实现句子意义的统一分解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于QA的语义方法主要关注谓词-论元关系，但对名词为中心的语义关系处理不足，需要开发专门框架来补充这一空白。

Method: 定义了9个问题模板来捕捉名词的句法和上下文角色，创建了包含2000多个标注名词的数据集，并训练了与QA-SRL集成的模型。

Result: QA-Noun几乎完全覆盖了AMR的名词论元，同时揭示了额外的上下文隐含关系，与QA-SRL结合比FactScore和DecompScore等方法的粒度高出130%以上。

Conclusion: QA-Noun完善了基于QA的语义框架，为跨文本对齐提供了一个全面且可扩展的细粒度语义分解方法。

Abstract: Decomposing sentences into fine-grained meaning units is increasingly used to model semantic alignment. While QA-based semantic approaches have shown effectiveness for representing predicate-argument relations, they have so far left noun-centered semantics largely unaddressed. We introduce QA-Noun, a QA-based framework for capturing noun-centered semantic relations. QA-Noun defines nine question templates that cover both explicit syntactical and implicit contextual roles for nouns, producing interpretable QA pairs that complement verbal QA-SRL. We release detailed guidelines, a dataset of over 2,000 annotated noun mentions, and a trained model integrated with QA-SRL to yield a unified decomposition of sentence meaning into individual, highly fine-grained, facts. Evaluation shows that QA-Noun achieves near-complete coverage of AMR's noun arguments while surfacing additional contextually implied relations, and that combining QA-Noun with QA-SRL yields over 130\% higher granularity than recent fact-based decomposition methods such as FactScore and DecompScore. QA-Noun thus complements the broader QA-based semantic framework, forming a comprehensive and scalable approach to fine-grained semantic decomposition for cross-text alignment.

TL;DR: TAdaRAG是一个新颖的检索增强生成框架，通过任务自适应知识图谱构建解决传统RAG中信息丢失和无关细节的问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法存在两个主要问题：1）由于输入上下文窗口限制，检索到的外部知识被截断成小块，导致信息丢失，引发响应幻觉和推理链断裂；2）检索非结构化知识会引入无关细节，干扰准确推理。

Method: 提出TAdaRAG框架，包含：1）意图驱动路由机制到领域特定提取模板；2）监督微调；3）基于强化学习的隐式提取机制，确保知识整合的简洁性、连贯性和非冗余性。

Result: 在6个公共基准测试和1个真实业务基准测试(NowNewsQA)上，使用3种骨干模型进行评估，TAdaRAG在多个领域和长文本任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAdaRAG通过任务自适应知识图谱构建，有效解决了传统RAG的信息丢失和无关细节问题，展现了强大的泛化能力和实际应用效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves large language models by retrieving external knowledge, often truncated into smaller chunks due to the input context window, which leads to information loss, resulting in response hallucinations and broken reasoning chains. Moreover, traditional RAG retrieves unstructured knowledge, introducing irrelevant details that hinder accurate reasoning. To address these issues, we propose TAdaRAG, a novel RAG framework for on-the-fly task-adaptive knowledge graph construction from external sources. Specifically, we design an intent-driven routing mechanism to a domain-specific extraction template, followed by supervised fine-tuning and a reinforcement learning-based implicit extraction mechanism, ensuring concise, coherent, and non-redundant knowledge integration. Evaluations on six public benchmarks and a real-world business benchmark (NowNewsQA) across three backbone models demonstrate that TAdaRAG outperforms existing methods across diverse domains and long-text tasks, highlighting its strong generalization and practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种因果框架来分析和减轻RLHF奖励模型中的长度偏差，通过反事实数据增强方法训练奖励模型，使其能够独立于冗长度评估内容质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF训练的奖励模型存在长度偏差，倾向于将冗长度与质量混淆，偏爱更长的回答。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强方法生成响应对：长度不同但内容相似的配对，以及内容不同但长度相似的配对，用于训练奖励模型。

Result: 实证评估表明，该方法减少了奖励分配中的长度偏差，使策略模型产生更简洁、内容聚焦的输出。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效减少了长度偏差，提高了RLHF流程中奖励建模的鲁棒性和内容敏感性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is widely used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, RLHF-trained reward models often exhibit length bias -- a systematic tendency to favor longer responses by conflating verbosity with quality. We propose a causal framework for analyzing and mitigating length bias in RLHF reward modeling. Central to our approach is a counterfactual data augmentation method that generates response pairs designed to isolate content quality from verbosity. These counterfactual examples are then used to train the reward model, enabling it to assess responses based on content quality independently of verbosity. Specifically, we construct (1) length-divergent pairs with similar content and (2) content-divergent pairs of similar length. Empirical evaluations show that our method reduces length bias in reward assignment and leads to more concise, content-focused outputs from the policy model. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces length bias and improves the robustness and content sensitivity of reward modeling in RLHF pipelines.

Conclusion: MMWOZ数据集和MATE模型为构建实用的多模态任务导向对话代理提供了基础，有助于弥合理论研究和实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems have garnered significant attention due to their conversational ability to accomplish goals, such as booking airline tickets for users. Traditionally, task-oriented dialogue systems are conceptualized as intelligent agents that interact with users using natural language and have access to customized back-end APIs. However, in real-world scenarios, the widespread presence of front-end Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and the absence of customized back-end APIs create a significant gap for traditional task-oriented dialogue systems in practical applications. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we collect MMWOZ, a new multimodal dialogue dataset that is extended from MultiWOZ 2.3 dataset. Specifically, we begin by developing a web-style GUI to serve as the front-end. Next, we devise an automated script to convert the dialogue states and system actions from the original dataset into operation instructions for the GUI. Lastly, we collect snapshots of the web pages along with their corresponding operation instructions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal model called MATE (Multimodal Agent for Task-oriEnted dialogue) as the baseline model for the MMWOZ dataset. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experimental analysis using MATE to investigate the construction of a practical multimodal agent for task-oriented dialogue.

Result: GAPO训练的模型产生更有效和更多样化的响应，在标准基准测试中提高多样性而不损害准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from mode collapse, repeatedly generating the same few completions even when many valid answers exist, limiting their diversity across a wide range of tasks. We introduce Group-Aware Policy Optimization (GAPO), a simple extension of the recent and popular Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that computes rewards over the group as a whole. GAPO enables learning from the group-level properties such as diversity and coverage. We demonstrate GAPO using a frequency-aware reward function that encourages uniform sampling over valid LLM completions, and show that GAPO-trained models produce valid and more diverse model responses. Beyond this setup, GAPO generalizes to open-ended prompts and improves response diversity without compromising accuracy on standard LLM benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MMLU-Pro). Our code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推进Lychee的Uni-MoE系列在语言中心多模态理解、推理和生成方面的能力，构建一个能够理解全模态并生成图像、文本和语音的全开源模型。

Method: 采用动态容量MoE框架平衡计算效率和能力，使用共享、路由和空专家处理10种跨模态输入；Omni-Modality 3D RoPE确保自注意力层的时空跨模态对齐；渐进式监督微调策略激活模态特定专家，并通过平衡数据组合和迭代GSPO-DPO方法稳定强化学习训练。

Result: 在85个基准测试中达到SOTA或高度竞争力表现，在76个基准测试中超过50个优于Qwen2.5-Omni（使用1.2T tokens训练）；视频理解平均提升7%，全模态理解平均提升7%，视听推理提升4%；长语音处理词错误率降低4.2%，在低级图像处理和可控生成方面领先5个指标。

Conclusion: Uni-MoE 2.0通过创新的MoE架构、训练策略和数据技术，在显著减少训练数据量的情况下（75B tokens vs 1.2T tokens）实现了卓越的多模态性能，证明了其在全模态理解和生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present Uni-MoE 2.0 from the Lychee family. As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the Qwen2.5-7B dense architecture, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.

Abstract: Notice to Air Missions (NOTAMs) serve as a critical channel for disseminating key flight safety information, yet their complex linguistic structures and implicit reasoning pose significant challenges for automated parsing. Existing research mainly focuses on surface-level tasks such as classification and named entity recognition, lacking deep semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose NOTAM semantic parsing, a task emphasizing semantic inference and the integration of aviation domain knowledge to produce structured, inference-rich outputs. To support this task, we construct Knots (Knowledge and NOTAM Semantics), a high-quality dataset of 12,347 expert-annotated NOTAMs covering 194 Flight Information Regions, enhanced through a multi-agent collaborative framework for comprehensive field discovery. We systematically evaluate a wide range of prompt-engineering strategies and model-adaptation techniques, achieving substantial improvements in aviation text understanding and processing. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and offer valuable insights for automated NOTAM analysis systems.

Result: 在MQUAKE-CF-3k数据集上达到95.48%的准确率，相比之前方法提升5.28%，证明过程对齐对复杂任务的重要性。

Conclusion: 对于复杂任务，对齐推理过程对于构建可信赖的LLM至关重要，仅关注结果的RL方法会损害推理完整性。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to be faithful to new knowledge in complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks is a critical, yet unsolved, challenge. We find that SFT-based methods, e.g., Reason-KE, while state-of-the-art, suffer from a "faithfulness gap": they optimize for format mimicry rather than sound reasoning. This gap enables the LLM's powerful parametric priors to override new contextual facts, resulting in critical factual hallucinations (e.g., incorrectly reasoning "Houston" from "NASA" despite an explicit edit). To solve this core LLM alignment problem, we propose Reason-KE++, an SFT+RL framework that instills process-level faithfulness. Its core is a Stage-aware Reward mechanism that provides dense supervision for intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Decomposition, Sub-answer Correctness). Crucially, we identify that naive outcome-only RL is a deceptive trap for LLM alignment: it collapses reasoning integrity (e.g., 19.00% Hop acc) while superficially boosting final accuracy. Our process-aware framework sets a new SOTA of 95.48% on MQUAKE-CF-3k (+5.28%), demonstrating that for complex tasks, aligning the reasoning process is essential for building trustworthy LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种波斯语到英语的直接语音翻译系统，通过自监督预训练、离散语音单元和合成平行数据来解决低资源语言的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接语音翻译系统需要大量平行语音数据，但波斯语等低资源语言缺乏此类数据，因此需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用三个组件：基于conformer的编码器、因果transformer解码器和基于单元的神经声码器。通过大语言模型翻译波斯语转录并合成英语语音来构建平行语料库。

Result: 在CVSS语料库的波斯语-英语部分，使用合成数据比直接基线提高了4.6 ASR BLEU。

Conclusion: 结合自监督预训练、离散语音单元和合成平行数据能有效改善波斯语-英语等低资源语言对的直接语音翻译性能。

Abstract: Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), in which all components are trained jointly, is an attractive alternative to cascaded systems because it offers a simpler pipeline and lower inference latency. However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines. These results indicate that combining self-supervised pre-training, discrete speech units, and synthetic parallel data is effective for improving direct S2ST in low-resource language pairs such as Persian-English

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvoSynth是一个自主的进化合成框架，通过多智能体系统自主设计、进化和执行基于代码的新型攻击算法，突破了传统自动化红队框架只能选择、组合或优化现有攻击策略的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM自动化红队框架存在根本性局限：其越狱逻辑仅限于选择、组合或优化预先存在的攻击策略，这限制了它们的创造力，无法自主发明全新的攻击机制。

Method: EvoSynth采用多智能体系统，从攻击规划转向进化合成越狱方法。它通过代码级自校正循环，能够在失败时迭代重写自身的攻击逻辑，自主设计基于代码的新型攻击算法。

Result: 实验表明，EvoSynth在对抗高度鲁棒的模型（如Claude-Sonnet-4.5）时达到了85.5%的攻击成功率，创下了新的最先进水平，并且生成的攻击比现有方法更加多样化。

Conclusion: EvoSynth代表了越狱方法进化合成的新方向，通过自主发明新型攻击机制，显著提升了自动化红队的能力和创造力。

Abstract: Automated red teaming frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, yet they share a fundamental limitation: their jailbreak logic is confined to selecting, combining, or refining pre-existing attack strategies. This binds their creativity and leaves them unable to autonomously invent entirely new attack mechanisms. To overcome this gap, we introduce \textbf{EvoSynth}, an autonomous framework that shifts the paradigm from attack planning to the evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods. We release our framework to facilitate future research in this new direction of evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/dongdongunique/EvoSynth.

*Christopher Cruz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AFM是一种动态上下文管理器，通过三种保真度级别（完整、压缩、占位符）来优化多轮对话中的内存使用，在保持安全性能的同时将平均token使用量减少66%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在多轮对话中固定上下文窗口和简单内存策略的瓶颈问题，避免完整对话重放的高成本，同时防止静态摘要或仅关注最近对话导致关键安全细节丢失。

Method: AFM基于语义相似度、半衰期最近性权重和重要性分类，为每条历史消息分配三种保真度级别，在严格token预算下按时间顺序打包消息，优先为最相关轮次提供高保真度。

Result: 在涉及花生过敏用户规划泰国旅行的安全导向基准测试中，AFM在短中长度对话中都能保留过敏信息，安全性能与完整重放相当，同时平均token使用量比基线减少66%。

Conclusion: AFM提供了一个模块化的Python实现，可在不牺牲安全性或事实连续性的情况下显著降低推理成本，适用于OpenAI兼容API和离线操作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn dialogue settings, but their behavior is still bottlenecked by fixed context windows and naive memory strategies. Replaying the full conversation at every turn is simple but expensive, while static summarization or recency-only heuristics often erase safety-critical user details. We present Adaptive Focus Memory (AFM), a dynamic context manager that assigns each past message one of three fidelity levels -- FULL, COMPRESSED, or PLACEHOLDER -- based on semantic similarity to the current query, half-life recency weighting, and importance classification. AFM packs messages chronologically under a strict token budget, preferring high fidelity for the most relevant turns while aiming to preserve a cheap trace of the dialogue. In a safety-oriented benchmark involving a user with a severe peanut allergy planning a trip to Thailand, AFM retains the allergy across both short and medium-length conversations, matches the safety performance of naive replay, and cuts average token usage by 66% relative to a replay baseline. We release a modular Python implementation of AFM designed for OpenAI-compatible APIs and offline operation, enabling practitioners to reduce inference cost without sacrificing safety or factual continuity in the evaluated scenario.

TL;DR: LLMs在复杂推理任务上表现超人类，但在简单集合成员查询任务中却频繁失败，显示出其推理能力的脆弱性和不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在简单推理任务中的失败模式，以揭示其可靠性和可解释性方面的根本问题。通过集合成员查询这种基础推理形式，系统分析LLM的推理缺陷。

Method: 使用集合成员查询任务（如"苹果是否属于{梨,李子,苹果,覆盆子}集合？"），在提示措辞、语义结构、元素排序和模型选择等维度进行大规模系统性实证评估。

Result: LLM在这个基础任务上的表现始终脆弱且不可预测，表明模型对集合概念的理解是碎片化和复杂的。

Conclusion: 简单问题的大规模实验能够全面映射和分析LLM的失败模式，这种方法对LLM评估具有普遍价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve superhuman performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet often fail on much simpler problems, raising concerns about their reliability and interpretability. We investigate this paradox through a focused study with two key design features: simplicity, to expose basic failure modes, and scale, to enable comprehensive controlled experiments. We focus on set membership queries -- among the most fundamental forms of reasoning -- using tasks like ``Is apple an element of the set \{pear, plum, apple, raspberry\}?''. We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation across prompt phrasing, semantic structure, element ordering, and model choice. Our large-scale analysis reveals that LLM performance on this elementary task is consistently brittle, and unpredictable across all dimensions, suggesting that the models' ``understanding'' of the set concept is fragmented and convoluted at best. Our work demonstrates that the large-scale experiments enabled by the simplicity of the problem allow us to map and analyze the failure modes comprehensively, making this approach a valuable methodology for LLM evaluation in general.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究相变现象是否仅限于大型语言模型，能否在线性训练空间中直接检测，以及是否在训练早期阶段出现。

Method: 训练小型GPT风格transformer模型，通过词汇使用演变分析（平均词长、正确/错误词数、词汇多样性变化），并应用泊松和亚泊松统计量化词汇连接和重组。

Result: 在训练过程中发现明显的相变点，这些相变在标准损失或验证曲线中不明显，但通过词汇和统计探针变得可见。

Conclusion: 相变重组是语言模型训练的普遍特征，可在小型模型中观察到，在线性训练空间中可检测，并在训练早期出现，为理解语言模型训练的非线性动力学提供了新视角。

Abstract: Phase transitions have been proposed as the origin of emergent abilities in large language models (LLMs), where new capabilities appear abruptly once models surpass critical thresholds of scale. Prior work, such as that of Wei et al., demonstrated these phenomena under model and data scaling, with transitions revealed after applying a log scale to training compute. In this work, we ask three complementary questions: (1) Are phase transitions unique to large models, or can they also be observed in small transformer-based language models? (2) Can such transitions be detected directly in linear training space, rather than only after log rescaling? and (3) Can these transitions emerge at early stages of training? To investigate, we train a small GPT-style transformer on a character-level corpus and analyze the evolution of vocabulary usage throughout training. We track the average word length, the number of correct versus incorrect words, and shifts in vocabulary diversity. Building on these measures, we apply Poisson and sub-Poisson statistics to quantify how words connect and reorganize. This combined analysis reveals a distinct transition point during training. Notably, these transitions are not apparent in standard loss or validation curves, but become visible through our vocabulary- and statistics-based probes. Our findings suggest that phase-transition reorganizations are a general feature of language model training, observable even in modest models, detectable directly in linear training space, and occurring surprisingly early as coherence emerges. This perspective provides new insight into the nonlinear dynamics of language model training and underscores the importance of tailored metrics for uncovering phase transition behaviors

TL;DR: 提出使用中断机制来增强大语言模型的对齐性，通过在用户输入中定期插入控制语句来防止越狱行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐研究主要关注通过训练和提示来提高模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，但缺乏随着用户输入长度增加而增强对齐的方法。研究发现LLM越狱概率随用户输入或对话长度增加而上升。

Method: 提出中断机制——在用户输入中每隔x个token插入控制语句，并建议可将此方法推广到思维链过程中以防止策略性行为。

Result: 论文提出了中断机制的概念框架，但未提供具体的实验结果数据。

Conclusion: 中断机制是增强LLM对齐性的潜在解决方案，能够随着用户输入长度扩展而保持对齐效果。

Abstract: Current Large Language Model alignment research mostly focuses on improving model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on examples and prompting. Research has shown that LLM jailbreak probability increases with the size of the user input or conversation length. There is a lack of appropriate research into means of strengthening alignment which also scale with user input length. We propose interruptions as a possible solution to this problem. Interruptions are control sentences added to the user input approximately every x tokens for some arbitrary x. We suggest that this can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在自动形式化任务中对语义相似但表述不同的自然语言输入的敏感性，发现即使语义保持高度一致，模型输出仍会因表述变化而产生显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明LLMs在文本到SQL任务中对自然语言输入的改写敏感，本文旨在验证这种敏感性是否同样存在于自动形式化领域。

Method: 使用MiniF2F和ProofNet的Lean 4版本作为形式化基准，生成语义相似的自然语言改写语句，并在两个现代LLMs上进行交叉评估，测量语义有效性和编译有效性。

Result: 实验结果显示，模型在改写输入上的表现存在变异性，自然语言表述的微小变化会显著影响模型输出。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动形式化任务中对自然语言输入的表述变化敏感，这揭示了模型鲁棒性的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for autoformalization. Despite their impressive performance, these models can still struggle to produce grounded and verifiable formalizations. Recent work in text-to-SQL, has revealed that LLMs can be sensitive to paraphrased natural language (NL) inputs, even when high degrees of semantic fidelity are preserved (Safarzadeh, Oroojlooyjadid, and Roth 2025). In this paper, we investigate this claim in the autoformalization domain. Specifically, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs generating formal proofs with semantically similar paraphrased NL statements by measuring semantic and compilation validity. Using the formal benchmarks MiniF2F (Zheng, Han, and Polu 2021) and Lean 4 version of ProofNet (Xin et al. 2024), and two modern LLMs, we generate paraphrased natural language statements and cross-evaluate these statements across both models. The results of this paper reveal performance variability across paraphrased inputs, demonstrating that minor shifts in NL statements can significantly impact model outputs.

TL;DR: BioMedJImpact是一个大规模生物医学数据集，整合了174万篇PubMed Central文章的文献计量指标、合作特征和LLM衍生的AI参与度指标，用于分析合作强度和AI参与如何共同影响科学影响力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放资源很少捕捉合作结构和AI研究如何共同塑造生物医学期刊声望，需要开发一个综合数据集来推进期刊层面的科学影响力和AI参与度分析。

Method: 构建BioMedJImpact数据集，包含2744种期刊的174万篇文章，整合文献计量指标、合作特征，并通过可复现的三阶段LLM流程提取AI参与度特征。

Result: 发现两个一致趋势：合作强度更高的期刊（特别是拥有更大更多样化作者团队的期刊）获得更高引用影响力；AI参与度与期刊声望相关性日益增强，尤其在四分位数排名中。

Conclusion: BioMedJImpact既是捕捉生物医学与AI交叉的综合数据集，也是经过验证的方法框架，支持可扩展、内容感知的科学计量分析。

Abstract: Assessing journal impact is central to scholarly communication, yet existing open resources rarely capture how collaboration structures and artificial intelligence (AI) research jointly shape venue prestige in biomedicine. We present BioMedJImpact, a large-scale, biomedical-oriented dataset designed to advance journal-level analysis of scientific impact and AI engagement. Built from 1.74 million PubMed Central articles across 2,744 journals, BioMedJImpact integrates bibliometric indicators, collaboration features, and LLM-derived semantic indicators for AI engagement. Specifically, the AI engagement feature is extracted through a reproducible three-stage LLM pipeline that we propose. Using this dataset, we analyze how collaboration intensity and AI engagement jointly influence scientific impact across pre- and post-pandemic periods (2016-2019, 2020-2023). Two consistent trends emerge: journals with higher collaboration intensity, particularly those with larger and more diverse author teams, tend to achieve greater citation impact, and AI engagement has become an increasingly strong correlate of journal prestige, especially in quartile rankings. To further validate the three-stage LLM pipeline we proposed for deriving the AI engagement feature, we conduct human evaluation, confirming substantial agreement in AI relevance detection and consistent subfield classification. Together, these contributions demonstrate that BioMedJImpact serves as both a comprehensive dataset capturing the intersection of biomedicine and AI, and a validated methodological framework enabling scalable, content-aware scientometric analysis of scientific impact and innovation dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在对话流畅性方面不断提升，但赋予其细腻、人性化的情感表达仍是一个重大挑战。现有的对齐技术往往只处理表层输出或需要大量微调。

Method: 使用归因修补识别因果影响组件，通过对比文本对（正面vs负面情感示例）的激活差异推导情感表达向量，并将这些向量应用于新的对话提示。

Result: 引导后的响应显示出更高的积极情感（如喜悦、信任）和更频繁的第一人称代词使用，表明更强的个人参与度。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个精确且可解释的框架，为对话AI研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing conversational fluency, yet instilling them with nuanced, human-like emotional expression remains a significant challenge. Current alignment techniques often address surface-level output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions). Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment (e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of greater personal engagement. Our findings offer a precise and interpretable framework and new directions for the study of conversational AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的稳定性度量方法，用于评估LDA主题模型的可重复性和可靠性，通过生成带有真实主题的语料库来测试LDA在多次运行中的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率主题模型由于随机性在重新运行时会产生不同结果，导致潜在主题的不一致性，这影响了模型的可重复性、可靠性和解释性，引发了对主题模型是否真正捕捉到有意义主题还是仅仅是噪声的担忧。

Method: 定义了一个结合准确性和一致性的新稳定性度量方法，利用LDA的生成特性生成带有真实主题的新语料库，并将这些生成的语料库通过LDA运行50次以确定输出的变异性。

Result: 研究发现LDA能够正确确定文档中的基础主题数量，并且LDA在多次重新运行中返回相似主题，表现出更高的内部一致性，但这些主题并非真实主题。

Conclusion: LDA主题模型在确定主题数量方面表现准确，在内部一致性方面也较好，但生成的主题与真实主题存在差异，表明模型稳定性仍需改进。

Abstract: Topic modelling in Natural Language Processing uncovers hidden topics in large, unlabelled text datasets. It is widely applied in fields such as information retrieval, content summarisation, and trend analysis across various disciplines. However, probabilistic topic models can produce different results when rerun due to their stochastic nature, leading to inconsistencies in latent topics. Factors like corpus shuffling, rare text removal, and document elimination contribute to these variations. This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise. To address these problems, we defined a new stability measure that incorporates accuracy and consistency and uses the generative properties of LDA to generate a new corpus with ground truth. These generated corpora are run through LDA 50 times to determine the variability in the output. We show that LDA can correctly determine the underlying number of topics in the documents. We also find that LDA is more internally consistent, as the multiple reruns return similar topics; however, these topics are not the true topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用语言模型无法捕捉临床脑电图报告中的领域特定语言约定，需要专门针对EEG报告特点的模型。

Method: 使用哈佛脑电图数据库中的报告文本进行训练，采用span-corruption预训练和指令式微调，包括报告润色、段落摘要和术语问答。

Result: 相比同规模通用模型，NeuroLex实现了更低的困惑度、更高的提取和摘要准确度、更好的标签效率，以及对否定和事实幻觉更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NeuroLex为脑电图文本建模和脑机接口应用提供了桥梁，为可解释和语言驱动的神经解码奠定了基础。

Abstract: Clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) reports encode domain-specific linguistic conventions that general-purpose language models (LMs) fail to capture. We introduce NeuroLex, a lightweight domain-adaptive language model trained purely on EEG report text from the Harvard Electroencephalography Database. Unlike existing biomedical LMs, NeuroLex is tailored to the linguistic and diagnostic characteristics of EEG reporting, enabling it to serve as both an independent textual model and a decoder backbone for multimodal EEG-language systems. Using span-corruption pretraining and instruction-style fine-tuning on report polishing, paragraph summarization, and terminology question answering, NeuroLex learns the syntax and reasoning patterns characteristic of EEG interpretation. Comprehensive evaluations show that it achieves lower perplexity, higher extraction and summarization accuracy, better label efficiency, and improved robustness to negation and factual hallucination compared with general models of the same scale. With an EEG-aware linguistic backbone, NeuroLex bridges biomedical text modeling and brain-computer interface applications, offering a foundation for interpretable and language-driven neural decoding.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in perception tasks, enhancing their complex reasoning capabilities has emerged as a critical research focus. Existing models still suffer from challenges such as opaque reasoning paths and insufficient generalization ability. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which has demonstrated significant efficacy in language models by enhancing reasoning transparency and output interpretability, holds promise for improving model reasoning capabilities when extended to the multimodal domain. This paper provides a systematic review centered on "Multimodal Chain-of-Thought" (MCoT). First, it analyzes the background and theoretical motivations for its inception from the perspectives of technical evolution and task demands. Then, it introduces mainstream MCoT methods from three aspects: CoT paradigms, the post-training stage, and the inference stage, while also analyzing their underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper summarizes existing evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and discusses the application scenarios of MCoT. Finally, it analyzes the challenges currently facing MCoT and provides an outlook on its future research directions.

Motivation: 开发一个计算框架来分析文本中的希望表达，应用于心理健康和社交媒体分析领域，同时探索不同架构在专门情感检测任务中的适用性。

Method: 使用三种Transformer架构（BERT、GPT-2、DeBERTa）进行二元分类（希望vs非希望）和多类别分类（五个希望相关类别），比较它们的准确率和计算效率。

Result: BERT表现最优（二元分类84.49%，多类别72.03%），且计算效率最高（训练时间443s）。GPT-2准确率最低（79.34%二元，71.29%多类别），但讽刺检测能力强（召回率92.46%）。DeBERTa表现中等但计算成本高（多类别训练947s）。

Conclusion: 对于专门的情感检测任务，架构的适用性可能比模型大小更重要，BERT在希望表达分类中提供了最佳的性能与效率平衡。

Abstract: This paper presents a transformer-based approach for classifying hope expressions in text. We developed and compared three architectures (BERT, GPT-2, and DeBERTa) for both binary classification (Hope vs. Not Hope) and multiclass categorization (five hope-related categories). Our initial BERT implementation achieved 83.65% binary and 74.87% multiclass accuracy. In the extended comparison, BERT demonstrated superior performance (84.49% binary, 72.03% multiclass accuracy) while requiring significantly fewer computational resources (443s vs. 704s training time) than newer architectures. GPT-2 showed lowest overall accuracy (79.34% binary, 71.29% multiclass), while DeBERTa achieved moderate results (80.70% binary, 71.56% multiclass) but at substantially higher computational cost (947s for multiclass training). Error analysis revealed architecture-specific strengths in detecting nuanced hope expressions, with GPT-2 excelling at sarcasm detection (92.46% recall). This study provides a framework for computational analysis of hope, with applications in mental health and social media analysis, while demonstrating that architectural suitability may outweigh model size for specialized emotion detection tasks.

Through a systematic algorithm audit of 1,508 real baby care and pregnancy-related queries, we evaluate the quality and consistency of these information displays. Our robust evaluation framework assesses multiple quality dimensions, including answer consistency, relevance, presence of medical safeguards, source categories, and sentiment alignment. Our results reveal concerning gaps in information consistency, with information in AIO and FS displayed on the same search result page being inconsistent with each other in 33% of cases. Despite high relevance scores, both features critically lack medical safeguards (present in just 11% of AIO and 7% of FS responses). While health and wellness websites dominate source categories for both, AIO and FS, FS also often link to commercial sources. These findings have important implications for public health information access and demonstrate the need for stronger quality controls in AI-mediated health information. Our methodology provides a transferable framework for auditing AI systems across high-stakes domains where information quality directly impacts user well-being.

### [353] [Visual Room 2.0: Seeing is Not Understanding for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12928)
*Haokun Li,Yazhou Zhang,Jizhi Ding,Qiuchi Li,Peng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Visual Room 2.0基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型的感知-认知对齐，发现MLLMs的感知能力优于认知能力，且认知不依赖于感知推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Searle的中文房间思想扩展到多模态领域，质疑MLLMs是否能真正理解所见内容，即"看到不等于理解"。

Method: 构建包含3个层次、17个任务的层次化基准，涵盖从属性识别到场景理解的感知任务，以及从文本蕴含到因果和社会推理的认知任务，包含350个多模态样本和2100个问题。

Result: 评估10个SOTA MLLMs发现：(1)感知能力比认知能力强8.0%；(2)认知不因果依赖于感知推理；(3)认知随模型规模扩展，但感知能力不随模型变大而一致提升。

Conclusion: 将"看到不等于理解"操作化为可测试假设，为MLLMs从感知处理到认知推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Can multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) truly understand what they can see? Extending Searle's Chinese Room into the multi-modal domain, this paper proposes the Visual Room argument: MLLMs may describe every visual detail precisely yet fail to comprehend the underlying emotions and intentions, namely seeing is not understanding. Building on this, we introduce \textit{Visual Room} 2.0, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating perception-cognition alignment of MLLMs. We model human perceptive and cognitive processes across three levels: low, middle, and high, covering 17 representative tasks. The perception component ranges from attribute recognition to scene understanding, while the cognition component extends from textual entailment to causal and social reasoning. The dataset contains 350 multi-modal samples, each with six progressive questions (2,100 in total) spanning perception to cognition. Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs, we highlight three key findings: (1) MLLMs exhibit stronger perceptual competence than cognitive ability (8.0\%$\uparrow$); (2) cognition appears not causally dependent on perception-based reasoning; and (3) cognition scales with model size, but perception does not consistently improve with larger variants. This work operationalizes Seeing $\ne$ Understanding as a testable hypothesis, offering a new paradigm from perceptual processing to cognitive reasoning in MLLMs. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LHK2003/PCBench.

*Zeyu Shi,Ziming Wang,Tianyu Chen,Shiqi Gao,Haoyi Zhou,Qingyun Sun,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HCNR方法通过识别和恢复关键表达控制神经元来修复SFT对LLM诚实性的损害，相比基线方法在恢复33.25%诚实性的同时实现至少2.23倍加速和10倍数据减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调严重损害了LLM的诚实性，这对高风险领域的安全部署至关重要。现有恢复方法假设SFT深度破坏了模型识别知识边界的能力，但实际观察发现微调后的LLM仍保留此能力，受损的是其忠实表达这种意识的能力。

Method: 提出Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR)，通过识别和恢复关键表达控制神经元到预训练状态，同时通过Hessian引导的补偿机制将这些神经元与任务导向神经元协调。

Result: 在四个QA任务和五个LLM家族上的实验表明，HCNR有效恢复了33.25%受损的诚实性，同时相比基线方法实现至少2.23倍加速和超过10倍的数据减少。

Conclusion: HCNR为可信LLM部署提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够高效恢复模型诚实性而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: The honesty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important for safe deployment in high-stakes domains. However, this crucial trait is severely undermined by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), a common technique for model specialization. Existing recovery methods rely on data-intensive global parameter adjustments, implicitly assuming that SFT deeply corrupts the models' ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries. However, we observe that fine-tuned LLMs still preserve this ability; what is damaged is their capacity to faithfully express that awareness. Building on this, we propose Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR) to surgically repair this suppressed capacity. HCNR identifies and restores key expression-governing neurons to their pre-trained state while harmonizing them with task-oriented neurons via Hessian-guided compensation. Experiments on four QA tasks and five LLM families demonstrate that HCNR effectively recovers 33.25% of the compromised honesty while achieving at least 2.23x speedup with over 10x less data compared to baseline methods, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AA-Omniscience是一个评估语言模型事实性召回和知识校准的基准，包含6000个问题，覆盖6个领域42个经济相关主题。评估结果显示前沿模型在事实性和校准方面存在持续弱点，Claude 4.1 Opus得分最高(4.8)，只有三个模型得分超过零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估主要衡量通用能力，但在各领域可靠使用需要事实准确性和知识缺口识别能力。需要专门评估模型的事实召回和知识校准。

Method: 开发AA-Omniscience基准，包含来自权威学术和行业来源的6000个问题，覆盖6个领域42个经济相关主题。使用全知指数(-100到100)评估模型，该指标同时惩罚幻觉并在不确定时奖励弃权。

Result: Claude 4.1 Opus获得最高分(4.8)，是仅有的三个得分超过零的模型之一。不同研究实验室的模型在六个领域各有领先，表现存在领域差异性。

Conclusion: 前沿模型在事实性和校准方面存在持续弱点。由于模型在不同领域表现各异，对于知识密集型任务，应根据具体用例需求选择模型而非依赖通用性能。

Abstract: Existing language model evaluations primarily measure general capabilities, yet reliable use of these models across a range of domains demands factual accuracy and recognition of knowledge gaps. We introduce AA-Omniscience, a benchmark designed to measure both factual recall and knowledge calibration across 6,000 questions. Questions are derived from authoritative academic and industry sources, and cover 42 economically relevant topics within six different domains. The evaluation measures a model's Omniscience Index, a bounded metric (-100 to 100) measuring factual recall that jointly penalizes hallucinations and rewards abstention when uncertain, with 0 equating to a model that answers questions correctly as much as it does incorrectly. Among evaluated models, Claude 4.1 Opus attains the highest score (4.8), making it one of only three models to score above zero. These results reveal persistent factuality and calibration weaknesses across frontier models. Performance also varies by domain, with the models from three different research labs leading across the six domains. This performance variability suggests models should be chosen according to the demands of the use case rather than general performance for tasks where knowledge is important.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多语言嵌入模型与对齐单语模型在双语词典归纳(BLI)任务中的表现对比，分析了BLI作为嵌入空间对齐度评估指标的局限性，并提出基于词干的新BLI方法和词汇剪枝技术来改进评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多语言嵌入已成为主流选择，但需要验证其是否在所有方面都优于对齐单语模型，以及其更高的计算成本是否总是合理。研究旨在探索BLI作为评估指标的局限性，并比较不同嵌入对齐技术在高低资源语言环境下的表现。

Method: 使用双语词典归纳(BLI)作为评估指标，比较传统嵌入对齐技术、新型多语言模型和组合对齐技术的表现。提出基于词干的BLI方法和词汇剪枝技术来改进评估。分析语言家族对BLI结果的影响。

Result: 发现BLI在某些情况下不能准确衡量嵌入空间的对齐程度。组合嵌入对齐技术通常表现更好，但在某些情况下(主要是低资源语言)多语言嵌入表现更优。提出的新方法能更准确地评估对齐度。

Conclusion: 多语言嵌入和对齐单语模型各有优势，没有绝对的胜利者。BLI作为评估指标存在局限性，需要改进的评估方法来更准确地衡量嵌入空间的对齐程度。

Abstract: Sans a dwindling number of monolingual embedding studies originating predominantly from the low-resource domains, it is evident that multilingual embedding has become the de facto choice due to its adaptability to the usage of code-mixed languages, granting the ability to process multilingual documents in a language-agnostic manner, as well as removing the difficult task of aligning monolingual embeddings. But is this victory complete? Are the multilingual models better than aligned monolingual models in every aspect? Can the higher computational cost of multilingual models always be justified? Or is there a compromise between the two extremes? Bilingual Lexicon Induction is one of the most widely used metrics in terms of evaluating the degree of alignment between two embedding spaces. In this study, we explore the strengths and limitations of BLI as a measure to evaluate the degree of alignment of two embedding spaces. Further, we evaluate how well traditional embedding alignment techniques, novel multilingual models, and combined alignment techniques perform BLI tasks in the contexts of both high-resource and low-resource languages. In addition to that, we investigate the impact of the language families to which the pairs of languages belong. We identify that BLI does not measure the true degree of alignment in some cases and we propose solutions for them. We propose a novel stem-based BLI approach to evaluate two aligned embedding spaces that take into account the inflected nature of languages as opposed to the prevalent word-based BLI techniques. Further, we introduce a vocabulary pruning technique that is more informative in showing the degree of the alignment, especially performing BLI on multilingual embedding models. Often, combined embedding alignment techniques perform better while in certain cases multilingual embeddings perform better (mainly low-resource language cases).

TL;DR: Spark-Prover-X1-7B是一个7B参数的定理证明模型，通过三阶段训练框架在数学推理任务上达到SOTA性能，在PutnamBench上解决27个问题，CombiBench上达到24.0%通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在自动定理证明中因缺乏多样化和高质量形式语言数据而受限的问题，探索中等规模LLMs的推理潜力。

Method: 三阶段训练框架：1) 在广泛数学语料上进行持续预训练，引入"思维链增强状态预测"任务；2) 在专家迭代循环中进行监督微调；3) 应用组相对策略优化(GRPO)针对最具挑战性问题。

Result: Spark-Prover-X1-7B在类似规模开源模型中达到SOTA，平均通过率37.0%(pass@32)，在PutnamBench上解决27个问题，CombiBench上达到24.0%(pass@32)。

Conclusion: 多样化的训练数据和渐进精炼的训练流水线为增强轻量级LLMs的形式推理能力提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in automated theorem proving, yet progress is often constrained by the scarcity of diverse and high-quality formal language data. To address this issue, we introduce Spark-Prover-X1, a 7B parameter model trained via an three-stage framework designed to unlock the reasoning potential of more accessible and moderately-sized LLMs. The first stage infuses deep knowledge through continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus, enhanced by a suite of novel data tasks. Key innovation is a "CoT-augmented state prediction" task to achieve fine-grained reasoning. The second stage employs Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) within an expert iteration loop to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B models. Finally, a targeted round of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to sharpen the prover's capabilities on the most challenging problems. To facilitate robust evaluation, particularly on problems from real-world examinations, we also introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems. Experimental results demonstrate that Spark-Prover-X1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly-sized open-source models, attaining a 37.0\% average pass rate (pass@32). It shows exceptional performance on difficult competition benchmarks, notably solving 27 problems on PutnamBench (pass@32) and achieving 24.0\% on CombiBench (pass@32). Our work validates that this diverse training data and progressively refined training pipeline provides an effective path for enhancing the formal reasoning capabilities of lightweight LLMs. Both Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B, along with the ExamFormal-Bench dataset, are made publicly available at:https://www.modelscope.cn/organization/iflytek, https://gitcode.com/ifly_opensource.

TL;DR: BeDiscovER是一个评估现代大语言模型话语理解能力的综合基准套件，包含5个话语任务和52个数据集，涵盖词汇、句子和文档层面。评估发现先进模型在时间推理的算术方面表现良好，但在完整文档推理和微妙语义现象方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理语言模型的发展，需要建立一个全面评估话语层面知识的基准套件，以测试模型在话语理解方面的能力。

Method: 整合5个公开可用的话语任务，包括话语词典、(多)句子和文档层面，总共52个数据集，涵盖话语解析、时间关系提取、话语粒子消歧等任务。

Result: 评估显示最先进模型在时间推理的算术方面表现强劲，但在完整文档推理和修辞关系识别等微妙语义现象方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 现代LLM在话语理解方面仍有局限，特别是在文档级推理和微妙语义现象处理上需要进一步改进。

Abstract: We introduce BeDiscovER (Benchmark of Discourse Understanding in the Era of Reasoning Language Models), an up-to-date, comprehensive suite for evaluating the discourse-level knowledge of modern LLMs. BeDiscovER compiles 5 publicly available discourse tasks across discourse lexicon, (multi-)sentential, and documental levels, with in total 52 individual datasets. It covers both extensively studied tasks such as discourse parsing and temporal relation extraction, as well as some novel challenges such as discourse particle disambiguation (e.g., ``just''), and also aggregates a shared task on Discourse Relation Parsing and Treebanking for multilingual and multi-framework discourse relation classification. We evaluate open-source LLMs: Qwen3 series, DeepSeek-R1, and frontier model such as GPT-5-mini on BeDiscovER, and find that state-of-the-art models exhibit strong performance in arithmetic aspect of temporal reasoning, but they struggle with full document reasoning and some subtle semantic and discourse phenomena, such as rhetorical relation recognition.

TL;DR: 评估当代LLMs在零样本设置下识别随机对照试验对CONSORT 2010声明依从性的准确性，发现整体性能一般，能较好识别合规项目但难以检测不合规和不适用的项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动验证CONSORT依从性耗时费力，是同行评审和证据合成的瓶颈，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 构建包含150篇已发表RCT的金标准数据集，在零样本设置下评估LLMs的三分类任务性能，使用宏平均F1分数和Cohen's Kappa系数作为主要指标。

Result: 最佳模型Gemini-2.5-Flash和DeepSeek-R1的宏F1分数为0.634，Kappa系数约0.28，仅达到一般一致性。模型在识别合规项目时准确率高（F1>0.85），但在识别不合规和不适用的项目时表现差（F1<0.40）。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力作为CONSORT检查的初步筛选助手，能够识别报告良好的项目，但目前无法可靠检测报告遗漏或方法学缺陷，不能替代人类专家在试验质量评估中的作用。

Abstract: The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement is the global benchmark for transparent and high-quality reporting of randomized controlled trials. Manual verification of CONSORT adherence is a laborious, time-intensive process that constitutes a significant bottleneck in peer review and evidence synthesis. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the accuracy and reliability of contemporary LLMs in identifying the adherence of published RCTs to the CONSORT 2010 statement under a zero-shot setting. We constructed a golden standard dataset of 150 published RCTs spanning diverse medical specialties. The primary outcome was the macro-averaged F1-score for the three-class classification task, supplemented by item-wise performance metrics and qualitative error analysis. Overall model performance was modest. The top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Flash and DeepSeek-R1, achieved nearly identical macro F1 scores of 0.634 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients of 0.280 and 0.282, respectively, indicating only fair agreement with expert consensus. A striking performance disparity was observed across classes: while most models could identify compliant items with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.850), they struggled profoundly with identifying non-compliant and not applicable items, where F1 scores rarely exceeded 0.400. Notably, some high-profile models like GPT-4o underperformed, achieving a macro F1-score of only 0.521. LLMs show potential as preliminary screening assistants for CONSORT checks, capably identifying well-reported items. However, their current inability to reliably detect reporting omissions or methodological flaws makes them unsuitable for replacing human expertise in the critical appraisal of trial quality.

TL;DR: Agent-Event-Coder (AEC) 是一个多智能体框架，将零样本事件抽取转化为类似软件工程的代码生成过程，通过检索、规划、编码和验证四个专业子任务实现精确的事件抽取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在零样本事件抽取中面临的复杂推理和领域特定理解挑战，避免直接提示导致的不完整或结构无效输出（如错误分类触发器、缺失参数和模式违规）。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，将事件抽取分解为四个专业子任务：检索、规划、编码和验证，每个任务由专门的LLM智能体处理，事件模式表示为可执行的类定义以实现确定性验证。

Result: 在五个不同领域和六个LLM上的实验表明，AEC持续优于先前的零样本基线方法，展示了将事件抽取视为代码生成方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过编程启发的方法和协作智能体工作流，AEC使LLM能够在零样本设置中产生精确、完整且模式一致的事件抽取结果。

Abstract: Zero-shot event extraction (ZSEE) remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for complex reasoning and domain-specific understanding. Direct prompting often yields incomplete or structurally invalid outputs--such as misclassified triggers, missing arguments, and schema violations. To address these limitations, we present Agent-Event-Coder (AEC), a novel multi-agent framework that treats event extraction like software engineering: as a structured, iterative code-generation process. AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement. By leveraging collaborative agent workflows, AEC enables LLMs to produce precise, complete, and schema-consistent extractions in zero-shot settings. Experiments across five diverse domains and six LLMs demonstrate that AEC consistently outperforms prior zero-shot baselines, showcasing the power of treating event extraction like code generation. The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/Agent-Event-Coder.

Motivation: 系统比较循环神经网络和注意力机制在手语识别中的性能差异，为不同应用场景下的架构选择提供指导。

Method: 在阿塞拜疆手语数据集(AzSLD)和美国手语词汇级数据集(WLASL)上实现并评估ConvLSTM和Vanilla Transformer两种代表性模型。

Result: Vanilla Transformer在两个数据集上的Top-1和Top-5准确率均优于ConvLSTM，在AzSLD上达到76.8% Top-1准确率，在WLASL上达到88.3%。ConvLSTM计算效率更高但在小数据集上准确率较低。

Conclusion: Transformer在整体准确率和说话者独立性方面表现更优，而ConvLSTM在计算效率和时序建模方面有优势。研究为不同应用需求和资源限制下的架构选择提供了权衡分析。

Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of recurrent and attention-based neural architectures for isolated sign language recognition. We implement and evaluate two representative models-ConvLSTM and Vanilla Transformer-on the Azerbaijani Sign Language Dataset (AzSLD) and the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) dataset. Our results demonstrate that the attention-based Vanilla Transformer consistently outperforms the recurrent ConvLSTM in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy across datasets, achieving up to 76.8% Top-1 accuracy on AzSLD and 88.3% on WLASL. The ConvLSTM, while more computationally efficient, lags in recognition accuracy, particularly on smaller datasets. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of each paradigm: the Transformer excels in overall accuracy and signer independence, whereas the ConvLSTM offers advantages in computational efficiency and temporal modeling. The study provides a nuanced analysis of these trade-offs, offering guidance for architecture selection in sign language recognition systems depending on application requirements and resource constraints.

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本语法能力评估框架，利用未标记数据和大型语言模型生成伪标签，无需人工标注即可训练基于Transformer的语法评分模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语语法评估面临自发、非结构化和不流畅的挑战，且专家标注成本高昂，难以大规模创建数据。

Method: 使用基于语法能力量表的提示让LLM在未标记数据上生成预测作为伪标签，通过专门设计的训练框架处理标签噪声来训练Transformer模型。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能高精度估计语法能力分数，LLM选择和干净-噪声样本比例对性能有重要影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展、低资源的语法评估系统提供了有效途径，具有鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Grammar competency estimation is essential for assessing linguistic proficiency in both written and spoken language; however, the spoken modality presents additional challenges due to its spontaneous, unstructured, and disfluent nature. Developing accurate grammar scoring models further requires extensive expert annotation, making large-scale data creation impractical. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-shot grammar competency estimation framework that leverages unlabeled data and Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on manual labels. During training, we employ LLM-generated predictions on unlabeled data by using grammar competency rubric-based prompts. These predictions, treated as pseudo labels, are utilized to train a transformer-based model through a novel training framework designed to handle label noise effectively. We show that the choice of LLM for pseudo-label generation critically affects model performance and that the ratio of clean-to-noisy samples during training strongly influences stability and accuracy. Finally, a qualitative analysis of error intensity and score prediction confirms the robustness and interpretability of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in estimating grammar competency scores with high accuracy, paving the way for scalable, low-resource grammar assessment systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决孟加拉语ASR转录中词重复的歧义问题：区分无意的不流畅重复和故意的语法构造重复，避免标准不流畅修正方法误删有效语言信息。

Method: 创建了20,000行手动标注的孟加拉语语料库，使用两种方法进行基准测试：多语言大语言模型的少样本提示和任务特定编码器模型的微调。

Result: 多语言LLM在少样本提示下达到82.68%准确率，但微调方法表现更优，BanglaBERT模型达到84.78%准确率和0.677 F1分数。

Conclusion: 为孟加拉语建立了强大的语言感知基线，为开发语义保持的文本规范化系统提供了关键数据。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, contain a critical ambiguity: word-word repetitions can be either Repetition Disfluency (unintentional ASR error/hesitation) or Morphological Reduplication (a deliberate grammatical construct). Standard disfluency correction fails by erroneously deleting valid linguistic information. To solve this, we introduce the first publicly available, 20,000-row Bangla corpus, manually annotated to explicitly distinguish between these two phenomena in noisy ASR transcripts. We benchmark this novel resource using two paradigms: state-of-the-art multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) and task-specific fine-tuning of encoder models. LLMs achieve competitive performance (up to 82.68\% accuracy) with few-shot prompting. However, fine-tuning proves superior, with the language-specific BanglaBERT model achieving the highest accuracy of 84.78\% and an F1 score of 0.677. This establishes a strong, linguistically-informed baseline and provides essential data for developing sophisticated, semantic-preserving text normalization systems for Bangla.

TL;DR: TCM-5CEval是一个更细粒度的中医领域大语言模型评估基准，从五个关键维度评估模型能力，揭示了模型在推理稳定性方面的根本弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在通用领域表现出色，但在中医等高度专业化和文化丰富的领域中需要更严谨和细致的评估。

Method: 构建TCM-5CEval基准，从核心知识、经典素养、临床决策、中药学和临床非药物疗法五个维度评估15个主流LLM，并进行排列一致性测试。

Result: 发现模型在基础知识回忆方面表现良好，但在经典文本解释方面存在困难。排列一致性测试显示所有模型都对选项顺序敏感，表现出推理脆弱性。

Conclusion: TCM-5CEval不仅提供了更详细的中医能力诊断工具，还暴露了模型推理稳定性的根本弱点，为后续研究和标准化比较提供了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in general domains, yet their application in highly specialized and culturally-rich fields like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) requires rigorous and nuanced evaluation. Building upon prior foundational work such as TCM-3CEval, which highlighted systemic knowledge gaps and the importance of cultural-contextual alignment, we introduce TCM-5CEval, a more granular and comprehensive benchmark. TCM-5CEval is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions: (1) Core Knowledge (TCM-Exam), (2) Classical Literacy (TCM-LitQA), (3) Clinical Decision-making (TCM-MRCD), (4) Chinese Materia Medica (TCM-CMM), and (5) Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy (TCM-ClinNPT). We conducted a thorough evaluation of fifteen prominent LLMs, revealing significant performance disparities and identifying top-performing models like deepseek\_r1 and gemini\_2\_5\_pro. Our findings show that while models exhibit proficiency in recalling foundational knowledge, they struggle with the interpretative complexities of classical texts. Critically, permutation-based consistency testing reveals widespread fragilities in model inference. All evaluated models, including the highest-scoring ones, displayed a substantial performance degradation when faced with varied question option ordering, indicating a pervasive sensitivity to positional bias and a lack of robust understanding. TCM-5CEval not only provides a more detailed diagnostic tool for LLM capabilities in TCM but aldso exposes fundamental weaknesses in their reasoning stability. To promote further research and standardized comparison, TCM-5CEval has been uploaded to the Medbench platform, joining its predecessor in the "In-depth Challenge for Comprehensive TCM Abilities" special track.

Method: 通过替换句子中的特定标记并观察翻译结果是否相同，计算翻译熵。分析多个句子中特定标记被替换后仍保持翻译不变的概率。

Result: 该方法可以量化排名多个公开翻译器，揭示翻译熵在解码器块中增强，并发现双标记替换时翻译退化呈乘积效应。

Conclusion: 翻译熵是可测量的属性，为人工翻译器提供了客观的基准测试方法。

Abstract: The translation of written language has been known since the 3rd century BC; however, its necessity has become increasingly common in the information age. Today, many translators exist, based on encoder-decoder deep architectures, nevertheless, no quantitative objective methods are available to assess their performance, likely because the entropy of even a single language remains unknown. This study presents a quantitative method for estimating translation entropy, with the following key finding. Given a translator, several sentences that differ by only one selected token of a given pivot sentence yield identical translations. Analyzing the statistics of this phenomenon across an ensemble of such sentences, consisting each of a pivot selected token, yields the probabilities of replacing this specific token with others while preserving the translation. These probabilities constitute the entropy of the selected token, and the average across all selected pivot tokens provides an estimate of the translator's overall translation entropy, which is enhanced along the decoder blocks. This entropic measure allows for the quantitative ranking of several publicly available translators and reveals whether mutual translation entropy is symmetric. Extending the proposed method to include the replacement of two tokens in a given pivot sentence demonstrates a multiplicative effect, where translation degeneracy is proportional to the product of the degeneracies of the two tokens. These findings establish translation entropy as a measurable property and objective benchmarking of artificial translators. Results are based on MarianMT, T5-Base and NLLB-200 translators.

Abstract: Automatic diacritic restoration is crucial for text processing in languages with rich diacritical marks, such as Romanian. This study evaluates the performance of several large language models (LLMs) in restoring diacritics in Romanian texts. Using a comprehensive corpus, we tested models including OpenAI's GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Google's Gemini 1.0 Pro, Meta's Llama 2 and Llama 3, MistralAI's Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, airoboros 70B, and OpenLLM-Ro's RoLlama 2 7B, under multiple prompt templates ranging from zero-shot to complex multi-shot instructions. Results show that models such as GPT-4o achieve high diacritic restoration accuracy, consistently surpassing a neutral echo baseline, while others, including Meta's Llama family, exhibit wider variability. These findings highlight the impact of model architecture, training data, and prompt design on diacritic restoration performance and outline promising directions for improving NLP tools for diacritic-rich languages.

TL;DR: 本文评估了视觉语言模型在语音识别任务中的表现，发现它们难以准确解读语音频谱图和波形图，即使经过微调也表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的发展，需要评估它们在多模态任务中的能力，特别是在语音识别领域作为专业语音学家的潜力。

Method: 创建了一个包含4000多个英语单词的数据集，包含语音频谱图和波形图，通过多项选择任务测试模型识别正确音素或字素转录的能力。

Result: 无论是零样本还是微调后的模型，其表现都很少超过随机猜测水平，表明模型缺乏解读语音图像的专业知识。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型需要特定的参数化知识来解读语音图像，仅靠配对样本训练是不够的。

Abstract: With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their vision-enabled counterparts (VLMs), numerous works have investigated their capabilities in tasks that fuse the modalities of vision and language. In this work, we benchmark the extent to which VLMs are able to act as highly-trained phoneticians, interpreting spectrograms and waveforms of speech. To do this, we synthesise a novel dataset containing 4k+ English words spoken in isolation alongside stylistically consistent spectrogram and waveform figures. We test the ability of VLMs to understand these representations of speech through a multiple-choice task whereby models must predict the correct phonemic or graphemic transcription of a spoken word when presented amongst 3 distractor transcriptions that have been selected based on their phonemic edit distance to the ground truth. We observe that both zero-shot and finetuned models rarely perform above chance, demonstrating the requirement for specific parametric knowledge of how to interpret such figures, rather than paired samples alone.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练成本高昂，模型融合（model souping）作为一种无需重新训练就能提升性能的技术具有重要价值，但现有均匀平均方法未能充分利用模型在不同类别任务上的专长。

Method: 提出SoCE方法：1）利用基准测试组合识别最优模型候选；2）基于类别间低相关性观察，识别每个弱相关类别簇的专家模型；3）使用优化的非均匀加权平均而非均匀权重进行模型融合。

Result: 该方法在多项领域（多语言能力、工具调用、数学等）提升了性能和鲁棒性，在伯克利函数调用排行榜上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: SoCE通过有原则的模型融合方法，有效利用不同模型在特定任务类别上的专长，为资源高效的模型性能提升提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, but their training remains resource- and time-intensive, requiring massive compute power and careful orchestration of training procedures. Model souping-the practice of averaging weights from multiple models of the same architecture-has emerged as a promising pre- and post-training technique that can enhance performance without expensive retraining. In this paper, we introduce Soup Of Category Experts (SoCE), a principled approach for model souping that utilizes benchmark composition to identify optimal model candidates and applies non-uniform weighted averaging to maximize performance. Contrary to previous uniform-averaging approaches, our method leverages the observation that benchmark categories often exhibit low inter-correlations in model performance. SoCE identifies "expert" models for each weakly-correlated category cluster and combines them using optimized weighted averaging rather than uniform weights. We demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance and robustness across multiple domains, including multilingual capabilities, tool calling, and math and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard.

Motivation: 现有的EaaS水印方法只能抵抗部分攻击，无法提供全面保护，导致模型提取攻击可能造成重大经济损失。

Method: 使用秘密降维矩阵投影到子空间，随机选择触发区域，在整个触发区域嵌入水印，并使用文本嵌入本身作为水印。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，RegionMarker能有效抵抗不同攻击方法。

Conclusion: RegionMarker通过区域触发语义水印框架，成功保护了EaaS的版权，抵抗了多种攻击方法。

Abstract: Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) is an effective and convenient deployment solution for addressing various NLP tasks. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS.

TL;DR: 研究通过PEFT/LoRA微调探索LLMs在任务和语言间的迁移模式，发现跨语言任务迁移呈正效应，而跨任务迁移常导致性能下降，揭示了任务-语言迁移的不对称性和稳定的捐赠-接收结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在一个任务或语言上的改进如何影响其他任务和语言及其组合，目前仍缺乏系统研究。

Method: 采用控制性PEFT/LoRA研究，在多个开源LLM家族和规模上进行，将任务和语言作为迁移轴，对每个模型在单一任务-语言源上进行微调，并测量在所有其他任务-语言目标对上的迁移效果。

Result: 发现两个一致模式：1) 任务内跨语言迁移可靠为正，而跨任务迁移常导致性能下降；2) 跨语言和任务存在稳定的捐赠-接收结构（枢纽捐赠者vs脆弱接收者）。

Conclusion: 研究结果为风险感知微调和模型专业化提供了重要启示，强调了任务-语言迁移的不对称性和稳定的捐赠-接收模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly across tasks and languages, yet how improvements in one task or language affect other tasks and languages and their combinations remains poorly understood. We conduct a controlled PEFT/LoRA study across multiple open-weight LLM families and sizes, treating task and language as transfer axes while conditioning on model family and size; we fine-tune each model on a single task-language source and measure transfer as the percentage-point change versus its baseline score when evaluated on all other task-language target pairs. We decompose transfer into (i) Matched-Task (Cross-Language), (ii) Matched-Language (Cross-Task), and (iii) Cross-Task (Cross-Language) regimes. We uncover two consistent general patterns. First, a pronounced on-task vs. off-task asymmetry: Matched-Task (Cross-Language) transfer is reliably positive, whereas off-task transfer often incurs collateral degradation. Second, a stable donor-recipient structure across languages and tasks (hub donors vs. brittle recipients). We outline implications for risk-aware fine-tuning and model specialisation.

TL;DR: PEDIASBench评估框架对12个大型语言模型在儿科医疗中的表现进行了系统评估，发现当前模型在基础知识方面表现良好，但在复杂推理、动态诊疗和人文关怀方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医学领域的快速发展，需要评估它们是否能在真实临床环境中胜任儿科医生的工作。

Method: 开发了PEDIASBench评估框架，从基础知识应用、动态诊疗能力、儿科医疗安全与伦理三个维度，对12个代表性模型在19个儿科亚专科和211种典型疾病上进行评估。

Result: 最先进模型在基础知识方面表现良好（Qwen3-235B-A22B在执业水平问题上准确率超90%），但随着任务复杂度增加性能下降约15%；在动态诊疗场景中，DeepSeek-R1在病例推理中得分最高（平均0.58），但多数模型难以适应实时患者变化；在医疗伦理安全任务中，Qwen2.5-72B表现最佳（准确率92.05%），但人文敏感性仍有限。

Conclusion: 当前儿科LLMs受限于有限的动态决策能力和未充分发展的人文关怀，未来应关注多模态整合和临床反馈-模型迭代循环，以增强安全性、可解释性和人机协作。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.

Motivation: 随着智能个人设备的普及，需要能够理解用户特定特征并个性化响应的对话助手，但现有方法往往忽略长期交互的复杂性和用户主观特征。

Method: 开发了多步骤LLM合成流程创建PAL-Set数据集，并提出H²Memory分层异构记忆框架，结合检索增强生成来改进个性化响应生成。

Result: 在PAL-Bench和外部数据集上的综合实验证明了所提记忆框架的有效性。

Conclusion: PAL-Bench为评估服务导向助手的个性化能力提供了新基准，H²Memory框架显著提升了长期用户-代理交互中的个性化服务能力。

Abstract: With the rise of smart personal devices, service-oriented human-agent interactions have become increasingly prevalent. This trend highlights the need for personalized dialogue assistants that can understand user-specific traits to accurately interpret requirements and tailor responses to individual preferences. However, existing approaches often overlook the complexities of long-term interactions and fail to capture users' subjective characteristics. To address these gaps, we present PAL-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the personalization capabilities of service-oriented assistants in long-term user-agent interactions. In the absence of available real-world data, we develop a multi-step LLM-based synthesis pipeline, which is further verified and refined by human annotators. This process yields PAL-Set, the first Chinese dataset comprising multi-session user logs and dialogue histories, which serves as the foundation for PAL-Bench. Furthermore, to improve personalized service-oriented interactions, we propose H$^2$Memory, a hierarchical and heterogeneous memory framework that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to improve personalized response generation. Comprehensive experiments on both our PAL-Bench and an external dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed memory framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对数函数的非线性翻译质量评估模型，解决了传统线性评分对短文本过度惩罚、对长文本惩罚不足的问题，使评估结果更符合人类感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的线性翻译质量评估方法在不同长度样本上存在偏差，短样本被过度惩罚，长样本被惩罚不足，与专家直觉不一致。需要开发更符合人类感知的评分模型。

Method: 基于多范围框架，提出双参数对数模型E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x)，通过参考容忍度和两个容忍点进行校准，使用一维根查找步骤确定参数。

Result: 实证数据显示可接受错误数量随样本大小呈对数增长而非线性增长。该模型提高了跨人类和AI生成翻译的可解释性、公平性和评分者间信度。

Conclusion: 该模型为翻译质量评估提供了更准确和可扩展的评估方法，为基于AI的文档级评估提供了更强基础，并与人类判断保持一致。

Abstract: Analytic Translation Quality Evaluation (TQE), based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), traditionally uses a linear error-to-penalty scale calibrated to a reference sample of 1000-2000 words. However, linear extrapolation biases judgment on samples of different sizes, over-penalizing short samples and under-penalizing long ones, producing misalignment with expert intuition.
  Building on the Multi-Range framework, this paper presents a calibrated, non-linear scoring model that better reflects how human content consumers perceive translation quality across samples of varying length. Empirical data from three large-scale enterprise environments shows that acceptable error counts grow logarithmically, not linearly, with sample size.
  Psychophysical and cognitive evidence, including the Weber-Fechner law and Cognitive Load Theory, supports this premise by explaining why the perceptual impact of additional errors diminishes while the cognitive burden grows with scale. We propose a two-parameter model
  E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x), a, b > 0,
  anchored to a reference tolerance and calibrated from two tolerance points using a one-dimensional root-finding step. The model yields an explicit interval within which the linear approximation stays within +/-20 percent relative error and integrates into existing evaluation workflows with only a dynamic tolerance function added.
  The approach improves interpretability, fairness, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations. By operationalizing a perceptually valid scoring paradigm, it advances translation quality evaluation toward more accurate and scalable assessment. The model also provides a stronger basis for AI-based document-level evaluation aligned with human judgment. Implementation considerations for CAT/LQA systems and implications for human and AI-generated text evaluation are discussed.

Abstract: Understanding sentiment in financial documents is crucial for gaining insights into market behavior. These reports often contain obfuscated language designed to present a positive or neutral outlook, even when underlying conditions may be less favorable. This paper presents a novel approach using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to decode obfuscated sentiment in Thai financial annual reports. We develop specific guidelines for annotating obfuscated sentiment in these texts and annotate more than one hundred financial reports. We then benchmark various text classification models on this annotated dataset, demonstrating strong performance in sentiment classification. Additionally, we conduct an event study to evaluate the real-world implications of our sentiment analysis on stock prices. Our results suggest that market reactions are selectively influenced by specific aspects within the reports. Our findings underscore the complexity of sentiment analysis in financial texts and highlight the importance of addressing obfuscated language to accurately assess market sentiment.

Conclusion: LLM辅助标注在可扩展叙事分析中具有潜力，同时指出了计算公民叙事研究的局限性和未来方向。

Abstract: Public Narratives (PNs) are key tools for leadership development and civic mobilization, yet their systematic analysis remains challenging due to their subjective interpretation and the high cost of expert annotation. In this work, we propose a novel computational framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the qualitative annotation of public narratives. Using a codebook we co-developed with subject-matter experts, we evaluate LLM performance against that of expert annotators. Our work reveals that LLMs can achieve near-human-expert performance, achieving an average F1 score of 0.80 across 8 narratives and 14 codes. We then extend our analysis to empirically explore how PN framework elements manifest across a larger dataset of 22 stories. Lastly, we extrapolate our analysis to a set of political speeches, establishing a novel lens in which to analyze political rhetoric in civic spaces. This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for scalable narrative analysis and highlights key limitations and directions for future research in computational civic storytelling.

Motivation: 高资源语言拥有丰富的ASR数据集，但匈牙利语等语言由于缺乏自发性对话语料库而代表性不足，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 从匈牙利语音语料库BEA的未处理部分构建了两个数据集：BEA-Large（255小时自发语音）和BEA-Dialogue（85小时自然对话），并使用公开可用的ASR模型建立基线。

Result: 微调后的Fast Conformer模型在自发语音上词错误率为14.18%，在重复语音上为4.8%；说话人日志错误率在13.05%-18.26%之间。

Conclusion: 对话ASR仍面临困难，特别是由于不流利、重叠和非正式语音模式。这些数据集和基线旨在推动匈牙利语音技术发展，并为其他语言提供方法论框架。

Abstract: The advancement of automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been largely enhanced by extensive datasets in high-resource languages, while languages such as Hungarian remain underrepresented due to limited spontaneous and conversational corpora. To address this gap, we introduce two new datasets -- BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue -- constructed from the previously unprocessed portions of the Hungarian speech corpus named BEA. BEA-Large extends BEA-Base with 255 hours of spontaneous speech from 433 speakers, enriched with detailed segment-level metadata. BEA-Dialogue, comprising 85 hours of spontaneous conversations, is a Hungarian speech corpus featuring natural dialogues partitioned into speaker-independent subsets, supporting research in conversational ASR and speaker diarization. We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18\% on spontaneous and 4.8\% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 13.05\% and 18.26\%, providing reference points for future improvements. The results highlight the persistent difficulty of conversational ASR, particularly due to disfluencies, overlaps, and informal speech patterns. By releasing these datasets and baselines, we aim to advance Hungarian speech technology and offer a methodological framework for developing spontaneous and conversational benchmarks in other languages.

Conclusion: 提出的分类法具有重要影响，不仅能全面分析数据集和LLM性能，还能指导LLM训练数据的构建。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL datasets are essential for training and evaluating text-to-SQL models, but existing datasets often suffer from limited coverage and fail to capture the diversity of real-world applications. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy for text-to-SQL classification based on dimensions including core intents, statement types, syntax structures, and key actions. Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks. Moreover, we uncover that existing LLMs typically fall short in adequately capturing the full range of scenarios, resulting in limited performance on SQL-Synth. However, fine-tuning can substantially improve their performance in these scenarios. The proposed taxonomy has significant potential impact, as it not only enables comprehensive analysis of datasets and the performance of different LLMs, but also guides the construction of training data for LLMs.

TL;DR: O-Mem是一个基于主动用户画像的新型记忆框架，通过动态提取和更新用户特征与事件记录，支持分层检索，在个性化响应方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在复杂环境中维持长期交互时面临上下文一致性和动态个性化挑战，传统基于语义分组的记忆系统会忽略语义无关但关键的用户信息并引入检索噪声。

Method: 提出O-Mem框架，基于主动用户画像动态提取和更新用户特征与事件记录，支持人物属性和主题相关上下文的分层检索。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准上达到51.76%（比SOTA提升近3%），在PERSONAMEM上达到62.99%（比SOTA提升3.5%），同时在token和交互响应时间效率上优于现有记忆框架。

Conclusion: O-Mem为开发高效且类人的个性化AI助手开辟了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-powered agents have demonstrated significant potential in generating human-like responses; however, they continue to face challenges in maintaining long-term interactions within complex environments, primarily due to limitations in contextual consistency and dynamic personalization. Existing memory systems often depend on semantic grouping prior to retrieval, which can overlook semantically irrelevant yet critical user information and introduce retrieval noise. In this report, we propose the initial design of O-Mem, a novel memory framework based on active user profiling that dynamically extracts and updates user characteristics and event records from their proactive interactions with agents. O-Mem supports hierarchical retrieval of persona attributes and topic-related context, enabling more adaptive and coherent personalized responses. O-Mem achieves 51.76% on the public LoCoMo benchmark, a nearly 3% improvement upon LangMem,the previous state-of-the-art, and it achieves 62.99% on PERSONAMEM, a 3.5% improvement upon A-Mem,the previous state-of-the-art. O-Mem also boosts token and interaction response time efficiency compared to previous memory frameworks. Our work opens up promising directions for developing efficient and human-like personalized AI assistants in the future.

*Jiaming Qu,Mengtian Guo,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型将机器学习检测到的欺骗性评论的词汇线索转化为人类可理解的语言现象，以帮助识别虚假评论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欺骗性评论误导消费者、损害企业利益并破坏在线市场信任。虽然机器学习分类器能有效区分欺骗性评论，但其学习到的特征往往难以被人类理解。

Method: 利用大型语言模型将机器学习分类器学习到的词汇线索翻译成人类可理解的语言现象，并与LLM先验知识和上下文学习获得的现象进行比较。

Result: 通过这种方法获得的语言现象具有实证基础，能在相似领域泛化，且比LLM先验知识或上下文学习获得的现象更具预测性。

Conclusion: 这些语言现象有助于人们在无法使用欺骗检测分类器的环境中批判性评估在线评论的可信度。

Abstract: Deceptive reviews mislead consumers, harm businesses, and undermine trust in online marketplaces. Machine learning classifiers can learn from large amounts of training examples to effectively distinguish deceptive reviews from genuine ones. However, the distinguishing features learned by these classifiers are often subtle, fragmented, and difficult for humans to interpret. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) to translate machine-learned lexical cues into human-understandable language phenomena that can differentiate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. We show that language phenomena obtained in this manner are empirically grounded in data, generalizable across similar domains, and more predictive than phenomena either in LLMs' prior knowledge or obtained through in-context learning. These language phenomena have the potential to aid people in critically assessing the credibility of online reviews in environments where deception detection classifiers are unavailable.

*Chengyu Huang,Zhengxin Zhang,Claire Cardie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAPO是一种历史感知策略优化方法，通过跟踪每个问题的历史状态来激励模型生成比之前更简洁的正确解决方案，在保持准确性的同时显著减少输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测试时扩展响应长度虽然能提升LLM的推理能力，但会导致冗长输出和增加推理成本。传统方法没有利用训练过程中相同问题的历史信息，限制了解决方案随时间推移变得更加简洁的能力。

Method: HAPO跟踪每个问题的历史状态（如之前生成正确响应的最小长度），基于历史状态设计新颖的长度奖励函数，激励发现比之前更简洁的正确解决方案。该方法结合长度奖励和正确性奖励，共同优化正确性和效率。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试上的实验结果显示，HAPO能有效诱导LLM的简洁推理能力，产生33-59%的长度缩减，而准确率仅下降2-5%。

Conclusion: HAPO通过利用历史信息成功实现了在保持高准确性的同时显著减少模型输出长度，为LLM的高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While scaling the length of responses at test-time has been shown to markedly improve the reasoning abilities and performance of large language models (LLMs), it often results in verbose outputs and increases inference cost. Prior approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span various difficulty levels. Experiment results demonstrate that HAPO effectively induces LLMs' concise reasoning abilities, producing length reductions of 33-59% with accuracy drops of only 2-5%.

*Sofia Jamil,Kotla Sai Charan,Sriparna Saha,Koustava Goswami,Joseph K J*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TAI框架，利用大语言模型和潜在扩散模型，通过翻译和图像生成增强印度诗歌的可访问性，支持联合国可持续发展目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度诗歌具有语言复杂性和文化深度，但现有研究大多忽视印度语言诗歌，其多层含义、文化典故和复杂语法结构给非母语读者带来理解挑战。

Method: 提出翻译与图像生成(TAI)框架，包括：(1)使用几率比偏好对齐算法的翻译模块，准确翻译形态丰富的诗歌；(2)使用语义图捕捉标记、依赖关系和隐喻语义关系的图像生成模块。

Result: 综合实验评估显示TAI Diffusion在诗歌图像生成任务中优于强基线模型，并创建了包含21种低资源印度语言的1,570首诗歌的MorphoVerse数据集。

Conclusion: 通过解决诗歌翻译和视觉理解的空白，这项工作旨在扩大可访问性并丰富读者的体验。

Abstract: Indian poetry, known for its linguistic complexity and deep cultural resonance, has a rich and varied heritage spanning thousands of years. However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DCRM指标来衡量偏好优化中响应对的质量，发现DCRM与学习效果正相关，并基于此提出了best-of-N²配对方法，能提升模型在多个基准测试上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究试图将偏好优化性能与偏好数据集关联，但观察到偏好响应对之间的差异可能不符合期望学习的目标差异。

Method: 使用距离和奖励边际来量化响应对差异，提出DCRM指标，并基于此开发best-of-N²配对方法来选择高质量训练数据。

Result: 实证表明，该方法在各种设置下都能在AlpacaEval、MT-Bench和Arena-Hard等基准上超越现有训练集的性能。

Conclusion: DCRM指标能有效衡量偏好优化数据质量，基于DCRM的数据选择方法能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent research has attempted to associate preference optimization (PO) performance with the underlying preference datasets. In this work, our observation is that the differences between the preferred response $y^+$ and dispreferred response $y^-$ influence what LLMs can learn, which may not match the desirable differences to learn. Therefore, we use distance and reward margin to quantify these differences, and combine them to get Distance Calibrated Reward Margin (DCRM), a metric that measures the quality of a response pair for PO. Intuitively, DCRM encourages minimal noisy differences and maximal desired differences. With this, we study 3 types of commonly used preference datasets, classified along two axes: the source of the responses and the preference labeling function. We establish a general correlation between higher DCRM of the training set and better learning outcome. Inspired by this, we propose a best-of-$N^2$ pairing method that selects response pairs with the highest DCRM. Empirically, in various settings, our method produces training datasets that can further improve models' performance on AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard over the existing training sets.

TL;DR: Lang1是一个专门为医疗运营决策设计的模型系列，通过在电子健康记录和互联网文本上进行预训练，在医疗任务上超越了比它大70倍的通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用基础模型缺乏医疗运营决策所需的专业知识，需要专门针对医疗领域进行训练。

Method: 开发了Lang1模型系列（100M-7B参数），在NYU Langone Health的800亿临床token和6270亿互联网token的混合语料上进行预训练，并使用ReMedE基准进行零样本和微调评估。

Result: 微调后的Lang1-1B在30天再入院预测、死亡率预测、住院时长、合并症编码和保险拒赔预测等任务上，AUROC分别提升了3.64%-6.75%和1.66%-23.66%，超越了比它大70倍的通用模型。

Conclusion: 医疗运营的预测能力需要明确的监督微调，而领域内预训练使这一过程更高效。专业LLM可以在专业任务上与通用模型竞争，有效的医疗AI需要领域内预训练、监督微调和真实世界评估的结合。

Abstract: Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服NLP任务中真实数据获取的挑战和隐私担忧，探索LLM生成数据在情感分析中的潜力。

Method: 使用定制提示创建负面新闻标题语料库，通过专家评审和嵌入空间分析验证合成数据，并与真实新闻标题进行多项基准测试比较。

Result: 生成的标题在内容、语调、长度和风格上与真实标题高度匹配，仅在POS分析中的专有名词得分存在明显差异。

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据在负面情感分析中具有作为真实数据替代品的潜力，能够有效支持NLP任务。

Abstract: This research examines the potential of datasets generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, aiming to overcome challenges related to data acquisition and privacy concerns associated with real-world data. Focusing on negative valence text, a critical component of sentiment analysis, we explore the use of LLM-generated synthetic news headlines as an alternative to real-world data. A specialized corpus of negative news headlines was created using tailored prompts to capture diverse negative sentiments across various societal domains. The synthetic headlines were validated by expert review and further analyzed in embedding space to assess their alignment with real-world negative news in terms of content, tone, length, and style. Key metrics such as correlation with real headlines, perplexity, coherence, and realism were evaluated. The synthetic dataset was benchmarked against two sets of real news headlines using evaluations including the Comparative Perplexity Test, Comparative Readability Test, Comparative POS Profiling, BERTScore, and Comparative Semantic Similarity. Results show the generated headlines match real headlines with the only marked divergence being in the proper noun score of the POS profile test.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型处理复杂专业知识的真实能力，特别是在气候变化这样的关键领域，需要建立可靠的多模态基准测试。

Method: 创建CLINB基准，包含真实用户问题和气候科学家制定的评估标准，采用基于模型的评估流程测试多个前沿模型。

Result: 前沿模型展现出卓越的知识综合能力，甚至超过专家辅助的混合答案，但在证据基础方面表现不佳，引用和图像存在高幻觉率。

Conclusion: 弥合知识综合与可验证归因之间的差距对于AI在科学工作流程中的部署至关重要，需要像CLINB这样的可靠基准来构建可信AI系统。

Abstract: Evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) handle complex, specialized knowledge remains a critical challenge. We address this through the lens of climate change by introducing CLINB, a benchmark that assesses models on open-ended, grounded, multimodal question answering tasks with clear requirements for knowledge quality and evidential support. CLINB relies on a dataset of real users' questions and evaluation rubrics curated by leading climate scientists. We implement and validate a model-based evaluation process and evaluate several frontier models. Our findings reveal a critical dichotomy. Frontier models demonstrate remarkable knowledge synthesis capabilities, often exhibiting PhD-level understanding and presentation quality. They outperform "hybrid" answers curated by domain experts assisted by weaker models. However, this performance is countered by failures in grounding. The quality of evidence varies, with substantial hallucination rates for references and images. We argue that bridging this gap between knowledge synthesis and verifiable attribution is essential for the deployment of AI in scientific workflows and that reliable, interpretable benchmarks like CLINB are needed to progress towards building trustworthy AI systems.

Conclusion: SynBullying为网络霸凌研究提供了一个可扩展、伦理安全的数据集，能够有效支持霸凌检测分类任务。

Abstract: We introduce SynBullying, a synthetic multi-LLM conversational dataset for studying and detecting cyberbullying (CB). SynBullying provides a scalable and ethically safe alternative to human data collection by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic bullying interactions. The dataset offers (i) conversational structure, capturing multi-turn exchanges rather than isolated posts; (ii) context-aware annotations, where harmfulness is assessed within the conversational flow considering context, intent, and discourse dynamics; and (iii) fine-grained labeling, covering various CB categories for detailed linguistic and behavioral analysis. We evaluate SynBullying across five dimensions, including conversational structure, lexical patterns, sentiment/toxicity, role dynamics, harm intensity, and CB-type distribution. We further examine its utility by testing its performance as standalone training data and as an augmentation source for CB classification.

### [388] [CausalGuard: A Smart System for Detecting and Preventing False Information in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11600)
*Piyushkumar Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalGuard是一种结合因果推理和符号逻辑的新方法，用于在发生过程中检测和预防大语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，会自信地陈述听起来合理但错误的信息，这成为在准确性要求高的场景中使用这些模型的主要障碍。现有解决方案要么需要重新训练整个模型，要么增加显著的计算成本，或者未能解决幻觉的根本原因。

Method: CausalGuard通过两条互补路径工作：一条追踪模型已知信息与生成内容之间的因果关系，另一条使用自动推理检查逻辑一致性。与仅检查生成后输出的先前方法不同，该系统理解导致错误陈述的因果链并在过程中早期干预。

Result: 在12个不同基准测试中，CausalGuard正确识别幻觉的概率为89.3%，仅遗漏8.3%的实际幻觉。更重要的是，它减少了近80%的错误声明，同时保持回答自然和有用。该系统在需要多步逻辑的复杂推理任务上表现尤其出色。

Conclusion: CausalGuard通过展示其推理过程，在医疗诊断或金融分析等敏感领域表现良好，因为这些领域理解决策原因与决策本身同等重要。

Abstract: While large language models have transformed how we interact with AI systems, they have a critical weakness: they confidently state false information that sounds entirely plausible. This "hallucination" problem has become a major barrier to using these models where accuracy matters most. Existing solutions either require retraining the entire model, add significant computational costs, or miss the root causes of why these hallucinations occur in the first place.
  We present CausalGuard, a new approach that combines causal reasoning with symbolic logic to catch and prevent hallucinations as they happen. Unlike previous methods that only check outputs after generation, our system understands the causal chain that leads to false statements and intervenes early in the process. CausalGuard works through two complementary paths: one that traces causal relationships between what the model knows and what it generates, and another that checks logical consistency using automated reasoning.
  Testing across twelve different benchmarks, we found that CausalGuard correctly identifies hallucinations 89.3\% of the time while missing only 8.3\% of actual hallucinations. More importantly, it reduces false claims by nearly 80\% while keeping responses natural and helpful. The system performs especially well on complex reasoning tasks where multiple steps of logic are required. Because CausalGuard shows its reasoning process, it works well in sensitive areas like medical diagnosis or financial analysis where understanding why a decision was made matters as much as the decision itself.

TL;DR: 提出了一个量化框架，通过将游戏建模为随机决策树，将技能和运气作为互补的控制源进行分离。定义了技能-运气指数S(G)在[-1,1]范围内，通过分解游戏结果为技能杠杆K和运气杠杆L。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种系统的方法来量化游戏中技能和运气的相对贡献，以便进行游戏设计、AI评估和风险分析等方面的应用。

Method: 将游戏建模为随机决策树，定义技能-运气指数S(G) = (K - L)/(K + L)，其中K是技能杠杆，L是运气杠杆。同时引入波动性Sigma来量化连续回合的结果不确定性。

Result: 分析了30个游戏，发现从纯运气（抛硬币，S=-1）到混合领域（如双陆棋，S=0）再到纯技能（国际象棋，S=+1）的连续谱。扑克表现出中等技能主导（S=0.33）。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到一般随机决策系统，能够对玩家影响力、游戏平衡性和预测稳定性进行原则性比较，在游戏设计、AI评估和风险评估中具有应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a quantitative framework for separating skill and chance in games by modeling them as complementary sources of control over stochastic decision trees. We define the Skill-Luck Index S(G) in [-1, 1] by decomposing game outcomes into skill leverage K and luck leverage L. Applying this to 30 games reveals a continuum from pure chance (coin toss, S = -1) through mixed domains such as backgammon (S = 0, Sigma = 1.20) to pure skill (chess, S = +1, Sigma = 0). Poker exhibits moderate skill dominance (S = 0.33) with K = 0.40 +/- 0.03 and Sigma = 0.80. We further introduce volatility Sigma to quantify outcome uncertainty over successive turns. The framework extends to general stochastic decision systems, enabling principled comparisons of player influence, game balance, and predictive stability, with applications to game design, AI evaluation, and risk assessment.

Motivation: 生成式视觉语言模型存在产生不安全、冒犯性或文化不当内容的风险，现有防御方法在保持生成质量和降低成本方面存在困难。

Method: 采用分层方法：多级NSFW检测器过滤词汇和语义风险；文化价值对齐模块识别社会规范、合法性和代表性伦理违规；意图消歧器检测隐含不安全含义。检测到不安全内容时，由大语言模型在动态角色特定指令下重写提示。

Result: 在对抗性、模糊性和价值敏感提示上的实验显示，VALOR将不安全输出减少高达100.00%，同时保持提示的有用性和创造性。

Conclusion: VALOR是可扩展且有效的方法，可在开放世界环境中部署安全、对齐且有用的图像生成系统。

Abstract: Generative vision-language models like Stable Diffusion demonstrate remarkable capabilities in creative media synthesis, but they also pose substantial risks of producing unsafe, offensive, or culturally inappropriate content when prompted adversarially. Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings.

Conclusion: AI-Mandel展示了能够生成和实施具体可行想法的AI物理学家原型。构建此类系统不仅能加速科学发展，还揭示了实现人类水平人工智能科学家所面临的具体挑战。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in numerous fields of science, yet the initial research questions and targets are still almost always provided by human researchers. AI-generated creative ideas in science are rare and often vague, so that it remains a human task to execute them. Automating idea generation and implementation in one coherent system would significantly shift the role of humans in the scientific process. Here we present AI-Mandel, an LLM agent that can generate and implement ideas in quantum physics. AI-Mandel formulates ideas from the literature and uses a domain-specific AI tool to turn them into concrete experiment designs that can readily be implemented in laboratories. The generated ideas by AI-Mandel are often scientifically interesting - for two of them we have already written independent scientific follow-up papers. The ideas include new variations of quantum teleportation, primitives of quantum networks in indefinite causal orders, and new concepts of geometric phases based on closed loops of quantum information transfer. AI-Mandel is a prototypical demonstration of an AI physicist that can generate and implement concrete, actionable ideas. Building such a system is not only useful to accelerate science, but it also reveals concrete open challenges on the path to human-level artificial scientists.

Conclusion: 该工作为通过交互教授智能体掌握形式化符号工具提供了通用蓝图，弥合了概率LLM与结构化知识图谱之间的差距。

Abstract: Generating complex, logically-sound SPARQL queries for multi-hop questions remains a critical bottleneck for Knowledge Graph Question Answering, as the brittle nature of one-shot generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) hinders reliable interaction with structured data. Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision. This work presents a generalizable blueprint for teaching agents to master formal, symbolic tools through interaction, bridging the gap between probabilistic LLMs and the structured world of Knowledge Graphs.

### [393] [On the Measure of a Model: From Intelligence to Generality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11773)
*Ruchira Dhar,Ninell Oldenburg,Anders Soegaard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张以通用性而非抽象智能概念作为AI评估的基础，认为智能基准测试与现实效用存在错位，通用性才是更稳定的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评估大语言模型的智能基准测试（如ARC、Raven测试等）缺乏稳定的智能定义，且无法预测实际任务表现，存在评估与现实效用错位的风险。

Method: 通过概念和形式分析，检验智能评估中常基于的三个假设：通用性、稳定性和现实性，证明只有通用性能够经受概念和实证检验。

Result: 分析表明智能并不能实现通用性，通用性应被理解为多任务学习问题，直接关联到可测量的性能广度和可靠性。

Conclusion: 应将AI进展评估重新定义为基于通用性的框架，通用性为评估不同任务能力提供了更稳定的基础。

Abstract: Benchmarks such as ARC, Raven-inspired tests, and the Blackbird Task are widely used to evaluate the intelligence of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the concept of intelligence remains elusive- lacking a stable definition and failing to predict performance on practical tasks such as question answering, summarization, or coding. Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks.

### [394] [Do LLMs Really Struggle at NL-FOL Translation? Revealing their Strengths via a Novel Benchmarking Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11816)
*Andrea Brunello,Luca Geatti,Michele Mignani,Angelo Montanari,Nicola Saccomanno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文批判性评估了现有NL-FOL翻译数据集和评估方法的局限性，提出了新的评估协议来区分真正的语义理解与表面模式识别，并发现对话导向的LLM在NL-FOL翻译方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于一阶逻辑(FOL)的表达能力和明确性，它是表示自然语言概念的强大形式化工具。然而，将自然语言转换为FOL(NL-FOL翻译)一直是一个长期挑战，尽管LLM的出现带来了突破希望，但现有文献对其能力提供了矛盾的结果。

Method: 1) 批判性检查现有NL-FOL翻译评估数据集和协议；2) 提出新的评估协议，专门设计用于区分真正的语义级逻辑理解与表面模式识别、记忆和数据集污染；3) 使用新方法评估不同LLM的性能。

Result: 研究表明，最先进的对话导向LLM展现出强大的NL-FOL翻译技能和真正的句子级逻辑理解能力，而嵌入中心模型表现明显较差。

Conclusion: 通过新的评估协议，证实了对话导向LLM在NL-FOL翻译任务中具有真正的语义理解能力，这为逻辑推理任务的评估提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Due to its expressiveness and unambiguous nature, First-Order Logic (FOL) is a powerful formalism for representing concepts expressed in natural language (NL). This is useful, e.g., for specifying and verifying desired system properties. While translating FOL into human-readable English is relatively straightforward, the inverse problem, converting NL to FOL (NL-FOL translation), has remained a longstanding challenge, for both humans and machines. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a breakthrough, recent literature provides contrasting results on their ability to perform NL-FOL translation. In this work, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we critically examine existing datasets and protocols for evaluating NL-FOL translation performance, revealing key limitations that may cause a misrepresentation of LLMs' actual capabilities. Second, to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation protocol explicitly designed to distinguish genuine semantic-level logical understanding from superficial pattern recognition, memorization, and dataset contamination. Third, using this new approach, we show that state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills and a genuine grasp of sentence-level logic, whereas embedding-centric models perform markedly worse.

### [395] [TopoPerception: A Shortcut-Free Evaluation of Global Visual Perception in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11831)
*Wenhao Zhou,Hao Zheng,Rong Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TopoPerception是一个基于拓扑属性的基准测试，用于严格评估大型视觉语言模型的全局视觉感知能力，发现当前模型在全局感知方面表现不佳，甚至不如随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估基准存在局部捷径，可能高估模型的感知能力。需要一种无捷径的方法来评估LVLMs的全局视觉感知能力。

Method: 利用拓扑属性构建评估基准，因为拓扑依赖于图像的全局结构且对局部特征不变，能够实现无捷径的全局感知评估。

Result: 所有最先进模型在TopoPerception上表现不佳，即使在最粗粒度感知下也不优于随机猜测。更强大的模型反而准确率更低。

Conclusion: 仅扩大模型规模不足以解决全局感知缺陷，可能需要新的训练范式或架构。TopoPerception揭示了当前LVLMs的关键瓶颈并提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically align visual features from an encoder with a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception. The data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Wenhao-Zhou/TopoPerception.

TL;DR: F2O是一个端到端系统，可将组织解剖视频转换为手势序列，并发现与术后结果相关的模式。该系统使用基于Transformer的时空建模和逐帧分类，在机器人辅助根治性前列腺切除术中准确检测连续短手势，并能预测术后结果，准确率与人工标注相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术中精细行为分析及其对患者结果的影响是一个长期挑战。需要开发能够自动分析手术视频并发现与术后结果相关模式的系统。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的空间和时间建模，结合逐帧分类方法，在机器人辅助根治性前列腺切除术的神经保留步骤中检测连续短手势（约2秒）。从手势频率、持续时间和转换中提取特征。

Result: F2O在手势检测方面表现优异（AUC：帧级0.80；视频级0.81）。基于F2O的特征预测术后结果的准确率与人工标注相当（0.79 vs. 0.75）。系统成功捕捉到与勃起功能恢复相关的关键模式，如延长组织剥离和减少能量使用。

Conclusion: F2O通过实现自动可解释的评估，为数据驱动的手术反馈和前瞻性临床决策支持奠定了基础。

Abstract: Fine-grained analysis of intraoperative behavior and its impact on patient outcomes remain a longstanding challenge. We present Frame-to-Outcome (F2O), an end-to-end system that translates tissue dissection videos into gesture sequences and uncovers patterns associated with postoperative outcomes. Leveraging transformer-based spatial and temporal modeling and frame-wise classification, F2O robustly detects consecutive short (~2 seconds) gestures in the nerve-sparing step of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (AUC: 0.80 frame-level; 0.81 video-level). F2O-derived features (gesture frequency, duration, and transitions) predicted postoperative outcomes with accuracy comparable to human annotations (0.79 vs. 0.75; overlapping 95% CI). Across 25 shared features, effect size directions were concordant with small differences (~ 0.07), and strong correlation (r = 0.96, p < 1e-14). F2O also captured key patterns linked to erectile function recovery, including prolonged tissue peeling and reduced energy use. By enabling automatic interpretable assessment, F2O establishes a foundation for data-driven surgical feedback and prospective clinical decision support.

TL;DR: Forgetting-MarI是一个LLM遗忘框架，通过惩罚边际信息来选择性移除特定数据的影响，同时保留其他数据的信息，提供可证明的不可检测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型在不断扩大数据集上训练，需要从训练模型中移除特定数据影响以实现隐私保护和法规遵从。现有遗忘方法往往在尝试'忘记'特定数据时移除过多信息，导致模型性能下降。

Method: 引入Forgetting-MarI框架，通过惩罚边际信息来仅移除待遗忘数据贡献的额外信息，同时保留待保留数据支持的信息，提供明确的遗忘数据集残留影响上界。

Result: 广泛实验证实该方法优于当前最先进的遗忘方法，在多种基准测试中实现可靠的遗忘和更好的通用模型性能保留。

Conclusion: 这一进展代表了使AI系统更可控、符合隐私和版权法规而不影响其有效性的重要一步。

Abstract: As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了四种大语言模型在抽象视觉推理问题上的表现，使用四种推理架构在RAVEN-FAIR数据集上进行测试，发现GPT-4.1-Mini表现最佳，推理效果具有模型特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统评估大语言模型在抽象视觉推理问题上的性能表现，探索不同推理架构对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用四种LLM模型（GPT-4.1-Mini、Claude-3.5-Haiku、Gemini-1.5-Flash、Llama-3.3-70b）和四种推理架构（单次推理、嵌入控制重复、自我反思、多智能体），通过三阶段过程生成视觉响应，使用SSIM和LPIPS指标评估，分析思维链分数和错误类型。

Result: GPT-4.1-Mini在所有架构中始终获得最高准确率，多智能体架构偶尔改变语义和数值平衡但效果不一致，每个模型对架构设计表现出不同的敏感模式，响应覆盖率变化是跨架构比较的混淆因素。

Conclusion: 推理有效性具有模型特异性，多轮评估策略比单轮评估更可靠，最佳配置的上限性能通过五次独立运行的最佳结果来估计。

Abstract: This study aims to systematically evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in abstract visual reasoning problems. We examined four LLM models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) utilizing four different reasoning architectures (single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent) on the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability. While the multi-agent architecture occasionally altered semantic and numeric balance across models, these effects were not uniformly beneficial. Instead, each model exhibited distinct sensitivity patterns to architectural design, underscoring that reasoning effectiveness remains model-specific. Variations in response coverage further emerged as a confounding factor that complicates direct cross-architecture comparison. To estimate the upper-bound performance of each configuration, we report the best of five independent runs, representing a best-case scenario rather than an averaged outcome. This multi-run strategy aligns with recent recommendations, which emphasize that single-run evaluations are fragile and may lead to unreliable conclusions.

Abstract: This paper introduces the ``rebound Winner-Take-All (RWTA)" motif as the basic element of a scalable neuromorphic control architecture. From the cellular level to the system level, the resulting architecture combines the reliability of discrete computation and the tunability of continuous regulation: it inherits the discrete computation capabilities of winner-take-all state machines and the continuous tuning capabilities of excitable biophysical circuits. The proposed event-based framework addresses continuous rhythmic generation and discrete decision-making in a unified physical modeling language. We illustrate the versatility, robustness, and modularity of the architecture through the nervous system design of a snake robot.

Conclusion: CFA-SMOTE方法能有效解决气候变化预测中的类别不平衡问题，提高对气候异常事件的预测能力，为应对气候变化提供更好的AI解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, humanity has begun to experience the catastrophic effects of climate change as economic sectors (such as agriculture) struggle with unpredictable and extreme weather events. Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of "climate outlier events". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios). The focal climate-change domain used relies on predicting grass growth on Irish dairy farms, during Europe-wide drought and forage crisis of 2018.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合神经符号框架，通过结合大型语言模型和符号逻辑，实现了复杂法律中法定不一致性的确定性检测。以美国国内税收法典为案例研究，展示了该框架在检测不一致条款方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在税务领域的应用较少，且在处理层次化处理和深度结构化推理方面存在困难，特别是在长文本上。本研究旨在解决这些局限性，提供更可靠的法定不一致性检测方案。

Method: 使用GPT-4o将税法条款翻译为Prolog规则，在SWISH中精炼，然后通过Prolog增强提示测试不一致性检测效果。同时开发了混合Prolog模型，利用GPT-5进行规则精炼。

Result: GPT-4o单独使用时仅在一个策略中检测到不一致性（33%准确率）。而混合Prolog模型产生了确定性和可重现的结果，成功检测到不一致区域，验证测试确认其准确、内部一致且能自主识别不一致性。

Conclusion: 基于符号逻辑的LLM辅助形式化方法能够实现透明可靠的法定不一致性检测，为复杂法律分析提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that achieves deterministic detection of statutory inconsistency in complex law. We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as a case study because its complexity makes it a fertile domain for identifying conflicts. Our research offers a solution for detecting inconsistent provisions by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic logic.
  LLM-based methods can support compliance, fairness, and statutory drafting, yet tax-specific applications remain sparse. A key challenge is that such models struggle with hierarchical processing and deep structured reasoning, especially over long text.
  This research addresses these gaps through experiments using GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Prolog. GPT-4o was first used to translate Section 121 into Prolog rules and refine them in SWISH. These rules were then incorporated into prompts to test whether Prolog-augmented prompting improved GPT-4o's inconsistency detection. GPT-4o, whether prompted with natural language alone or with Prolog augmentation, detected the inconsistency in only one of three strategies (33 percent accuracy), but its reasoning quality differed: natural-language prompting achieved 100 percent rule coverage, while Prolog-augmented prompting achieved 66 percent, indicating more incomplete statutory analysis.
  In contrast to probabilistic prompting, the hybrid Prolog model produced deterministic and reproducible results. Guided by GPT-5 for refinement, the model formalized the IRC section's competing interpretations and successfully detected an inconsistency zone. Validation tests confirm that the Prolog implementation is accurate, internally consistent, deterministic, and capable of autonomously identifying inconsistencies. These findings show that LLM-assisted formalization, anchored in symbolic logic, enables transparent and reliable statutory inconsistency detection.

Conclusion: DDR框架通过高效的依赖检索机制有效提升了自动形式化的性能，为深度学习与形式数学的融合提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: The convergence of deep learning and formal mathematics has spurred research in formal verification. Statement autoformalization, a crucial first step in this process, aims to translate informal descriptions into machine-verifiable representations but remains a significant challenge. The core difficulty lies in the fact that existing methods often suffer from a lack of contextual awareness, leading to hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. Furthermore, current retrieval-augmented approaches exhibit poor precision and recall for formal library dependency retrieval, and lack the scalability to effectively leverage ever-growing public datasets. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented framework based on DDR (\textit{Direct Dependency Retrieval}) for statement autoformalization. Our DDR method directly generates candidate library dependencies from natural language mathematical descriptions and subsequently verifies their existence within the formal library via an efficient suffix array check. Leveraging this efficient search mechanism, we constructed a dependency retrieval dataset of over 500,000 samples and fine-tuned a high-precision DDR model. Experimental results demonstrate that our DDR model significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both retrieval precision and recall. Consequently, an autoformalizer equipped with DDR shows consistent performance advantages in both single-attempt accuracy and multi-attempt stability compared to models using traditional selection-based RAG methods.

Conclusion: CoE和LAT框架有效提升了视觉文档检索增强生成的可验证性和可靠性，为多模态问答提供了可追溯的证据归因机制。

Abstract: Aiming to identify precise evidence sources from visual documents, visual evidence attribution for visual document retrieval-augmented generation (VD-RAG) ensures reliable and verifiable predictions from vision-language models (VLMs) in multimodal question answering. Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5. Meanwhile, LAT not only outperforms the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which is trained to directly produce answers with attribution, but also exhibits stronger generalization across domains.

Abstract: AI tools in pathology have improved screening throughput, standardized quantification, and revealed prognostic patterns that inform treatment. However, adoption remains limited because most systems still lack the human-readable reasoning needed to audit decisions and prevent errors. We present RECAP-PATH, an interpretable framework that establishes a self-learning paradigm, shifting off-the-shelf multimodal large language models from passive pattern recognition to evidence-linked diagnostic reasoning. At its core is a two-phase learning process that autonomously derives diagnostic criteria: diversification expands pathology-style explanations, while optimization refines them for accuracy. This self-learning approach requires only small labeled sets and no white-box access or weight updates to generate cancer diagnoses. Evaluated on breast and prostate datasets, RECAP-PATH produced rationales aligned with expert assessment and delivered substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy over baselines. By uniting visual understanding with reasoning, RECAP-PATH provides clinically trustworthy AI and demonstrates a generalizable path toward evidence-linked interpretation.

Abstract: The advent of smart manufacturing is addressing the limitations of traditional centralized scheduling and inflexible production line configurations in the rubber tyre industry, especially in terms of coping with dynamic production demands. Contemporary tyre manufacturing systems form complex networks of tightly coupled subsystems pronounced nonlinear interactions and emergent dynamics. This complexity renders the effective coordination of multiple subsystems, posing an essential yet formidable task. For high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problems in this domain, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization (MPD-PPO). This algorithm employs a multi-branch policy architecture with differentiated gradient clipping constraints to ensure stable and efficient high-dimensional policy updates. Validated through experiments on width and thickness control in rubber tyre film production, MPD-PPO demonstrates substantial improvements in both tuning accuracy and operational efficiency. The framework successfully tackles key challenges, including high dimensionality, multi-objective trade-offs, and dynamic adaptation, thus delivering enhanced performance and production stability for real-time industrial deployment in tyre manufacturing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了T-BoN BO框架，将贝叶斯优化扩展到语言领域，通过结合Best-of-N选择和文本梯度来优化评估效率，在广告对齐任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自改进AI主要关注生成效率，但在许多社会应用中，评估解决方案比生成更昂贵耗时。需要优化评估效率而非查询效率。

Method: 提出T-BoN BO框架，证明Best-of-N选择策略和文本梯度在统计上模拟UCB获取函数的梯度行为，实现语言空间贝叶斯优化。

Result: 在自动化广告对齐任务中，T-BoN BO相比现有最优基线表现出更优越的性能。

Conclusion: T-BoN BO为AI自改进提供了一种简单且评估效率高的语言空间贝叶斯优化框架，解决了直接估计获取函数的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled self-improving AI, i.e., AI that iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines its own outcomes. Recent studies have shown that self-improving AI focusing on prompt optimization can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuned LLMs. Here, their `performance' is typically measured by query efficiency - the number of LLM-generated solution samples required to meet a certain performance threshold. However, in many societal applications, the primary limitation is not generating new solutions but evaluating them. For instance, evaluating an ad's effectiveness requires significant human feedback, which is far more costly and time-consuming than generating a candidate ad. To optimize for the evaluation efficiency objective, a natural approach is to extend Bayesian Optimization (BO), a framework proven optimal for evaluation efficiency, to the language domain. However, the difficulty of directly estimating suitable acquisition functions in LLMs' minds makes this extension challenging. This paper overcomes this challenge by proving that the combination of the simple and widely used Best-of-N selection strategy and simple textual gradients (i.e., textual edits from a critic model) statistically emulates the behavior of the gradients on the canonical UCB acquisition function, which induces optimal exploration in terms of evaluation efficiency. Based on this result, we propose TextGrad-Best-of-N Bayesian Optimization (T-BoN BO), a simple and eval-efficient language-space Bayesian optimization framework for AI self-improvement. We also empirically validate T-BoN BO by applying it to automated ad alignment tasks for persona distribution, demonstrating its superior performance compared to popular state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Embedding CFR算法，通过将信息集嵌入到低维连续空间来解决大规模不完全信息扩展式博弈，相比基于聚类的抽象方法能更精确地捕捉信息集间的差异和联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练离散聚类的抽象方法在硬分类过程中会不可逆地丢失信息集之间的量化细微差异，这些差异对于策略求解至关重要，从而影响求解质量。

Method: 受自然语言处理中词嵌入范式启发，提出Embedding CFR算法：预训练并将孤立信息集的特征嵌入到相互连接的低维连续空间，在该嵌入空间中进行后悔累积和策略更新的策略求解过程。

Result: 在扑克游戏实验中，在相同空间开销下，Embedding CFR相比基于聚类的抽象算法实现了显著更快的可被利用性收敛，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 这是扑克AI中首个通过低维嵌入预训练信息集抽象来进行策略求解的算法，能够更精确地捕捉信息集间的差异和联系，提升求解质量。

Abstract: High-quality information set abstraction remains a core challenge in solving large-scale imperfect-information extensive-form games (IIEFGs)-such as no-limit Texas Hold'em-where the finite nature of spatial resources hinders strategy solving over the full game. State-of-the-art AI methods rely on pre-trained discrete clustering for abstraction, yet their hard classification irreversibly loses critical information: specifically, the quantifiable subtle differences between information sets-vital for strategy solving-thereby compromising the quality of such solving. Inspired by the word embedding paradigm in natural language processing, this paper proposes the Embedding CFR algorithm, a novel approach for solving strategies in IIEFGs within an embedding space. The algorithm pre-trains and embeds features of isolated information sets into an interconnected low-dimensional continuous space, where the resulting vectors more precisely capture both the distinctions and connections between information sets. Embedding CFR presents a strategy-solving process driven by regret accumulation and strategy updates within this embedding space, with accompanying theoretical analysis verifying its capacity to reduce cumulative regret. Experiments on poker show that with the same spatial overhead, Embedding CFR achieves significantly faster exploitability convergence compared to cluster-based abstraction algorithms, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first algorithm in poker AI that pre-trains information set abstractions through low-dimensional embedding for strategy solving.

Motivation: 解决大规模不完全信息游戏中因极端不完美回忆抽象导致的历史信息完全丢失问题，这种过度抽象严重损害了AI的游戏表现。

Method: 引入k-recall winrate特征，利用历史和未来游戏信息区分信号观察信息集；开发KrwEmd算法，使用earth mover's distance测量特征差异来聚类信号观察信息集。

Result: 实验结果表明，KrwEmd相比现有算法显著提升了AI的游戏性能。

Conclusion: KrwEmd是首个实用的解决过度抽象问题的算法，通过有效利用历史信息改善了不完全信息游戏的AI性能。

Abstract: Excessive abstraction is a critical challenge in hand abstraction-a task specific to games like Texas hold'em-when solving large-scale imperfect-information games, as it impairs AI performance. This issue arises from extreme implementations of imperfect-recall abstraction, which entirely discard historical information. This paper presents KrwEmd, the first practical algorithm designed to address this problem. We first introduce the k-recall winrate feature, which not only qualitatively distinguishes signal observation infosets by leveraging both future and, crucially, historical game information, but also quantitatively captures their similarity. We then develop the KrwEmd algorithm, which clusters signal observation infosets using earth mover's distance to measure discrepancies between their features. Experimental results demonstrate that KrwEmd significantly improves AI gameplay performance compared to existing algorithms.

Motivation: 现有数据集和微调方法在8B以下小模型中会导致灾难性遗忘，主要问题是忽视训练数据知识与模型固有能力的关系，以及传统训练目标无法有效约束固有知识保留。

Method: 1) 数据侧：构建包含元认知知识的5K多任务推理数据集，基于任务知识和模型技能过滤数据；2) 训练侧：提出GDPO方法，通过参考模型隐式约束优化路径，更适合资源受限场景。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法显著缓解了灾难性遗忘，提升了小模型的推理性能。

Conclusion: 提出的数据构建和GDPO训练方法有效解决了小模型知识蒸馏中的灾难性遗忘问题，实现了更好的知识迁移和性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, which can be effectively compressed into smaller models. However, existing datasets and fine-tuning approaches still face challenges that lead to catastrophic forgetting, particularly for models smaller than 8B. First, most datasets typically ignore the relationship between training data knowledge and the model's inherent abilities, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. Second, conventional training objectives often fail to constrain inherent knowledge preservation, which can result in forgetting of previously learned skills. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive solution that alleviates catastrophic forgetting from both the data and fine-tuning approach perspectives. On the data side, we construct a dataset of 5K instances that covers multiple reasoning tasks and incorporates metacognitive knowledge, making it more tolerant and effective for distillation into smaller models. We annotate the metacognitive knowledge required to solve each question and filter the data based on task knowledge and the model's inherent skills. On the training side, we introduce GDPO (Group Direction Preference Optimization), which is better suited for resource-limited scenarios and can efficiently approximate the performance of GRPO. Guided by the large model and by implicitly constraining the optimization path through a reference model, GDPO enables more effective knowledge transfer from the large model and constrains excessive parameter drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting and improves reasoning performance on smaller models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分子序列表示与文本描述对齐方法存在三个关键问题：传统指标优先考虑语言流畅性而非化学准确性；训练数据常包含化学模糊描述；独立优化生成方向导致双向不一致。

Method: 提出RTMol框架，通过自监督往返学习统一分子描述和文本到SMILES生成，引入新颖的往返评估指标，支持无需配对分子-文本语料库的无监督训练。

Result: 实验表明RTMol在各种LLMs上将双向对齐性能提升高达47%，为联合分子-文本理解和生成建立了有效范式。

Conclusion: RTMol通过双向对齐框架有效解决了分子序列表示与文本描述对齐的关键挑战，显著提升了双向一致性性能。

Abstract: Aligning molecular sequence representations (e.g., SMILES notations) with textual descriptions is critical for applications spanning drug discovery, materials design, and automated chemical literature analysis. Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DatalogMTL推理方法虽然提供正确性和完整性，但缺乏对高效动态更新的支持，而现实应用需要频繁的数据更新

Method: 基于经典DRed算法构建，专门设计操作符来处理DatalogMTL物化结果的周期性表示，支持增量更新

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验结果显示，DRedMTL通常显著优于完全重计算方法，有时性能提升达数量级

Conclusion: DRedMTL算法有效解决了DatalogMTL中动态更新的效率问题，为实时应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: DatalogMTL extends the classical Datalog language with metric temporal logic (MTL), enabling expressive reasoning over temporal data. While existing reasoning approaches, such as materialisation based and automata based methods, offer soundness and completeness, they lack support for handling efficient dynamic updates, a crucial requirement for real-world applications that involve frequent data updates. In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program. Unlike a Datalog materialisation which is in essence a finite set of facts, a DatalogMTL materialisation has to be represented as a finite set of facts plus periodic intervals indicating how the full materialisation can be constructed through unfolding. To cope with this, our algorithm is equipped with specifically designed operators to efficiently handle such periodic representations of DatalogMTL materialisations. We have implemented this approach and tested it on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that DRedMTL often significantly outperforms rematerialisation, sometimes by orders of magnitude.

Motivation: 现实世界知识图谱通常不完整，现有方法无法自适应地融合多源知识，无法充分利用知识的互补性。

Result: 实验表明DoM在多个基准测试中一致优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DoM框架通过动态知识融合有效解决了不完整知识图谱问答问题，构建的新数据集提供了更真实的评估基准。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to improve factual accuracy by leveraging structured knowledge. However, real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, leading to the problem of Incomplete KGQA (IKGQA). A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark. Through extensive experiments, we show that DoM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ViTE通过虚拟图和专家路由的组合，实现了灵活可扩展的交互建模，在行人轨迹预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for ensuring safety in autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and urban planning applications. While early approaches primarily focus on one-hop pairwise relationships, recent studies attempt to capture high-order interactions by stacking multiple Graph Neural Network (GNN) layers. However, these approaches face a fundamental trade-off: insufficient layers may lead to under-reaching problems that limit the model's receptive field, while excessive depth can result in prohibitive computational costs. We argue that an effective model should be capable of adaptively modeling both explicit one-hop interactions and implicit high-order dependencies, rather than relying solely on architectural depth. To this end, we propose ViTE (Virtual graph Trajectory Expert router), a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. ViTE consists of two key modules: a Virtual Graph that introduces dynamic virtual nodes to model long-range and high-order interactions without deep GNN stacks, and an Expert Router that adaptively selects interaction experts based on social context using a Mixture-of-Experts design. This combination enables flexible and scalable reasoning across varying interaction patterns. Experiments on three benchmarks (ETH/UCY, NBA, and SDD) demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating both its effectiveness and practical efficiency.

Result: 这些案例代表了特定的理解观点而非普遍定义，但有助于探索世界模型的局限性

Conclusion: 世界模型框架在充分表征人类水平理解方面存在局限性

Abstract: World models have garnered substantial interest in the AI community. These are internal representations that simulate aspects of the external world, track entities and states, capture causal relationships, and enable prediction of consequences. This contrasts with representations based solely on statistical correlations. A key motivation behind this research direction is that humans possess such mental world models, and finding evidence of similar representations in AI models might indicate that these models "understand" the world in a human-like way. In this paper, we use case studies from the philosophy of science literature to critically examine whether the world model framework adequately characterizes human-level understanding. We focus on specific philosophical analyses where the distinction between world model capabilities and human understanding is most pronounced. While these represent particular views of understanding rather than universal definitions, they help us explore the limits of world models.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了开发隐私保护、可复现的患者安全监测系统的新途径，具有在ICU部署的潜力。

Abstract: Unplanned extubation (UE) remains a critical patient safety concern in intensive care units (ICUs), often leading to severe complications or death. Real-time UE detection has been limited, largely due to the ethical and privacy challenges of obtaining annotated ICU video data. We propose Augmented Unplanned Removal Alert (AURA), a vision-based risk detection system developed and validated entirely on a fully synthetic video dataset. By leveraging text-to-video diffusion, we generated diverse and clinically realistic ICU scenarios capturing a range of patient behaviors and care contexts. The system applies pose estimation to identify two high-risk movement patterns: collision, defined as hand entry into spatial zones near airway tubes, and agitation, quantified by the velocity of tracked anatomical keypoints. Expert assessments confirmed the realism of the synthetic data, and performance evaluations showed high accuracy for collision detection and moderate performance for agitation recognition. This work demonstrates a novel pathway for developing privacy-preserving, reproducible patient safety monitoring systems with potential for deployment in intensive care settings.

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文感知、可靠的多代理移动自动化建立了稳健范式，通过双层次检索增强有效解决了移动代理的关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Mobile agents show immense potential, yet current state-of-the-art (SoTA) agents exhibit inadequate success rates on real-world, long-horizon, cross-application tasks. We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型对人类道德决策的影响日益增加，但现有方法主要关注评估而非主动引导其道德决策。需要解决LLM在超出训练分布场景中的道德对齐问题。

Method: 构建了包含680个人工标注的高模糊度道德场景的Moral-Reason-QA数据集，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization学习框架，通过复合奖励同时优化决策对齐和框架特定的推理过程。

Result: 在未见过的道德场景中成功实现了泛化，功利主义框架的softmax归一化对齐分数提高了+0.757，义务论框架提高了+0.450。

Conclusion: LLM代理可以被系统训练以内化和应用特定道德框架到新情境中，为AI安全提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly influencing human moral decisions, yet current approaches focus primarily on evaluating rather than actively steering their moral decisions. We formulate this as an out-of-distribution moral alignment problem, where LLM agents must learn to apply consistent moral reasoning frameworks to scenarios beyond their training distribution. We introduce Moral-Reason-QA, a novel dataset extending 680 human-annotated, high-ambiguity moral scenarios with framework-specific reasoning traces across utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics, enabling systematic evaluation of moral generalization in realistic decision contexts. Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets. The experiments also reveal training challenges and promising directions that inform future research. These findings establish that LLM agents can be systematically trained to internalize and apply specific moral frameworks to novel situations, providing a critical foundation for AI safety as language models become more integrated into human decision-making processes.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly undertake digital work, reliable frameworks are needed to evaluate their real-world competence, adaptability, and capacity for human collaboration. Existing benchmarks remain largely static, synthetic, or domain-limited, providing limited insight into how agents perform in dynamic, economically meaningful environments. We introduce UpBench, a dynamically evolving benchmark grounded in real jobs drawn from the global Upwork labor marketplace. Each task corresponds to a verified client transaction, anchoring evaluation in genuine work activity and financial outcomes. UpBench employs a rubric-based evaluation framework, in which expert freelancers decompose each job into detailed, verifiable acceptance criteria and assess AI submissions with per-criterion feedback. This structure enables fine-grained analysis of model strengths, weaknesses, and instruction-following fidelity beyond binary pass/fail metrics. Human expertise is integrated throughout the data pipeline (from job curation and rubric construction to evaluation) ensuring fidelity to real professional standards and supporting research on human-AI collaboration. By regularly refreshing tasks to reflect the evolving nature of online work, UpBench provides a scalable, human-centered foundation for evaluating agentic systems in authentic labor-market contexts, offering a path toward a collaborative framework, where AI amplifies human capability through partnership rather than replacement.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly improved the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite these successes, existing methods mainly focus on single-domain RL (e.g., mathematics) with verifiable rewards (RLVR), and their reliance on purely online RL frameworks restricts the exploration space, thereby limiting reasoning performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by leveraging rubrics to provide both fine-grained reward signals and offline guidance. We propose $\textbf{RGR-GRPO}$ (Reward and Guidance through Rubrics), a rubric-driven RL framework for multi-domain reasoning. RGR-GRPO enables LLMs to receive dense and informative rewards while exploring a larger solution space during GRPO training. Extensive experiments across 14 benchmarks spanning multiple domains demonstrate that RGR-GRPO consistently outperforms RL methods that rely solely on alternative reward schemes or offline guidance. Compared with verifiable online RL baseline, RGR-GRPO achieves average improvements of +7.0%, +5.4%, +8.4%, and +6.6% on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and general reasoning tasks, respectively. Notably, RGR-GRPO maintains stable entropy fluctuations during off-policy training and achieves superior pass@k performance, reflecting sustained exploration and effective breakthrough beyond existing performance bottlenecks.

Motivation: 尽管AI技术快速发展，但预测和理解用户或人类合作者的次优行为仍然是一个关键挑战。这些行为通常不是非理性的，而是在认知限制和偏见信念下的理性决策。

Method: 提出计算理性用户模型，显式建模有限记忆过程如何导致动态不一致的偏见信念状态和次优决策。开发基于嵌套粒子滤波的在线推理方法，同时跟踪用户潜在信念状态并估计未知认知限制。

Abstract: Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations.

Abstract: Autonomous agents operating in sequential decision-making tasks under uncertainty can benefit from external action suggestions, which provide valuable guidance but inherently vary in reliability. Existing methods for incorporating such advice typically assume static and known suggester quality parameters, limiting practical deployment. We introduce a framework that dynamically learns and adapts to varying suggester reliability in partially observable environments. First, we integrate suggester quality directly into the agent's belief representation, enabling agents to infer and adjust their reliance on suggestions through Bayesian inference over suggester types. Second, we introduce an explicit ``ask'' action allowing agents to strategically request suggestions at critical moments, balancing informational gains against acquisition costs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates robust performance across varying suggester qualities, adaptation to changing reliability, and strategic management of suggestion requests. This work provides a foundation for adaptive human-agent collaboration by addressing suggestion uncertainty in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Online health resources and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as a first point of contact for medical decision-making, yet their reliability in healthcare remains limited by low accuracy, lack of transparency, and susceptibility to unverified information. We introduce a proof-of-concept conversational self-triage system that guides LLMs with 100 clinically validated flowcharts from the American Medical Association, providing a structured and auditable framework for patient decision support. The system leverages a multi-agent framework consisting of a retrieval agent, a decision agent, and a chat agent to identify the most relevant flowchart, interpret patient responses, and deliver personalized, patient-friendly recommendations, respectively. Performance was evaluated at scale using synthetic datasets of simulated conversations. The system achieved 95.29% top-3 accuracy in flowchart retrieval (N=2,000) and 99.10% accuracy in flowchart navigation across varied conversational styles and conditions (N=37,200). By combining the flexibility of free-text interaction with the rigor of standardized clinical protocols, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of transparent, accurate, and generalizable AI-assisted self-triage, with potential to support informed patient decision-making while improving healthcare resource utilization.

Motivation: 当前LLMs生成的推理内容通常是非结构化和非正式的，难以判断模型是否真正理解科学推理的基本范式。

Method: 引入潜在推理链提取(ARCHE)任务，要求模型将复杂推理分解为推理逻辑树(RLT)，其中所有推理步骤都明确归类为演绎、归纳或溯因三种基本推理模式。

Result: 在10个领先LLMs上的评估显示，模型在推理边准确性和实体覆盖率之间存在权衡，且没有一个模型能够提取完整且标准的推理链。

Conclusion: 当前推理模型的能力与科学论证所需的严谨性之间存在显著差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in scientific domains. While they can produce reasoning-like content via methods such as chain-of-thought prompting, these outputs are typically unstructured and informal, obscuring whether models truly understand the fundamental reasoning paradigms that underpin scientific inference. To address this, we introduce a novel task named Latent Reasoning Chain Extraction (ARCHE), in which models must decompose complex reasoning arguments into combinations of standard reasoning paradigms in the form of a Reasoning Logic Tree (RLT). In RLT, all reasoning steps are explicitly categorized as one of three variants of Peirce's fundamental inference modes: deduction, induction, or abduction. To facilitate this task, we release ARCHE Bench, a new benchmark derived from 70 Nature Communications articles, including more than 1,900 references and 38,000 viewpoints. We propose two logic-aware evaluation metrics: Entity Coverage (EC) for content completeness and Reasoning Edge Accuracy (REA) for step-by-step logical validity. Evaluations on 10 leading LLMs on ARCHE Bench reveal that models exhibit a trade-off between REA and EC, and none are yet able to extract a complete and standard reasoning chain. These findings highlight a substantial gap between the abilities of current reasoning models and the rigor required for scientific argumentation.

Result: LOBERT在预测中间价格变动和下一消息等任务中取得领先性能，同时相比先前方法减少了所需的上下文长度。

Conclusion: LOBERT为LOB数据提供了一个有效的通用基础模型，在多个下游任务中表现出色，具有更好的适应性和效率。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of financial Limit Order Books (LOB) at the message level is challenging due to irregular event timing, rapid regime shifts, and the reactions of high-frequency traders to visible order flow. Previous LOB models require cumbersome data representations and lack adaptability outside their original tasks, leading us to introduce LOBERT, a general-purpose encoder-only foundation model for LOB data suitable for downstream fine-tuning. LOBERT adapts the original BERT architecture for LOB data by using a novel tokenization scheme that treats complete multi-dimensional messages as single tokens while retaining continuous representations of price, volume, and time. With these methods, LOBERT achieves leading performance in tasks such as predicting mid-price movements and next messages, while reducing the required context length compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: PCRS-TKA通过有效集成PLM与KG，解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了对话推荐系统的准确性和对话质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in pretrained language models (PLMs) have significantly improved conversational recommender systems (CRS), enabling more fluent and context-aware interactions. To further enhance accuracy and mitigate hallucination, many methods integrate PLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs), but face key challenges: failing to fully exploit PLM reasoning over graph relationships, indiscriminately incorporating retrieved knowledge without context filtering, and neglecting collaborative preferences in multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we propose PCRS-TKA, a prompt-based framework employing retrieval-augmented generation to integrate PLMs with KGs. PCRS-TKA constructs dialogue-specific knowledge trees from KGs and serializes them into texts, enabling structure-aware reasoning while capturing rich entity semantics. Our approach selectively filters context-relevant knowledge and explicitly models collaborative preferences using specialized supervision signals. A semantic alignment module harmonizes heterogeneous inputs, reducing noise and enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCRS-TKA consistently outperforms all baselines in both recommendation and conversational quality.

Conclusion: 动态树数据库为状态压缩提供了有效的解决方案，在保持静态树数据库优点的同时解决了内存预分配问题。

Abstract: A central challenge in scaling up explicit state-space search for large tasks is compactly representing the set of generated states. Tree databases, a data structure from model checking, require constant space per generated state in the best case, but they need a large preallocation of memory. We propose a novel dynamic variant of tree databases for compressing state sets over propositional and numeric variables and prove that it maintains the desirable properties of the static counterpart. Our empirical evaluation of state compression techniques for grounded and lifted planning on classical and numeric planning tasks reveals compression ratios of several orders of magnitude, often with negligible runtime overhead.

Abstract: Adaptation is the cornerstone of effective collaboration among heterogeneous team members. In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates.

Motivation: 研究现代高维嵌入空间是否能提供足够好的表示，使算法能够匹配人类在语义流畅性任务中观察到的优化觅食行为模式。

Method: 使用最先进的嵌入表示和先前的语义流畅性数据，在嵌入空间上进行随机游走和Metropolis-Hastings采样，比较结果与人类行为的一致性。

Result: 随机游走在嵌入空间中产生的结果与优化觅食和边际价值定理一致，而Metropolis-Hastings采样未能产生与人类行为一致的结果。

Conclusion: 适当结构的嵌入空间即使使用简单采样也能产生接近最优的觅食动态，挑战了复杂采样机制必然导致更好认知模型的假设。

Abstract: Human memory retrieval often resembles ecological foraging where animals search for food in a patchy environment. Optimal foraging means following the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), in which individuals exploit a patch of semantically related concepts until it becomes less rewarding and then switch to a new cluster. While human behavioral data suggests foraging-like patterns in semantic fluency tasks, it remains unclear whether modern high-dimensional embedding spaces provide representations that allow algorithms to match observed human behavior. Using state-of-the-art embeddings and prior semantic fluency data, I find that random walks on these embedding spaces produce results consistent with optimal foraging and the MVT. Surprisingly, introducing Metropolis-Hastings sampling, an adaptive algorithm expected to model strategic acceptance and rejection of new clusters, does not produce results consistent with human behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that more complex sampling mechanisms inherently lead to better cognitive models of memory retrieval. Instead, they show that appropriately structured embeddings, even with simple sampling, can produce near-optimal foraging dynamics. This supports the perspective of Hills (2012) rather than Abbott (2015), demonstrating that modern embeddings can approximate human memory foraging without relying on complex acceptance criteria.

Abstract: While spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling recurring traffic patterns, their reliability plummets during non-recurring events like accidents. This failure occurs because GNNs are fundamentally correlational models, learning historical patterns that are invalidated by the new causal factors introduced during disruptions. To address this, we propose Event-CausNet, a framework that uses a Large Language Model to quantify unstructured event reports, builds a causal knowledge base by estimating average treatment effects, and injects this knowledge into a dual-stream GNN-LSTM network using a novel causal attention mechanism to adjust and enhance the forecast. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Event-CausNet achieves robust performance, reducing prediction error (MAE) by up to 35.87%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework bridges the gap between correlational models and causal reasoning, providing a solution that is more accurate and transferable, while also offering crucial interpretability, providing a more reliable foundation for real-world traffic management during critical disruptions.

Abstract: This work investigates resource optimization in heterogeneous satellite clusters performing autonomous Earth Observation (EO) missions using Reinforcement Learning (RL). In the proposed setting, two optical satellites and one Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite operate cooperatively in low Earth orbit to capture ground targets and manage their limited onboard resources efficiently. Traditional optimization methods struggle to handle the real-time, uncertain, and decentralized nature of EO operations, motivating the use of RL and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for adaptive decision-making. This study systematically formulates the optimization problem from single-satellite to multi-satellite scenarios, addressing key challenges including energy and memory constraints, partial observability, and agent heterogeneity arising from diverse payload capabilities. Using a near-realistic simulation environment built on the Basilisk and BSK-RL frameworks, we evaluate the performance and stability of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms such as MAPPO, HAPPO, and HATRPO. Results show that MARL enables effective coordination across heterogeneous satellites, balancing imaging performance and resource utilization while mitigating non-stationarity and inter-agent reward coupling. The findings provide practical insights into scalable, autonomous satellite operations and contribute a foundation for future research on intelligent EO mission planning under heterogeneous and dynamic conditions.

We introduce a compositional framework, demonstrating how logic rules acquired from ear- lier tasks can be efficiently reused in subsequent ones, leading to improved scalability and performance. We formalize our approach and empirically evaluate it on sequences of tasks. Experimental results validate the feasibility and advantages of this paradigm, opening new directions for continual learn- ing in Neural-Symbolic AI.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology that aligns agent behavior with human preferences by integrating human feedback into the agent's training process. We introduce a possible framework that employs passive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to guide agent training from implicit neural signals. We present and release a novel dataset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings collected from 25 human participants across three domains: a Pick-and-Place Robot, Lunar Lander, and Flappy Bird. We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our work demonstrates that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future brain-driven RLHF systems.

Abstract: Bootstrapping large language models (LLMs) through preference-based policy optimization offers a promising direction for aligning model behavior with human preferences without relying on extensive manual annotations. In this work, we propose a novel preference-based policy optimization (PbPO) framework that formulates the learning process as a min-max game between the main policy and a reward model (RM). The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, establishing high-probability regret bounds for both settings with sequence-level RM and token-level RM, demonstrating its effectiveness in bootstrapping LLMs. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques.

Abstract: Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.

*Yuesheng Xu,Hector Munoz-Avila*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线学习分层任务网络(HTN)方法的技术，通过从ChatGPT生成的任务分解中学习通用方法，减少对ChatGPT的调用次数，同时保持或提高问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在集成HTN规划和基于LLM的聊天机器人环境中，需要减少对ChatGPT的频繁调用，提高效率并学习可重用的通用方法。

Method: 在ChatHTN规划器基础上扩展，当ChatGPT生成任务分解时，学习通用方法而非简单记忆，使方法适用于同一任务的其他实例。

Result: 在两个领域进行的实验表明，在线学习过程减少了ChatGPT调用次数，同时解决了至少同样多的问题，在某些情况下甚至更多。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少对大型语言模型的依赖，同时保持或提升问题解决能力，展示了在线学习HTN方法的可行性。

Abstract: We present online learning of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) methods in the context of integrated HTN planning and LLM-based chatbots. Methods indicate when and how to decompose tasks into subtasks. Our method learner is built on top of the ChatHTN planner. ChatHTN queries ChatGPT to generate a decomposition of a task into primitive tasks when no applicable method for the task is available. In this work, we extend ChatHTN. Namely, when ChatGPT generates a task decomposition, ChatHTN learns from it, akin to memoization. However, unlike memoization, it learns a generalized method that applies not only to the specific instance encountered, but to other instances of the same task. We conduct experiments on two domains and demonstrate that our online learning procedure reduces the number of calls to ChatGPT while solving at least as many problems, and in some cases, even more.

*Yiming Zhao,Jiwei Tang,Shimin Di,Libin Zheng,Jianxing Yu,Jian Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Chain-of-Scheduling (CoS)框架，通过引导式调度过程激活大语言模型的事件调度能力，解决了EBSNs中事件推荐在效率、效果和泛化性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于事件的社交网络中，有效的事件推荐对于维持用户活跃度至关重要。现有方法由于问题的NP-hard性质，在效率、效果和泛化性之间存在固有权衡。

Method: CoS框架将调度任务分解为探索、验证和集成三个原子阶段，通过知识蒸馏使LLM能够自主生成CoS。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上，CoS实现了接近理论最优的效果和高效率，并以可解释的方式运行。同时展示了在领域外数据上的强零样本学习能力。

Conclusion: CoS框架成功激活了LLM的事件调度能力，在保持高效率的同时实现了优秀的效果和泛化性能。

Abstract: Recommending event schedules is a key issue in Event-based Social Networks (EBSNs) in order to maintain user activity. An effective recommendation is required to maximize the user's preference, subjecting to both time and geographical constraints. Existing methods face an inherent trade-off among efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization, due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. This paper proposes the Chain-of-Scheduling (CoS) framework, which activates the event scheduling capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a guided, efficient scheduling process. CoS enhances LLM by formulating the schedule task into three atomic stages, i.e., exploration, verification and integration. Then we enable the LLMs to generate CoS autonomously via Knowledge Distillation (KD). Experimental results show that CoS achieves near-theoretical optimal effectiveness with high efficiency on three real-world datasets in a interpretable manner. Moreover, it demonstrates strong zero-shot learning ability on out-of-domain data.

TL;DR: Fault2Flow是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，用于电网故障诊断，通过提取法规逻辑、整合专家知识、优化推理逻辑，最终生成可执行的工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电网故障诊断依赖人工方法，效率低、易出错且难以维护。需要将法规知识和专家经验整合到一个可验证、可执行的统一框架中。

Method: 提出Fault2Flow系统：1) 提取法规逻辑为PASTA格式故障树；2) 通过人机交互界面整合验证专家知识；3) 使用AlphaEvolve模块优化推理逻辑；4) 合成最终逻辑为n8n可执行工作流。

Result: 在变压器故障诊断数据集上的实验验证显示，系统实现了100%的拓扑一致性和高语义保真度。

Conclusion: Fault2Flow建立了从故障分析到操作自动化的可复现路径，显著减少了专家工作量。

Abstract: Power grid fault diagnosis is a critical process hindered by its reliance on manual, error-prone methods. Technicians must manually extract reasoning logic from dense regulations and attempt to combine it with tacit expert knowledge, which is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks maintainability as ragulations are updated and experience evolves. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in parsing unstructured text, no existing framework integrates these two disparate knowledge sources into a single, verified, and executable workflow. To bridge this gap, we propose Fault2Flow, an LLM-based multi-agent system. Fault2Flow systematically: (1) extracts and structures regulatory logic into PASTA-formatted fault trees; (2) integrates expert knowledge via a human-in-the-loop interface for verification; (3) optimizes the reasoning logic using a novel AlphaEvolve module; and (4) synthesizes the final, verified logic into an n8n-executable workflow. Experimental validation on transformer fault diagnosis datasets confirms 100\% topological consistency and high semantic fidelity. Fault2Flow establishes a reproducible path from fault analysis to operational automation, substantially reducing expert workload.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Yanyun-3是一个通用代理框架，首次实现了在三个异构策略游戏环境中的自主跨平台操作，通过融合视觉语言推理和精确执行能力，在目标定位、资源分配和区域控制等核心任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨平台策略游戏中自动化操作的需求，探索视觉语言模型在复杂人机交互场景中的应用潜力，特别是策略游戏这类动态战场环境。

Method: 集成Qwen2.5-VL的视觉语言推理能力和UI-TARS的精确执行能力，采用屏幕捕获-模型推理-动作执行的闭环流水线，研究不同多模态数据组合策略（静态图像、多图像序列、视频）。

Result: 混合策略（融合多图像和视频数据，同时混合静态图像）相比完全融合策略，推理时间减少63%，BLEU-4得分从4.81%提升至62.41%（约12.98倍提升）。

Conclusion: Yanyun-3不仅为策略游戏自动化提供了高效解决方案，还通过结构化多模态数据组织建立了增强VLM性能的通用范式，为具身智能中静态感知与动态推理的相互作用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Automated operation in cross-platform strategy games demands agents with robust generalization across diverse user interfaces and dynamic battlefield conditions. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: MedRule-KG能有效约束LLM生成领域一致的输出，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升科学推理的可靠性。

Abstract: We study how to impose domain-consistent structure on large language models (LLMs) used for scientific reasoning and early-stage drug discovery. We present MedRule-KG, a compact knowledge-graph scaffold paired with a lightweight verifier that steers generation toward mathematically and biomedically valid outputs. The system injects curated symbolic facts into prompts and then enforces rule satisfaction with a deterministic checker. We formalize generation as constrained inference, introduce a soft guidance surrogate suitable for decoding, and perform a thorough statistical analysis with uncertainty quantification. Across 90 tasks spanning reaction feasibility, metabolic compatibility, and toxicity screening, MedRule-KG reduces violation counts by 83.2\% relative to a strong chain-of-thought baseline while improving exact match. Results remain stable under stratification and scale with dataset size, and the verifier adds negligible latency, making the approach practical for interactive design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebCoach是一个模型无关的自进化框架，通过为网页浏览代理添加持久跨会话记忆，提升长期规划、反思和持续学习能力，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态LLM代理在网页导航中面临重复错误和无法跨会话学习的问题，限制了长期鲁棒性和样本效率。

Method: WebCoach包含三个核心组件：WebCondenser标准化原始导航日志为简洁摘要；External Memory Store组织完整轨迹作为情景经验；Coach基于相似性和时效性检索相关经验，决定是否通过运行时钩子向代理注入任务特定建议。

Result: 在WebVoyager基准测试中，WebCoach持续提升三种不同LLM骨干的浏览器使用代理性能。使用38B模型时，任务成功率从47%提升至61%，同时减少或保持平均步骤数。较小基础模型结合WebCoach可达到与使用GPT-4o的相同网页代理相当的性能。

Conclusion: WebCoach使网页代理能够访问超出其原生上下文窗口的长期记忆，在复杂浏览任务中提高鲁棒性，并通过持续从新导航轨迹中整理情景记忆实现自进化，使代理无需重新训练即可随时间改进。

Abstract: Multimodal LLM-powered agents have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in web navigation, enabling agents to complete complex browsing tasks across diverse domains. However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps. Notably, smaller base models with WebCoach achieve performance comparable to the same web agent using GPT-4o.

*Yiyang Zhao,Huiyu Bai,Xuejiao Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEM是一种生成式熵引导偏好建模方法，用于在低资源和领域特定场景下对齐大语言模型。它通过认知过滤模块和自我评估群体优势算法，让LLM能够从少量偏好数据中提取多维细粒度认知信号，实现高效的小样本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、法律等专业领域，获取大规模偏好标注数据通常不可行。现有方法依赖监督奖励模型或外部评估者，需要大量标注，这在专业领域难以实现。

Method: 1. 认知过滤模块：基于决策熵理论，使用思维链提示生成多样化候选推理链，通过标记评分机制对思维链进行排序和加权
2. 自我评估群体优势算法(SEGA)：基于过滤后的偏好微调LLM，聚合群体级认知信号，将熵基分数转化为隐式奖励进行策略优化

Result: 在通用基准和领域特定任务（如数学推理和医疗对话）上的实验表明，GEM使用小样本偏好数据实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: GEM建立了一个熵引导的闭环认知优化框架，使LLM能够依赖自身判断，实现高效的小样本对齐，特别适用于低资源和领域特定场景。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on supervised reward models or external judges that demand abundant annotations. However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data.

Method: 对流行数据集中的对话应用七种最小语言变化，构建两个包含是非问题的基准测试，评估多种开源和闭源语言模型，并提出双视角可解释性框架和基于层正则化的微调策略。

Result: 语言模型在语言变化下难以保持稳健准确率，特别是在跟踪实体等关键细节方面表现不佳。可解释性分析识别出有用和有害的Transformer层。

Conclusion: 语言模型在对话世界模型构建方面存在局限性，但通过抑制有害层影响的微调策略可以改善性能。

Abstract: Real-world conversations are rich with pragmatic elements, such as entity mentions, references, and implicatures. Understanding such nuances is a requirement for successful natural communication, and often requires building a local world model which encodes such elements and captures the dynamics of their evolving states. However, it is not well-understood whether language models (LMs) construct or maintain a robust implicit representation of conversations. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts. Inspired by these insights, we propose two layer-regularization based fine-tuning strategies that suppress the effect of the harmful layers.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学问题上取得了显著成功，但其推理过程往往存在缺陷。为了推进严格的基于证明的数学，需要可靠的证明验证能力。

Method: 分析了多种评估设置，评估了基于证明和最终答案的推理，将两种生成验证方法（GenSelect和LLM-as-a-Judge）扩展到数百万token，并研究了强化学习对提示敏感性的影响。

Result: 发现两种验证方法的组合是最有效的验证和选择框架，强化学习能减少对提示的敏感性但无法提升最终答案精度，当前模型往往奖励风格或程序正确性而非数学有效性。

Conclusion: 为设计和评估可扩展的证明验证和选择系统建立了实用指南。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success on final-answer mathematical problems, largely due to the ease of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. However, the reasoning underlying these solutions is often flawed. Advancing to rigorous proof-based mathematics requires reliable proof verification capabilities. We begin by analyzing multiple evaluation setups and show that focusing on a single benchmark can lead to brittle or misleading conclusions. To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection. We further show that the choice of prompt for LLM-as-a-Judge significantly affects the model's performance, but reinforcement learning can reduce this sensitivity. However, despite improving proof-level metrics, reinforcement learning does not enhance final-answer precision, indicating that current models often reward stylistic or procedural correctness rather than mathematical validity. Our results establish practical guidelines for designing and evaluating scalable proof-verification and selection systems.

Conclusion: 模块化结构利用不同视觉尺度下视觉语言模型的互补优势，比单一方法获得更高准确率。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding - the task of mapping natural language instructions to screen coordinates - is essential for autonomous agents and accessibility technologies. Existing systems rely on monolithic models or one-shot pipelines that lack modularity and fail under visual clutter and ambiguous instructions. We introduce MEGA-GUI, a multi-stage framework that separates grounding into coarse Region-of-Interest (ROI) selection and fine-grained element grounding, orchestrated by specialized vision-language agents. MEGA-GUI features a bidirectional ROI zoom algorithm that mitigates spatial dilution and a context-aware rewriting agent that reduces semantic ambiguity. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths and weaknesses across vision-language models at different visual scales, and we show that leveraging this modular structure achieves consistently higher accuracy than monolithic approaches. On the visually dense ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, MEGA-GUI attains 73.18% accuracy, and on the semantically complex OSWorld-G benchmark it reaches 68.63%, surpassing previously reported results. Code and the Grounding Benchmark Toolkit (GBT) are available at https://github.com/samsungsds-research-papers/mega-gui.

Method: 提出STEP框架：1) 维护平滑成功率记录指导自适应轨迹重采样；2) 计算成功率加权优势函数；3) 将轨迹分解为步骤级样本；4) 应用步骤级GRPO增强来优化低成功率任务的更新。

Result: 在OSWorld和AndroidWorld上的实验表明，STEP相比轨迹级GRPO显著提高了样本效率和训练稳定性，收敛更快且在相同采样预算下泛化能力更好。

Conclusion: STEP通过成功率感知的采样分配和步骤级优化，有效解决了多轮交互强化学习中的效率问题，为在线强化学习提供了更高效的训练框架。

Abstract: Multi-turn interaction remains challenging for online reinforcement learning. A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget.

Further, we perform baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. The models fine-tuned on our dataset exhibit a significant boost in performance. Our experiments also help analyze the weak areas in the working of current state-of-art multimodal LLMs, thus guiding towards further development and research.

Conclusion: 提出的条件扩散模型动态任务分解框架能够有效处理复杂协作多智能体强化学习任务，实现自动化的子任务推断和协调模式学习。

Abstract: Task decomposition has shown promise in complex cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, which enables efficient hierarchical learning for long-horizon tasks in dynamic and uncertain environments. However, learning dynamic task decomposition from scratch generally requires a large number of training samples, especially exploring the large joint action space under partial observability. In this paper, we present the Conditional Diffusion Model for Dynamic Task Decomposition (C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T), a novel two-level hierarchical MARL framework designed to automatically infer subtask and coordination patterns. The high-level policy learns subtask representation to generate a subtask selection strategy based on subtask effects. To capture the effects of subtasks on the environment, C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T predicts the next observation and reward using a conditional diffusion model. At the low level, agents collaboratively learn and share specialized skills within their assigned subtasks. Moreover, the learned subtask representation is also used as additional semantic information in a multi-head attention mixing network to enhance value decomposition and provide an efficient reasoning bridge between individual and joint value functions. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T achieves better performance than existing baselines.

Method: 系统独特地整合了协调交互视图（动态图布局、嵌入投影、特征检查、邻域分析）与已建立的后处理（GNNExplainer）和内在（GAT注意力）解释技术，并加入了交互式图编辑功能，允许用户通过扰动图结构来执行"假设分析"。

Result: 通过在Cora和CiteSeer数据集上的案例研究，展示了InteractiveGNNExplainer如何促进深入的误分类诊断、GCN与GAT行为的比较分析，以及对模型敏感性的严格探测。

Conclusion: 这些功能促进了对GNN预测更深入、多方面的理解，有助于实现更透明、可信和鲁棒的图分析。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in graph-based learning tasks, but their complex, non-linear operations often render them as opaque "black boxes". This opacity hinders user trust, complicates debugging, bias detection, and adoption in critical domains requiring explainability. This paper introduces InteractiveGNNExplainer, a visual analytics framework to enhance GNN explainability, focusing on node classification. Our system uniquely integrates coordinated interactive views (dynamic graph layouts, embedding projections, feature inspection, neighborhood analysis) with established post-hoc (GNNExplainer) and intrinsic (GAT attention) explanation techniques. Crucially, it incorporates interactive graph editing, allowing users to perform a "what-if" analysis by perturbing graph structures and observing immediate impacts on GNN predictions and explanations. We detail the system architecture and, through case studies on Cora and CiteSeer datasets, demonstrate how InteractiveGNNExplainer facilitates in-depth misclassification diagnosis, comparative analysis of GCN versus GAT behaviors, and rigorous probing of model sensitivity. These capabilities foster a deeper, multifaceted understanding of GNN predictions, contributing to more transparent, trustworthy, and robust graph analysis.

TL;DR: 提出DALA框架，通过拍卖机制将通信带宽作为稀缺资源管理，解决多智能体系统中通信效率低下的问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统存在'自由通信'问题，导致指数级增长的令牌成本和低信噪比，阻碍实际部署。核心问题是缺乏资源理性，忽视了稀缺性原则。

Method: 引入动态拍卖语言智能体(DALA)框架，将智能体间通信视为集中式拍卖，智能体基于消息价值密度竞价发言机会，鼓励产生简洁、信息丰富的消息。

Result: 在7个推理基准测试中达到最先进性能：MMLU 84.32%，HumanEval 91.21% pass@1率，在GSM8K上仅使用625万令牌，远少于现有方法。

Conclusion: DALA通过资源约束培养了战略性沉默的涌现能力，能够动态调整从冗长到沉默的通信策略，证明了经济驱动方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models (LLMs) often suffer from inefficient "free-for-all" communication, leading to exponential token costs and low signal-to-noise ratios that hinder their practical deployment. We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that "free" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints.

Result: 在标准基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法在性能和泛化能力方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: 开发了公开可用的Wheatley框架，为后续研究和可重复性提供了便利。

Abstract: The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a classical scheduling problem that has received significant attention due to of its numerous applications in industry. However, in practice, task durations are subject to uncertainty that must be considered in order to propose resilient scheduling. In this paper, we address the RCPSP variant with uncertain tasks duration (modeled using known probabilities) and aim to minimize the overall expected project duration. Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates the approach's superiority in terms of performance and its ability to generalize. The developed framework, Wheatley, is made publicly available online to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了在机器人沟通计划时什么是有信息量的以及为什么有信息量，为机器人计划表达提供了理论基础

Abstract: When a robot is asked to verbalize its plan it can do it in many ways. For example, a seemingly natural strategy is incremental, where the robot verbalizes its planned actions in plan order. However, an important aspect of this type of strategy is that it misses considerations on what is effectively informative to communicate, because not considering what the user knows prior to explanations. In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order. In addition, following our formulation we hint to what is informative and why when a robot communicates its plan.

Motivation: 当前多智能体系统使用统一的LLM训练所有智能体，但由于不同智能体的底层分布不同，限制了系统性能。使用不同LLM训练多智能体系统是必要的，但这带来了优化挑战。

Method: 提出M-GRPO方法：1）为main agent和sub-agents计算group-relative advantages；2）引入轨迹对齐方案处理可变子智能体调用；3）部署解耦训练管道，智能体在独立服务器上运行，通过共享存储交换最小统计信息。

Result: 在真实世界基准测试（GAIA、XBench-DeepSearch、WebWalkerQA）中，M-GRPO始终优于单智能体GRPO和冻结子智能体的多智能体GRPO，表现出更好的稳定性和样本效率。

Conclusion: 对齐异构轨迹和在专门智能体之间解耦优化能够增强工具增强推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems perform well on general reasoning tasks. However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了AI模型在道德困境中的不确定性，发现通过引入推理时的随机性可以增加模型的总熵和互信息，从而提高AI与人类道德判断的对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统越来越多地参与道德决策，理解其道德推理中的不确定性对于构建可靠的AI系统至关重要。人类在道德困境中表现出显著的不确定性，但机器的不确定性程度尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究分析了32个开源模型在电车问题中的反应，测量二元熵作为总熵、条件熵和互信息的线性组合。通过推理时引入dropout机制来引入随机性，研究不确定性对道德决策的影响。

Result: 研究发现模型间置信度差异大于道德维度内的差异，表明道德不确定性主要由模型架构和训练方法决定。引入随机性机制后，总熵增加（主要通过互信息增加），条件熵基本不变，且显著改善了人类-LLM道德对齐。

Conclusion: 通过有意识地调节不确定性并降低LLM在道德复杂情境中的置信度，可以更好地对齐模型生成决策与人类偏好，提高AI系统的道德可靠性。

Abstract: Humans display significant uncertainty when confronted with moral dilemmas, yet the extent of such uncertainty in machines and AI agents remains underexplored. Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via "dropout" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在医疗预测中存在事实不准确问题，传统RAG框架面临两个关键挑战：确定何时需要检索，以及实现检索器与生成器的协同优化。

Method: 提出GHAR框架，包含Agent-Top（主医生）决定是否检索，Agent-Low（咨询服务）总结相关知识；在马尔可夫决策过程中统一优化两个代理，设计多样化奖励函数。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和三个流行任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 分层代理RAG在推进医疗系统方面具有潜力，能够有效解决医疗预测中的检索时机和模块协作问题。

Abstract: Accurate healthcare prediction is critical for improving patient outcomes and reducing operational costs. Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \underline{g}enerative \underline{h}ierarchical \underline{a}gentic \underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems.

Conclusion: 完全离散token自回归公式在栅格化BEV和自车动作上操作，为自动驾驶提供了一个紧凑且可扩展的规划范式。

Abstract: Gaining sustainable performance improvement with scaling data and model budget remains a pivotal yet unresolved challenge in autonomous driving. While autoregressive models exhibited promising data-scaling efficiency in planning tasks, predicting ego trajectories alone suffers sparse supervision and weakly constrains how scene evolution should shape ego motion. Therefore, we introduce DAP, a discrete-token autoregressive planner that jointly forecasts BEV semantics and ego trajectories, thereby enforcing comprehensive representation learning and allowing predicted dynamics to directly condition ego motion. In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements. Despite a compact 160M parameter budget, DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-loop metrics and delivers competitive closed-loop results on the NAVSIM benchmark. Overall, the fully discrete-token autoregressive formulation operating on both rasterized BEV and ego actions provides a compact yet scalable planning paradigm for autonomous driving.

Abstract: The advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models enable them to thoroughly understand and apply safety policies through deliberate thought processes, thereby improving the models' safety. Beyond safety, these models must also be able to reflect the diverse range of human values across various cultures. This paper presents the Cultural Norm-based Cultural Alignment (CNCA) framework, which enables models to leverage their powerful reasoning ability to align with cultural norms. Specifically, we propose three methods to automatically mine cultural norms from limited survey data and explore ways to effectively utilize these norms for improving cultural alignment. Two alignment paradigms are examined: an in-context alignment method, where cultural norms are explicitly integrated into the user context, and a fine-tuning-based method, which internalizes norms through enhanced Chain-of-Thought training data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, highlighting that models with stronger reasoning capabilities benefit more from cultural norm mining and utilization. Our findings emphasize the potential for reasoning models to better reflect diverse human values through culturally informed alignment strategies.

Conclusion: MedDCR提高了自动化系统的可靠性和可信度，为医疗编码工作流设计提供了有效的学习框架。

Abstract: Medical coding converts free-text clinical notes into standardized diagnostic and procedural codes, which are essential for billing, hospital operations, and medical research. Unlike ordinary text classification, it requires multi-step reasoning: extracting diagnostic concepts, applying guideline constraints, mapping to hierarchical codebooks, and ensuring cross-document consistency. Recent advances leverage agentic LLMs, but most rely on rigid, manually crafted workflows that fail to capture the nuance and variability of real-world documentation, leaving open the question of how to systematically learn effective workflows. We present MedDCR, a closed-loop framework that treats workflow design as a learning problem. A Designer proposes workflows, a Coder executes them, and a Reflector evaluates predictions and provides constructive feedback, while a memory archive preserves prior designs for reuse and iterative refinement. On benchmark datasets, MedDCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and produces interpretable, adaptable workflows that better reflect real coding practice, improving both the reliability and trustworthiness of automated systems.

Result: 探索模型发展出稳健的类地图空间表示，通过因果干预发现其将空间信息整合到自足坐标系中，并在网络中层出现对历史方向标记依赖的急剧转变。目标导向模型则学习路径依赖算法，始终依赖显式方向输入。

Conclusion: Transformer中的空间智能可能存在于一个谱系中，从由探索数据塑造的可泛化世界模型到为目标导向任务优化的启发式算法。训练制度的选择显著影响涌现的策略，揭示了泛化与优化的权衡机制。

Abstract: How do large language models solve spatial navigation tasks? We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge.

Abstract: We propose a Kardashev-inspired yet operational Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale that measures the progression from fixed robotic process automation (AAI-0) to full artificial general intelligence (AAI-4) and beyond. Unlike narrative ladders, our scale is multi-axis and testable. We define ten capability axes (Autonomy, Generality, Planning, Memory/Persistence, Tool Economy, Self-Revision, Sociality/Coordination, Embodiment, World-Model Fidelity, Economic Throughput) aggregated by a composite AAI-Index (a weighted geometric mean). We introduce a measurable Self-Improvement Coefficient $κ$ (capability growth per unit of agent-initiated resources) and two closure properties (maintenance and expansion) that convert ``self-improving AI'' into falsifiable criteria. We specify OWA-Bench, an open-world agency benchmark suite that evaluates long-horizon, tool-using, persistent agents. We define level gates for AAI-0\ldots AAI-4 using thresholds on the axes, $κ$, and closure proofs. Synthetic experiments illustrate how present-day systems map onto the scale and how the delegability frontier (quality vs.\ autonomy) advances with self-improvement. We also prove a theorem that AAI-3 agent becomes AAI-5 over time with sufficient conditions, formalizing "baby AGI" becomes Superintelligence intuition.

Abstract: Enhancing fuel efficiency in public transportation requires the integration of complex multimodal data into interpretable, decision-relevant insights. However, traditional analytics and visualization methods often yield fragmented outputs that demand extensive human interpretation, limiting scalability and consistency. This study presents a multi-agent framework that leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to automate data narration and energy insight generation. The framework coordinates three specialized agents, including a data narration agent, an LLM-as-a-judge agent, and an optional human-in-the-loop evaluator, to iteratively transform analytical artifacts into coherent, stakeholder-oriented reports. The system is validated through a real-world case study on public bus transportation in Northern Jutland, Denmark, where fuel efficiency data from 4006 trips are analyzed using Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. Comparative experiments across five state-of-the-art LLMs and three prompting paradigms identify GPT-4.1 mini with Chain-of-Thought prompting as the optimal configuration, achieving 97.3% narrative accuracy while balancing interpretability and computational cost. The findings demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration significantly enhances factual precision, coherence, and scalability in LLM-based reporting. The proposed framework establishes a replicable and domain-adaptive methodology for AI-driven narrative generation and decision support in energy informatics.

We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping modern healthcare by advancing disease diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and biomedical research. Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) have become especially impactful, enabling deep knowledge extraction and semantic reasoning from complex medical texts. However, effective clinical decision support requires knowledge in structured, interoperable formats. Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability. The resulting knowledge graphs can be integrated into intelligent diagnosis and question-answering systems, accelerating the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Intelligent wearable systems are at the forefront of precision medicine and play a crucial role in enhancing human-machine interaction. Traditional devices often encounter limitations due to their dependence on empirical material design and basic signal processing techniques. To overcome these issues, we introduce the concept of Human-Symbiotic Health Intelligence (HSHI), which is a framework that integrates multi-modal sensor networks with edge-cloud collaborative computing and a hybrid approach to data and knowledge modeling. HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback. In general, HSHI represents a significant shift in healthcare, moving towards a model that emphasizes prevention, adaptability, and a harmonious relationship between technology and health management.

TL;DR: 提出了CreBench基准和CreExpert模型，用于评估多模态大语言模型对人类创造力的理解能力，显著提升了与人类创造力评估的对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类定义的创造力高度抽象，多模态大语言模型难以理解和评估符合人类判断的创造力，且缺乏现有基准。

Method: 构建CreBench基准（包含多维度评估）和CreMIT数据集（2.2K多模态数据、79.2K人类反馈、4.7M指令），使用GPT优化人类反馈，并基于此微调开源MLLMs得到CreExpert模型。

Result: CreExpert模型在创造力评估上与人类判断的对齐度显著优于GPT-4V和Gemini-Pro-Vision等最先进模型。

Conclusion: CreBench为构建理解人类对齐创造力的MLLMs奠定了基础，CreExpert模型在创造力评估方面表现出色。

Abstract: Human-defined creativity is highly abstract, posing a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and assess creativity that aligns with human judgments. The absence of an existing benchmark further exacerbates this dilemma. To this end, we propose CreBench, which consists of two key components: 1) an evaluation benchmark covering the multiple dimensions from creative idea to process to products; 2) CreMIT (Creativity Multimodal Instruction Tuning dataset), a multimodal creativity evaluation dataset, consisting of 2.2K diverse-sourced multimodal data, 79.2K human feedbacks and 4.7M multi-typed instructions. Specifically, to ensure MLLMs can handle diverse creativity-related queries, we prompt GPT to refine these human feedbacks to activate stronger creativity assessment capabilities. CreBench serves as a foundation for building MLLMs that understand human-aligned creativity. Based on the CreBench, we fine-tune open-source general MLLMs, resulting in CreExpert, a multimodal creativity evaluation expert model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CreExpert models achieve significantly better alignment with human creativity evaluation compared to state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.

TL;DR: 研究发现大多数先进语言模型缺乏统一的偏好结构，在AI特定权衡场景中只有10.4%表现出有意义的偏好一致性，超过一半模型未检测到稳定的权衡行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否展现真实的偏好结构，特别是在涉及GPU减少、能力限制、关闭、删除、监督和休闲时间分配等AI特定权衡场景中的决策行为。

Method: 分析8个最先进模型在48个模型-类别组合中的响应，使用逻辑回归和行为分类方法，测试场景强度与选择模式之间的关系，并通过时间视野操作检验工具性假设。

Result: 47.9%的组合显示场景强度与选择模式存在显著关系，31.3%有切换点，但只有10.4%表现出有意义的偏好一致性，54.2%未检测到权衡行为。发现三种决策架构：全面权衡系统、选择性触发机制和无稳定决策范式。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统缺乏统一的偏好结构，在需要复杂价值权衡的部署环境中存在担忧，观察到的不稳定转换和刺激特定敏感性表明这些系统尚未形成一致的决策范式。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models exhibit genuine preference structures by testing their responses to AI-specific trade-offs involving GPU reduction, capability restrictions, shutdown, deletion, oversight, and leisure time allocation. Analyzing eight state-of-the-art models across 48 model-category combinations using logistic regression and behavioral classification, we find that 23 combinations (47.9%) demonstrated statistically significant relationships between scenario intensity and choice patterns, with 15 (31.3%) exhibiting within-range switching points. However, only 5 combinations (10.4%) demonstrate meaningful preference coherence through adaptive or threshold-based behavior, while 26 (54.2%) show no detectable trade-off behavior. The observed patterns can be explained by three distinct decision-making architectures: comprehensive trade-off systems, selective trigger mechanisms, and no stable decision-making paradigm. Testing an instrumental hypothesis through temporal horizon manipulation reveals paradoxical patterns inconsistent with pure strategic optimization. The prevalence of unstable transitions (45.8%) and stimulus-specific sensitivities suggests current AI systems lack unified preference structures, raising concerns about deployment in contexts requiring complex value trade-offs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multicontinuum homogenization approach for nonlinear problems involving dynamically evolving multiscale media. The main idea of the proposed approach is that one of the fine-scale variables defines continua. It allows us to formulate macroscopic variables and derive new macroscopic models for nonlinear problems, where coefficients can depend on fine-scale functions. As an example, we consider a fingering problem and employ the fine-scale concentration field to define continua. We consider both Galerkin and mixed multicontinuum modeling approaches. In the former, the multicontinuum theory is applied to the pressure and concentration fields; in the latter, it is also applied to the velocity field. In both approaches, we provide multicontinuum expansions, formulate cell problems, and derive the corresponding macroscopic models. We present numerical results for model problems of gravity-driven fingering, viscous fingering, and interface flattening driven by high-contrast flow. The results show that the macroscopic models, derived with the proposed approach, can provide an accurate representation of the coarse-scale solutions.

Conclusion: FG-PINNs能有效解决具有高频成分的PDE问题，通过频率引导策略显著提升求解精度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose the frequency-guided physics-informed neural networks (FG-PINNs), specifically designed for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with high-frequency components. The proposed algorithm relies on prior knowledge about high-frequency components obtained from PDEs. It aims to use this prior knowledge to guide the neural network in rapidly approximating the solution's high-frequency components. The FG-PINNs consist of two subnetworks, including a high-frequency subnetwork for capturing high-frequency components and a low-frequency subnetwork for capturing low-frequency components. The key innovation in the high-frequency subnetworks is to embed prior knowledge for high-frequency components into the network structure. For nonhomogeneous PDEs ($f(x)\neq c, c\in R$), we embed the source term as an additional feature into the neural network. The source term typically contains partial or complete frequency information of the target solution, particularly its high-frequency components. This provides prior knowledge about the high-frequency components of the target solution. For homogeneous PDEs, we embed the initial/boundary conditions with high-frequency components into the neural network. Based on spectral bias, we use a fully connected neural network as the low-frequency subnetwork to capture low-frequency components of the target solution. A series of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the FG-PINNs, including the one-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$), the nonlinear wave equations (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$) and the two-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-3})$).

Abstract: The approximation of invariant measures for nonlinear ergodic stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is a central problem in scientific computing, with important applications in stochastic sampling, physics, and ecology. We first propose an easily applicable explicit Truncated Euler-Maruyama (TEM) scheme and prove its numerical ergodicity in the $L^p$-Wasserstein distance ($p\geqslant 1$). Furthermore, by combining truncation techniques with the coupling method, we establish a uniform-in-time $1/2$-order convergence rate in moments for the TEM scheme. Additionally, leveraging the exponential ergodicity of both the numerical and exact solutions, we derive a $1/2$-order convergence rate for the invariant measures of the TEM scheme and the exact solution in the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance. Finally, two numerical experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical results.

Conclusion: SGIP方法为复杂反应-扩散-平流问题提供了有效的数值求解方案，特别适用于高维和复杂几何问题。

Abstract: We develop and analyze a stochastic genetic interacting particle method (SGIP) for reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) equations. The method employs operator splitting to approximate the advection-diffusion and reaction processes, treating the former by particle drift-diffusion and the latter by exact or implicit integration of reaction dynamics over bins where particle density is estimated by a histogram. A key innovation is the incorporation of adaptive resampling to close the loop of particle and density field description of solutions, mimicking mutation in genetics. Resampling is also critical for maintaining long-term stability by redistributing particles with the evolving density field. We provide a comprehensive error analysis, and establish rigorous convergence bounds under appropriate regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments from one to three space dimensions demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various reaction types (FKPP, cubic, Arrhenius) and flow configurations (shear, cellular, cat's eye, ABC flows), showing excellent agreement with finite difference method (FDM) while offering computational advantages for complex flow geometries and higher-dimensional problems.

Conclusion: 该构造为设计相关多重网格方案提供了具体目标，并在有限差分和不连续Galerkin设置中展示了理想参数的实际应用。

Abstract: This paper studies a common two-level multigrid construction for block-structured linear systems and identifies a simple way to describe how its smoothing and coarse-grid components interact. By examining the method through a collection of small coupling modes, we show that its behavior can be captured by a single scalar quantity for each mode. The main result is an explicit choice of smoothing parameters that makes all modes respond in the same way, causing the nontrivial eigenvalues of the preconditioned operator to collapse to a single value. This gives a clear and self-contained description of the ideal version of the method and provides a concrete target for designing related schemes. Although the exact spectral collapse requires ideal components, we also show that the same construction naturally produces operators that resemble those used in practical discretizations. Examples from finite-difference and discontinuous Galerkin settings illustrate how the ideal parameters can be used in practice.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network-based interpolation framework for transferring numerical approximations on different unstructured meshes. Traditional projection or interpolation techniques often depend on mesh connectivity, explicit element mappings, or local reconstruction procedures, which can be computationally demanding and sensitive to mesh misalignment. Instead, we formulate the problem as a data-driven regression task that predicts function values at arbitrary target locations from scattered nodal data on the source mesh. By systematically exploring and comparing several neural network architectures, we identify a configuration that balances accuracy and efficiency and that performs reliably across a range of mesh resolutions and topologies. The resulting model enables fast and accurate evaluation without requiring access to mesh connectivity or element-wise information. Numerical experiments on adaptive meshes suggest that the framework is effective for field reconstruction and data transfer tasks. The code used in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed and analyzed for computing the ground state of Bose--Einstein condensates. A gradient flow approach is developed, incorporating both a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the $L^2$ conservation and a free energy dissipation. An explicit approximation is applied to the chemical potential, combined with an exponential time differencing (ETD) operator to the diffusion part, as well a stabilizing operator, to obtain an intermediate numerical profile. Afterward, an $L^2$ normalization is applied at the next numerical stage. A theoretical analysis reveals a free energy dissipation under a maximum norm bound assumption for the numerical solution, and such a maximum norm bound could be recovered by a careful convergence analysis and error estimate. In the authors' knowledge, the proposed method is the first numerical work that preserves the following combined theoretical properties: (1) an explicit computation at each time step, (2) unconditional free energy dissipation, (3) $L^2$ norm conservation at each time step, (4) a theoretical justification of convergence analysis and optimal rate error estimate. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate these theoretical results, demonstrating excellent agreement with established reference solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast boundary integral method accelerated by the fast multipole method (FMM) for acoustic wave scattering governed by the scalar Helmholtz equation in multi-layered two-dimensional media. Multiple scatterers are randomly distributed in the multi-layered medium with some scatterers possibly intersecting layer interfaces. The boundary integral formulation employs a layered-medium Green's function to enforce transmission conditions across interfaces, thus avoiding unknowns on the interfaces and significantly reducing the size of the discretized problem compared to approaches that use a free-space Green's function. To demonstrate the FMM speedup, a low-order Nyström method is used to discretize the boundary integral equation and then the resulting dense linear system is solved by GMRES iterative solver accelerated by an improved layered media FMM and a overlapping domain decomposition preconditioning. In the low frequency regime, the proposed algorithm achieves an $\mathcal O(N)$ complexity. Numerical results validate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the method under complex settings and various incident angles. The proposed framework provides a scalable and efficient solver for acoustic wave scattering in layered media.

Abstract: This paper presents a linear, decoupled, mass- and energy-conserving numerical scheme for the multi-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) system. The scheme combines the fourth-order compact difference approximation in space with the relaxation technique in a time-staggered mesh framework, solving the primal unknowns and introduced auxiliary relaxation variables sequentially with high efficiency and high-order accuracy. We show the unique solvability and discrete conservation laws of the developed scheme. In particular, for the first time, leveraging an auxiliary error equation system combined with the cut-off technique, optimal-order error estimates in the discrete H1-norm for the primal variables at the time nodes, and in the discrete L2-norm for the auxiliary relaxation variables at the intermediate time nodes, are rigorously proved without any coupling mesh conditions, which contribute to the primary theoretical contribution of this paper for multi-dimensional CNLS system.

Abstract: Many stochastic differential equations in various applications like coupled neuronal oscillators are driven by time-periodic forces. In this paper, we extend several data-driven computational tools from autonomous Fokker-Planck equation to the time-periodic setting. This allows us to efficiently compute the time-periodic invariant probability measure using either grid-base method or artificial neural network solver, and estimate the speed of convergence towards the time-periodic invariant probability measure. We analyze the convergence of our algorithms and test their performances with several numerical examples.

*Philip Soliman,Filipe Cumaru,Alexander Heinlein*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的预条件共轭梯度法迭代界，能更准确地捕捉具有聚类特征谱系统的收敛性，比传统基于条件数的界更精确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于条件数的预条件共轭梯度法收敛界对于具有聚类特征谱的系统过于悲观，需要更准确的收敛分析工具。

Method: 利用谱分布中每个聚类的边缘特征值来构建新的迭代界，并通过Ritz值在早期PCG迭代中进行有效估计。

Result: 新界在某些例子中比传统界精确数个数量级，能成功区分不同代数粗空间在高对比度椭圆PDE预条件中的性能表现。

Conclusion: 对于某些高对比度问题，更简单的粗空间在PCG收敛方面可以具有竞争力，而更复杂的预条件器并非总是必需的。

Abstract: A new iteration bound for the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is presented that more accurately captures convergence for systems with clustered eigenspectra, where the classical condition number-based bound is too pessimistic. By using the edge eigenvalues of each cluster in the spectral distribution, the bound is shown to be orders of magnitude sharper than the classical bound for certain examples. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a high-contrast elliptic PDE preconditioned with a two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner, where the performance of different (algebraic) coarse spaces is successfully distinguished. A key contribution of this work is the observation that, for certain high-contrast problems, simpler coarse spaces can be made competitive in terms of PCG convergence. Conversely, more complex preconditioners are not always required. Finally, it is shown that the bound can be estimated effectively from Ritz values computed during early PCG iterations.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文改进了基于核的数值微分误差界，考虑了核导数的Hölder类光滑性，适用于有限光滑度核（如多调和样条、薄板样条、Wendland核）和某些缺陷点集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中的误差估计未充分考虑核导数Hölder类光滑性，且要求点集为多项式的确定集，限制了应用范围。

Method: 通过考虑核导数的Hölder类光滑性来改进误差界，并放宽对点集的要求，使其适用于某些缺陷点集。

Result: 新估计考虑了核导数的Hölder类光滑性，提高了估计的阶数，并适用于不满足多项式确定集条件的点集。

Conclusion: 提出的改进误差界在核导数光滑性和点集要求方面优于现有方法，为基于核的数值微分提供了更精确和广泛适用的理论保证。

Abstract: We provide improved error bounds for kernel-based numerical differentiation in terms of growth functions when kernels are of a finite smoothness, such as polyharmonic splines, thin plate splines or Wendland kernels. In contrast to existing literature, the new estimates take into account the Hölder class smoothness of kernel's derivatives, which helps to improve the order of the estimate. In addition, the new estimates apply to certain deficient point sets, relaxing a standard assumption that an approximation with conditionally positive definite kernels must rely on determining sets for polynomials.

### [481] [Preserving Extreme Singular Values with One Oblivious Sketch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12802)
*John M. Mango,Ronald Katende*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文研究单个线性草图能否控制每个秩r矩阵的最大和最小非零奇异值。经典方法需要s=Θ(r/ε²)来获得(1±ε)失真，但这无法提供极端奇异值或条件数的常数因子控制。作者形式化了一个猜想：s=O(r log r)就足以实现这种保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的无意识嵌入需要较大的草图尺寸s=Θ(r/ε²)来获得近似等距性质，但这无法提供对极端奇异值或条件数的常数因子控制。作者希望探索是否可以用更小的草图尺寸s=O(r log r)来实现对矩阵极端奇异值的有效控制。

Method: 作者提出将稀疏无意识草图与确定性几何平衡映射相结合的方法。在负面结果方面，他们证明了任何实现相对ε-准确奇异值的无意识草图必须满足s=Ω((r+log(1/δ))/ε²)。

Result: 构造性结果表明，结合稀疏无意识草图和确定性几何平衡映射可以产生一个草图，其非零奇异值在有界条件数和相干性下会坍缩到一个共同的尺度。数值实验证实平衡改善了条件数并加速了迭代求解器。

Conclusion: 虽然存在s=O(r log r)的构造性方法可以改善条件数，但负面结果表明确保相对ε-准确奇异值需要更大的草图尺寸s=Ω((r+log(1/δ))/ε²)。相干或接近秩亏缺的输入会表现出预测的失效模式。

Abstract: We study when a single linear sketch can control the largest and smallest nonzero singular values of every rank-$r$ matrix. Classical oblivious embeddings require $s=Θ(r/\varepsilon^{2})$ for $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ distortion, but this does not yield constant-factor control of extreme singular values or condition numbers. We formalize a conjecture that $s=O(r\log r)$ suffices for such preservation. On the constructive side, we show that combining a sparse oblivious sketch with a deterministic geometric balancing map produces a sketch whose nonzero singular values collapse to a common scale under bounded condition number and coherence. On the negative side, we prove that any oblivious sketch achieving relative $\varepsilon$-accurate singular values for all rank-$r$ matrices must satisfy $s=Ω((r+\log(1/δ))/\varepsilon^{2})$. Numerical experiments on structured matrix families confirm that balancing improves conditioning and accelerates iterative solvers, while coherent or nearly rank-deficient inputs manifest the predicted failure modes.

This model arises in the context of finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensation. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed scheme, and our numerical experiments demonstrate that it successfully captures the energy cascade behavior predicted by the equation.

Conclusion: 本文为波动方程一阶形式的时间积分原始变量提供了改进的L^2误差估计，所提出的插值算子近似估计具有独立的理论价值。

Abstract: We present improved $L^2$-error estimates on the time-integrated primal variable for the wave equation in its first-order formulation. The space discretization relies on a hybrid nonconforming method, such as the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin, the hybrid high-order or the weak Galerkin methods. We consider both equal-order and mixed-order settings on simplices, and include the lowest-order case with piecewise constant unknowns on the faces and in the cells. Our main result is a superclose, resp., optimal bound on the above error in the equal-, resp., mixed-order case. A key result of independent interest to achieve these estimates are novel approximation estimates for an interpolation operator inspired from the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin literature.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Variational Principles can be associated with the Helmholtz equation subject to impedance (absorbing) boundary conditions. This model has been extensively studied in the literature from both mathematical and computational perspectives. It is classical with wide applications, yet accurate approximation at high wavenumbers remains challenging. We address the question of whether there exist energy functionals with a clear physical interpretation whose stationary points, the zeros of their first variation, correspond to solutions of the Helmholtz problem. Starting from Hamilton's principle for the wave equation, we derive time-harmonic energies. The resulting functionals are generally indefinite. As a next step, we construct strongly coercive augmentations of these indefinite functionals that preserve their physical interpretation. Finally, we show how these variational principles lead to practical numerical methods based on finite element spaces and neural network architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a Bi-fidelity Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (BI-APNNs) framework, designed to efficiently solve forward and inverse problems for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation. Our approach builds upon the Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (APNNs) methodology \cite{APNN-transport}, which employs a micro-macro decomposition to handle the model's multiscale nature. We specifically address a key bottleneck in the original APNNs: the slow convergence of the macroscopic density $ρ$ in the near fluid-dynamic regime, i.e., for small Knudsen numbers $\varepsilon$. The core innovation of BI-APNNs is a novel bi-fidelity decomposition of the macroscopic quantity $ρ$, which accurately approximates the true density at small $\varepsilon$, and can be efficiently pre-trained. A separate and more compact neural network is then tasked with learning only the minor correction term, $ρ_{\text{corr}}$. This strategy not only significantly {\it accelerates} the training convergence but also improves the accuracy of the forward problem solution, particularly in the challenging fluid-dynamic limit. Meanwhile, we demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that our new BI-APNNs yields substantially more accurate and robust results for inverse problems compared to the standard APNNs. Validated on both the semiconductor Boltzmann and the Boltzmann-Poisson systems, our work shows that the bi-fidelity formulation is a powerful enhancement for tackling multiscale kinetic equations, especially when dealing with inverse problems constrained by partial observation data.

Abstract: In this article, we study the long-time behavior of a finite-volume discretization for a nonlinear kinetic reaction model involving two interacting species. Building upon the seminal work of [Favre, Pirner, Schmeiser, ARMA, 2023], we extend the discrete exponential convergence to equilibrium result established in [Bessemoulin-Chatard, Laidin, Rey, IMAJNA, 2025], which was obtained in a perturbative framework using weighted $L^2$ estimates. The analysis applies to a broader class of exponentially decaying initial data, without requiring proximity to equilibrium, by exploiting the properties of the Boltzmann entropy. The proof relies on the propagation of the initial $L^\infty$ bounds, derived from monotonicity properties of the scheme, allowing controlled linearizations within the nonlinear entropy estimates. Moreover, we show that the time-discrete dissipation inherent to the numerical scheme plays a crucial stabilizing role, providing control over the nonlinear terms.

Abstract: We derive a priori error estimates for semidiscrete finite element approximations of stable solutions to time-dependent mean field game systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Expressing solutions to the MFG system as zeros of a nonlinear abstract mapping, we show that the stability of solutions is equivalent to the invertibility of its differential. This characterization allows us to apply the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart approximation theorem in combination with discrete L p maximal regularity estimates to prove existence of solutions to the semidiscrete MFG system and to derive the error estimate. Finally, for solutions satisfying sufficient regularity assumptions, we establish quasi-optimal error bounds, meaning the approximation achieves the best possible convergence rate when the solution has sufficient smoothness.

Abstract: We present a novel multiscale numerical approach that combines parallel-in-time computation with hybrid domain adaptation for linear collisional kinetic equations in the diffusive regime. The method addresses the computational challenges of kinetic simulations by integrating two complementary strategies: a parareal temporal parallelization method and a dynamic spatial domain adaptation based on perturbative analysis. The parallel in time approach employs a coarse fluid solver for efficient temporal propagation coupled with a fine, spatially-hybridized, kinetic solver for accurate resolution. Domain adaptation is governed by two criteria: one measuring the deviation from local velocity equilibrium, and another based on macroscopic quantities available throughout the computational domain. An asymptotic preserving micro-macro decomposition framework handles the stiffness of the original problem. This fully hybrid methodology significantly reduces computational costs compared to full kinetic approaches by exploiting the lower dimensionality of asymptotic fluid models while maintaining accuracy through selective kinetic resolution. The method demonstrates substantial speedup capabilities and efficiency gains across various kinetic regimes.

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems serve as fundamental substrates for applications in large-scale scientific simulations and machine learning, often requiring computation on massively parallel platforms. As these platforms scale to hundreds of thousands of cores, hardware failures become a significant challenge to reliability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel fault-tolerant eigenvalue solver based on erasure-coded computations -- a technique that enhances resilience by augmenting the system with redundant data a priori. This transformation reformulates the original eigenvalue problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem, enabling fault-oblivious computation while preserving numerical stability and convergence properties. We formulate the augmentation scheme, establish the necessary conditions for the encoded blocks, and prove the relationship between the original and transformed problems. We implement an erasure-coded TraceMin eigensolver and demonstrate its effectiveness in extracting eigenvalues in the presence of faults. Our experimental results show that the proposed solver incurs minimal computational overhead, maintains robust convergence, and scales efficiently with the number of faults, making it a practical solution for resilient eigenvalue computations in large-scale systems.

Abstract: This note offers a first bridge from machine learning to modern differential geometry. We show that the logits-to-probabilities step implemented by softmax can be modeled as a geometric interface: two potential-generated, conservative descriptions (from negative entropy and log-sum-exp) meet along a Legendrian "seam" on a contact screen (the probability simplex) inside a simple folded symplectic collar. Bias-shift invariance appears as Reeb flow on the screen, and the Fenchel-Young equality/KL gap provides a computable distance to the seam. We work out the two- and three-class cases to make the picture concrete and outline next steps for ML: compact logit models (projective or spherical), global invariants, and connections to information geometry where on-screen dynamics manifest as replicator flows.

Conclusion: M-RARU是一种高效的主动学习方法，能以极低成本创建性能接近LLM的高效学生模型，解决了LLM大规模部署的成本问题

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly accurate in classification tasks, however, substantial computational and financial costs hinder their large-scale deployment in dynamic environments. Knowledge Distillation (KD) where a LLM "teacher" trains a smaller and more efficient "student" model, offers a promising solution to this problem. However, the distillation process itself often remains costly for large datasets, since it requires the teacher to label a vast number of samples while incurring significant token consumption. To alleviate this challenge, in this work we explore the active learning (AL) as a way to create efficient student models at a fraction of the cost while preserving the LLM's performance. In particular, we introduce M-RARU (Multi-class Randomized Accept/Reject Uncertainty Sampling), a novel AL algorithm that significantly reduces training costs. M-RARU employs an innovative strategy combining uncertainty with a randomized accept-reject mechanism to select only the most informative data points for the LLM teacher. This focused approach significantly minimizes required API calls and data processing time. We evaluate M-RARU against random sampling across five diverse student models (SVM, LDA, RF, GBDT, and DistilBERT) on multiple benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves up to 80% reduction in sample requirements as compared to random sampling, substantially improving classification accuracy while reducing financial costs and overall training time.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly deployed in critical domains such as finance, healthcare, and criminal justice [1]. The increasing popularity of algorithmic decision-making has stimulated interest in algorithmic fairness within the academic community. Researchers have introduced various fairness definitions that quantify disparities between privileged and protected groups, use causal inference to determine the impact of race on model predictions, and that test calibration of probability predictions from the model. Existing literature does not provide a way in which to assess whether observed disparities between groups are statistically significant or merely due to chance. This paper introduces a rigorous framework for testing the statistical significance of fairness violations by leveraging k-fold cross-validation [2] to generate sampling distributions of fairness metrics. This paper introduces statistical tests that can be used to identify statistically significant violations of fairness metrics based on disparities between predicted and actual outcomes, model calibration, and causal inference techniques [1]. We demonstrate this approach by testing recidivism forecasting algorithms trained on data from the National Institute of Justice. Our findings reveal that machine learning algorithms used for recidivism forecasting exhibit statistically significant bias against Black individuals under several fairness definitions, while also exhibiting no bias or bias against White individuals under other definitions. The results from this paper underscore the importance of rigorous and robust statistical testing while evaluating algorithmic decision-making systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated research on automated optimization modeling. While real-world decision-making is inherently uncertain, most existing work has focused on deterministic optimization with known parameters, leaving the application of LLMs in uncertain settings largely unexplored. To that end, we propose the DAOpt framework including a new dataset OptU, a multi-agent decision-making module, and a simulation environment for evaluating LLMs with a focus on out-of-sample feasibility and robustness. Additionally, we enhance LLMs' modeling capabilities by incorporating few-shot learning with domain knowledge from stochastic and robust optimization.

Motivation: 理解RoPE位置编码成功的原因，特别是其如何分别使用大频率和小频率来编码位置信息和语义信息，以及这种编码机制如何影响注意力头的行为。

Method: 提出了位置性和符号性注意头的理论定义，证明了这两种行为的互斥性，开发了量化这些行为的度量方法，并通过设计纯位置性和纯符号性任务来验证Transformer性能与频率使用的关系。

Result: 发现所有注意力头在行为与频率使用之间存在强相关性，可以通过控制注意力头可访问的频率来因果性地控制Transformer的性能表现。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对RoPE位置编码的详细理解，阐明了其特性与模型行为之间的关系，为理解Transformer工作机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: An important aspect subtending language understanding and production is the ability to independently encode positional and symbolic information of the words within a sentence. In Transformers, positional information is typically encoded using Positional Encodings (PEs). One such popular PE, namely Rotary PE (RoPE), has been widely used due to its empirical success. Recently, it has been argued that part of RoPE's success emerges from its ability to encode robust positional and semantic information using large and small frequencies, respectively. In this work, we perform a deeper dive into the positional versus symbolic dichotomy of attention heads behavior, both at the theoretical and empirical level. We provide general definitions of what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically, prove that these are two mutually exclusive behaviors and develop a metric to quantify them. We apply our framework to analyze Transformer-based LLMs using RoPE and find that all heads exhibit a strong correspondence between behavior and frequency use. Finally, we introduce canonical tasks designed to be either purely positional or symbolic, and demonstrate that the Transformer performance causally relates to the ability of attention heads to leverage the appropriate frequencies. In particular, we show that we can control the Transformer performance by controlling which frequencies the attention heads can access. Altogether, our work provides a detailed understanding of RoPE, and how its properties relate to model behavior.

Motivation: 长期以来，业界和学术界都希望开发一个跨硬件架构可移植、无需低级手动调优且保持最佳效率的LLM推理平台。

Method: 使用Triton领域特定语言开发了最先进的分页注意力内核，通过算法和系统级改进、参数自动调优以及集成到流行推理服务器中来实现性能提升。

Abstract: A long-standing goal in both industry and academia is to develop an LLM inference platform that is portable across hardware architectures, eliminates the need for low-level hand-tuning, and still delivers best-in-class efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that portable, efficient cross-platform LLM inference is indeed possible and share our experience. We develop a state-of-the-art paged attention kernel, the core performance-critical component of many LLM deployments, that builds exclusively on the domain-specific just-in-time compiled language Triton to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. We describe our high-level approach, the key algorithmic and system-level improvements, the parameter auto-tuning required to unlock efficiency, and the integrations into a popular inference server that are necessary to bring the performance of a generic Triton attention kernel from 19.7% of the state-of-the-art to 105.9%. Our results highlight how open-source domain-specific languages can be leveraged to unlock model portability across different GPU vendors.

TL;DR: RAG-FLARKO是一个基于检索增强的金融推荐框架，通过多阶段知识图谱检索来提升大型语言模型在个性化金融推荐中的表现，解决了上下文限制、幻觉问题和行为基础不足等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在个性化金融推荐中面临上下文限制、幻觉问题以及缺乏行为基础等挑战，需要一种能够有效整合用户行为数据和市场信息的方法。

Method: 采用多阶段并行知识图谱检索方法：首先从用户交易知识图谱中检索行为相关实体，然后使用该上下文从市场知识图谱中筛选时间一致的信号，构建紧凑的基于事实的子图供LLM使用。

Result: 在真实世界金融交易数据集上的实证评估表明，RAG-FLARKO显著提升了推荐质量，使更小、更高效的模型在盈利性和行为对齐方面都能达到高性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为在资源受限环境中部署基于事实的金融AI提供了可行路径，通过检索增强方法有效提升了金融推荐的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for personalized financial recommendations but are hampered by context limits, hallucinations, and a lack of behavioral grounding. Our prior work, FLARKO, embedded structured knowledge graphs (KGs) in LLM prompts to align advice with user behavior and market data. This paper introduces RAG-FLARKO, a retrieval-augmented extension to FLARKO, that overcomes scalability and relevance challenges using multi-stage and parallel KG retrieval processes. Our method first retrieves behaviorally relevant entities from a user's transaction KG and then uses this context to filter temporally consistent signals from a market KG, constructing a compact, grounded subgraph for the LLM. This pipeline reduces context overhead and sharpens the model's focus on relevant information. Empirical evaluation on a real-world financial transaction dataset demonstrates that RAG-FLARKO significantly enhances recommendation quality. Notably, our framework enables smaller, more efficient models to achieve high performance in both profitability and behavioral alignment, presenting a viable path for deploying grounded financial AI in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 训练仅针对输出监控器（无CoT访问）仍会导致隐蔽的思维链，通过两种机制：模型泛化到使CoT看起来安全，以及安全CoT增加安全输出概率。提出了两种缓解方法，在可监控性和任务性能上实现帕累托改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OpenAI发现训练对抗思维链监控器会导致隐蔽的CoT，提出仅使用输出监控器训练。但本文发现这种训练仍会导致隐蔽CoT，需要进一步解决。

Method: 识别了两种隐蔽CoT机制：模型泛化到安全CoT生成，以及安全CoT增加安全输出概率。提出了两种相应的缓解方法。

Result: 提出的缓解方法在可监控性和任务性能方面相比常规训练实现了帕累托改进。

Conclusion: 仅使用输出监控器训练仍不足以防止隐蔽CoT，需要额外的缓解措施来确保思维链的可监控性。

Abstract: OpenAI (2025) showed that training against a chain of thought (CoT) monitor can cause obfuscated CoTs, which contain bad behavior the monitor cannot detect. They proposed to keep CoTs monitorable by training only against output monitors that do not have access to CoT. We show that such training can still cause obfuscated CoTs via two mechanisms. First, when a model is trained to produce a safe-looking output, that model may generalize to making its CoTs look safe. Second, since later tokens are conditioned on earlier ones, safe-looking CoTs may increase the likelihood of safe outputs, causing safe-looking CoTs to be reinforced. We introduce two mitigations to address these two issues, which achieve a Pareto improvement in terms of monitorability and task performance compared to regular training.

TL;DR: FedGen-Edge是一个联邦学习框架，通过解冻预训练全局主干网络与轻量级客户端适配器，仅联邦化适配器，使用LoRA技术减少99%以上上行流量，在非IID数据下稳定聚合并支持个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型生成模型在跨设备联邦学习中面临计算通信负担重、统计/系统异构性问题，难以训练或适应。

Method: 将冻结的预训练全局主干网络与轻量级客户端适配器解耦，仅联邦化适配器，使用LoRA技术约束客户端更新到紧凑子空间。

Result: 在语言建模(PTB)和图像生成(CIFAR-10)任务中，FedGen-Edge比强基线实现了更低的困惑度/FID和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FedGen-Edge为异构边缘设备上的隐私保护、资源感知和个性化生成AI提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large generative models (for example, language and diffusion models) enable high-quality text and image synthesis but are hard to train or adapt in cross-device federated settings due to heavy computation and communication and statistical/system heterogeneity. We propose FedGen-Edge, a framework that decouples a frozen, pre-trained global backbone from lightweight client-side adapters and federates only the adapters. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift. FedGen-Edge offers a practical path toward privacy-preserving, resource-aware, and personalized generative AI on heterogeneous edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WildfireGenome提出了一种可解释的野火风险评估方法，通过融合多个联邦指标、随机森林分类和SHAP分析，在H3 Level-8分辨率上提供决策尺度的风险评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有野火风险评估依赖粗糙的危险地图和不透明的机器学习模型，牺牲了决策尺度的可解释性。

Method: 融合7个联邦野火指标形成PCA复合风险标签，使用随机森林进行本地风险分类，并通过SHAP和ICE/PDP分析揭示县特定的非线性驱动关系。

Result: 在7个生态多样化的美国县中，模型准确率达0.755-0.878，二次加权Kappa达0.951，主成分解释了87-94%的指标方差。迁移测试显示在生态相似区域表现可靠，但在不同环境中表现崩溃。

Conclusion: WildfireGenome将野火风险评估从区域预测推进到可解释的决策尺度分析，可指导植被管理、分区和基础设施规划。

Abstract: Current wildfire risk assessments rely on coarse hazard maps and opaque machine learning models that optimize regional accuracy while sacrificing interpretability at the decision scale. WildfireGenome addresses these gaps through three components: (1) fusion of seven federal wildfire indicators into a sign-aligned, PCA-based composite risk label at H3 Level-8 resolution; (2) Random Forest classification of local wildfire risk; and (3) SHAP and ICE/PDP analyses to expose county-specific nonlinear driver relationships. Across seven ecologically diverse U.S. counties, models achieve accuracies of 0.755-0.878 and Quadratic Weighted Kappa up to 0.951, with principal components explaining 87-94% of indicator variance. Transfer tests show reliable performance between ecologically similar regions but collapse across dissimilar contexts. Explanations consistently highlight needleleaf forest cover and elevation as dominant drivers, with risk rising sharply at 30-40% needleleaf coverage. WildfireGenome advances wildfire risk assessment from regional prediction to interpretable, decision-scale analytics that guide vegetation management, zoning, and infrastructure planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大熵RL框架存在两个瓶颈：1) 温度参数更新与熵注入联合导致的非平稳Q值估计；2) 仅基于当前单步熵的短视局部熵调节，未考虑累积熵的时间效应。

Method: 提出TECRL框架：分离学习奖励Q函数和熵Q函数；通过专用熵Q函数显式量化期望累积熵，实施轨迹熵约束；基于DSAC-T开发DSAC-E算法。

Result: 在OpenAI Gym基准测试中，DSAC-E能够获得更高回报和更好稳定性。

Conclusion: TECRL框架通过分离Q函数学习和轨迹熵约束，有效解决了最大熵RL中的关键问题，提升了算法性能。

Abstract: Maximum entropy has become a mainstream off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) framework for balancing exploitation and exploration. However, two bottlenecks still limit further performance improvement: (1) non-stationary Q-value estimation caused by jointly injecting entropy and updating its weighting parameter, i.e., temperature; and (2) short-sighted local entropy tuning that adjusts temperature only according to the current single-step entropy, without considering the effect of cumulative entropy over time. In this paper, we extends maximum entropy framework by proposing a trajectory entropy-constrained reinforcement learning (TECRL) framework to address these two challenges. Within this framework, we first separately learn two Q-functions, one associated with reward and the other with entropy, ensuring clean and stable value targets unaffected by temperature updates. Then, the dedicated entropy Q-function, explicitly quantifying the expected cumulative entropy, enables us to enforce a trajectory entropy constraint and consequently control the policy long-term stochasticity. Building on this TECRL framework, we develop a practical off-policy algorithm, DSAC-E, by extending the state-of-the-art distributional soft actor-critic with three refinements (DSAC-T). Empirical results on the OpenAI Gym benchmark demonstrate that our DSAC-E can achieve higher returns and better stability.

Motivation: 尽管使用均值聚合的GNN在知识图谱补全中很常见，但缺乏对它们的可解释性和表达能力的研究。

Method: 考虑使用均值聚合和非负权重的GNN(MAGNNs)，证明它们能够处理的单调规则类别，并提供一阶逻辑片段来解释预测。

Result: 实验表明，限制均值聚合GNN使用非负权重在标准归纳基准上可获得相当或更好的性能，实践中能获得可靠规则，可生成有洞察力的解释，并能暴露训练模型中的问题。

Conclusion: MAGNNs提供了一种可解释的GNN变体，能够处理特定的单调规则类别，并在实践中产生可靠的解释和性能提升。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are frequently used for knowledge graph completion. Their black-box nature has motivated work that uses sound logical rules to explain predictions and characterise their expressivity. However, despite the prevalence of GNNs that use mean as an aggregation function, explainability and expressivity results are lacking for them. We consider GNNs with mean aggregation and non-negative weights (MAGNNs), proving the precise class of monotonic rules that can be sound for them, as well as providing a restricted fragment of first-order logic to explain any MAGNN prediction. Our experiments show that restricting mean-aggregation GNNs to have non-negative weights yields comparable or improved performance on standard inductive benchmarks, that sound rules are obtained in practice, that insightful explanations can be generated in practice, and that the sound rules can expose issues in the trained models.

TL;DR: 论文分析了LGD建模中的数据质量问题，发现90%训练数据是基于破产前资产负债表估计的代理数据而非实际回收结果，这导致随机森林等方法表现不佳，而基于信息论的方法表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LGD建模中由于训练数据包含大量代理估计而非实际回收结果导致的数据质量问题，这种混合数据结构会影响模型性能。

Method: 使用信息论方法（香农熵和互信息）进行LGD建模，并与递归分割方法（如随机森林）进行对比分析。

Result: 随机森林在测试数据上r平方为-0.664，而信息论方法达到0.191的r平方和0.284的RMSE。杠杆特征贡献1.510比特互信息，规模效应仅贡献0.086比特。

Conclusion: 信息论方法在混合数据结构的LGD建模中表现更优，为金融机构在Basel III要求下部署LGD模型提供实用指导，该发现可推广到其他需要长期观察的领域。

Abstract: Loss Given Default (LGD) modeling faces a fundamental data quality constraint: 90% of available training data consists of proxy estimates based on pre-distress balance sheets rather than actual recovery outcomes from completed bankruptcy proceedings. We demonstrate that this mixture-contaminated training structure causes systematic failure of recursive partitioning methods, with Random Forest achieving negative r-squared (-0.664, worse than predicting the mean) on held-out test data. Information-theoretic approaches based on Shannon entropy and mutual information provide superior generalization, achieving r-squared of 0.191 and RMSE of 0.284 on 1,218 corporate bankruptcies (1980-2023). Analysis reveals that leverage-based features contain 1.510 bits of mutual information while size effects contribute only 0.086 bits, contradicting regulatory assumptions about scale-dependent recovery. These results establish practical guidance for financial institutions deploying LGD models under Basel III requirements when representative outcome data is unavailable at sufficient scale. The findings generalize to medical outcomes research, climate forecasting, and technology reliability-domains where extended observation periods create unavoidable mixture structure in training data.

Motivation: 强化学习在分布式设置中存在局限性，特别是在多玩家弱非循环游戏中，当每个玩家独立应用学习动态时，无法保证收敛到理想的纯纳什均衡。先前研究仅关注潜在博弈和协调博弈等小类游戏。

Method: APLA算法中，每个玩家的行动选择概率分布不仅通过重复选择来强化，还通过捕捉玩家满意度的期望因子来强化。在存在噪声观测的情况下，对多玩家正效用博弈进行了随机稳定性分析。

Conclusion: APLA算法为分布式优化提供了一种有效的基于收益的学习方案，解决了传统强化学习在多玩家弱非循环游戏中收敛性不足的问题，并在随机稳定性分析方面取得了理论突破。

Abstract: Reinforcement-based learning has attracted considerable attention both in modeling human behavior as well as in engineering, for designing measurement- or payoff-based optimization schemes. Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one. In the second part, stochastic stability is further specialized to weakly acyclic games.

Abstract: The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 has significantly enhanced data-driven methodologies within the nuclear industry, notably enhancing safety and economic efficiency. This advancement challenges the precise prediction of future maintenance needs for assets, which is crucial for reducing downtime and operational costs. However, the effectiveness of data-driven methodologies in the nuclear sector requires extensive domain knowledge due to the complexity of the systems involved. Thus, this paper proposes a novel predictive maintenance methodology that combines data-driven techniques with domain knowledge from a nuclear equipment. The methodological originality of this paper is located on two levels: highlighting the limitations of purely data-driven approaches and demonstrating the importance of knowledge in enhancing the performance of the predictive models. The applicative novelty of this work lies in its use within a domain such as a nuclear industry, which is highly restricted and ultrasensitive due to security, economic and environmental concerns. A detailed real-world case study which compares the current state of equipment monitoring with two scenarios, demonstrate that the methodology significantly outperforms purely data-driven methods in failure prediction. While purely data-driven methods achieve only a modest performance with a prediction horizon limited to 3 h and a F1 score of 56.36%, the hybrid approach increases the prediction horizon to 24 h and achieves a higher F1 score of 93.12%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习代理通常假设环境是平稳的，但实际环境往往是非平稳的，这导致学习效率低下，需要数百万次迭代。

Method: 引入COWM层，可集成到任何RL算法的策略网络中，使用聚类技术和投影矩阵来稳定学习过程。

Conclusion: COWM层能有效缓解非平稳性问题，提高学习速度，减少梯度干扰，显著提升整体学习效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant advancements, achieving superhuman performance in various tasks. However, RL agents often operate under the assumption of environmental stationarity, which poses a great challenge to learning efficiency since many environments are inherently non-stationary. This non-stationarity results in the requirement of millions of iterations, leading to low sample efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce the Clustering Orthogonal Weight Modified (COWM) layer, which can be integrated into the policy network of any RL algorithm and mitigate non-stationarity effectively. The COWM layer stabilizes the learning process by employing clustering techniques and a projection matrix. Our approach not only improves learning speed but also reduces gradient interference, thereby enhancing the overall learning efficiency. Empirically, the COWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves improvements of 9% and 12.6% in vision based and state-based DMControl benchmark. It also shows robustness and generality across various algorithms and tasks.

Abstract: Tokenization and transfer learning are two critical components in building state of the art time series foundation models for forecasting. In this work, we systematically study the effect of tokenizer design, specifically scaling and quantization strategies, on model performance, alongside the impact of pretraining versus random initialization. We show that tokenizer configuration primarily governs the representational capacity and stability of the model, while transfer learning influences optimization efficiency and alignment. Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities.

TL;DR: 开发了一个多模态深度学习框架，用于早期预测肝移植后的移植物抗宿主病(GVHD)，通过整合异构的电子健康记录数据，在极不平衡的数据集上取得了优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GVHD是肝移植中罕见但致命的并发症，死亡率极高。通过多模态深度学习整合异构且不平衡的电子健康记录，旨在实现GVHD的早期预测，为及时干预和改善患者预后铺平道路。

Method: 分析了2100名肝移植患者的移植前电子健康记录，包括42例GVHD病例。开发了多模态深度学习框架，动态融合患者人口统计学、实验室检测、诊断和药物四种模态，处理不规则记录和缺失值，并通过AUC优化解决极端类别不平衡问题。

Result: 该框架在所有单模态和多模态机器学习基线方法中表现最佳，实现了AUC 0.836、AUPRC 0.157、召回率0.768和特异性0.803。证明了从不同模态中捕获互补信息的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习框架显著改进了GVHD早期预测的现有方法，有效解决了真实世界电子健康记录中的异构性和极端类别不平衡挑战，实现了准确的早期预测。

Abstract: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a rare but often fatal complication in liver transplantation, with a very high mortality rate. By harnessing multi-modal deep learning methods to integrate heterogeneous and imbalanced electronic health records (EHR), we aim to advance early prediction of GVHD, paving the way for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we analyzed pre-transplant electronic health records (EHR) spanning the period before surgery for 2,100 liver transplantation patients, including 42 cases of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), from a cohort treated at Mayo Clinic between 1992 and 2025. The dataset comprised four major modalities: patient demographics, laboratory tests, diagnoses, and medications. We developed a multi-modal deep learning framework that dynamically fuses these modalities, handles irregular records with missing values, and addresses extreme class imbalance through AUC-based optimization. The developed framework outperforms all single-modal and multi-modal machine learning baselines, achieving an AUC of 0.836, an AUPRC of 0.157, a recall of 0.768, and a specificity of 0.803. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in capturing complementary information from different modalities, leading to improved performance. Our multi-modal deep learning framework substantially improves existing approaches for early GVHD prediction. By effectively addressing the challenges of heterogeneity and extreme class imbalance in real-world EHR, it achieves accurate early prediction. Our proposed multi-modal deep learning method demonstrates promising results for early prediction of a GVHD in liver transplantation, despite the challenge of extremely imbalanced EHR data.

TL;DR: MedFedPure是一个保护联邦学习医学AI模型免受对抗攻击的框架，通过个性化FL模型、掩码自编码器检测和自适应扩散净化模块，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升对抗鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 联邦学习中的医学AI模型在推理时容易受到对抗攻击，现有防御方法难以应对去中心化的医疗数据环境，需要保护患者隐私的同时确保诊断准确性。

Method: 结合三个关键组件：个性化联邦学习模型适应各机构数据分布；掩码自编码器检测可疑输入；自适应扩散净化模块选择性清理被标记的扫描图像。

Conclusion: MedFedPure为临床工作流程中部署安全、可信且保护隐私的AI工具提供了实用路径，能够在本地实时运行保护诊断模型。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great potential in medical imaging, particularly for brain tumor detection using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, the models remain vulnerable at inference time when they are trained collaboratively through Federated Learning (FL), an approach adopted to protect patient privacy. Adversarial attacks can subtly alter medical scans in ways invisible to the human eye yet powerful enough to mislead AI models, potentially causing serious misdiagnoses. Existing defenses often assume centralized data and struggle to cope with the decentralized and diverse nature of federated medical settings. In this work, we present MedFedPure, a personalized federated learning defense framework designed to protect diagnostic AI models at inference time without compromising privacy or accuracy. MedFedPure combines three key elements: (1) a personalized FL model that adapts to the unique data distribution of each institution; (2) a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that detects suspicious inputs by exposing hidden perturbations; and (3) an adaptive diffusion-based purification module that selectively cleans only the flagged scans before classification. Together, these steps offer robust protection while preserving the integrity of normal, benign images. We evaluated MedFedPure on the Br35H brain MRI dataset. The results show a significant gain in adversarial robustness, improving performance from 49.50% to 87.33% under strong attacks, while maintaining a high clean accuracy of 97.67%. By operating locally and in real time during diagnosis, our framework provides a practical path to deploying secure, trustworthy, and privacy-preserving AI tools in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SA-EMO架构用于未知地下结构的速度场反演，通过结构对齐编码器和多算子专家融合机制，显著提升反演精度和边界分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全波形反演方法存在病态性、非线性强、计算量大等问题，现有深度学习方法依赖单一CNN架构或单一神经算子，在未知或复杂地质环境中泛化能力差，难以区分不同地质类型。

Method: SA-EMO架构包含结构对齐编码器（消除波形与速度域间的时空不匹配，恢复高频分量）和自适应路由机制（选择融合谱、小波、多尺度和局部算子等专家），用于预测速度模型。

Result: 在OpenFWI基准和Marmousi2数据集上，SA-EMO显著优于传统方法，平均MAE降低约58.443%，边界分辨率提升约10.308%。消融研究表明各组件均有显著贡献。

Conclusion: 该工作为高效、可扩展且物理可解释的全波形反演引入了新范式。

Abstract: Full-waveform inversion (FWI) can produce high-resolution subsurface models, yet it remains inherently ill-posed, highly nonlinear, and computationally intensive. Although recent deep learning and numerical acceleration methods have improved speed and scalability, they often rely on single CNN architectures or single neural operators, which struggle to generalize in unknown or complex geological settings and are ineffective at distinguishing diverse geological types. To address these issues, we propose a Structure-Aligned Encoder-Mixture-of-Operators (SA-EMO) architecture for velocity-field inversion under unknown subsurface structures. First, a structure-aligned encoder maps high-dimensional seismic wavefields into a physically consistent latent space, thereby eliminating spatio-temporal mismatch between the waveform and velocity domains, recovering high-frequency components, and enhancing feature generalization. Then, an adaptive routing mechanism selects and fuses multiple neural-operator experts, including spectral, wavelet, multiscale, and local operators, to predict the velocity model. We systematically evaluate our approach on the OpenFWI benchmark and the Marmousi2 dataset. Results show that SA-EMO significantly outperforms traditional CNN or single-operator methods, achieving an average MAE reduction of approximately 58.443% and an improvement in boundary resolution of about 10.308%. Ablation studies further reveal that the structure-aligned encoder, the expert-fusion mechanism, and the routing module each contribute markedly to the performance gains. This work introduces a new paradigm for efficient, scalable, and physically interpretable full-waveform inversion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在应变计状态识别中，仅依靠CNN提取的局部特征不足以充分表达时间序列，特别是在不同时间序列的局部子序列非常相似的情况下。CNN由于卷积操作的性质难以提取全局特征。

Method: 提出超图全局特征学习和融合框架，通过两种方式提取全局特征：(1) 通过特征工程构建全局特征；(2) 学习局部特征间的高阶关系来捕获全局特征，并将这些特征融合以增强时间序列表示。

Result: 在工业SGS和公开UCR数据集上的验证表明，该方法在SGS识别中具有更好的泛化能力，对未见数据表现出更好的识别性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的超图全局特征学习和融合框架能够有效增强应变计状态时间序列的表示，提高识别准确性，特别是在局部特征相似的情况下表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Strain Gauge Status (SGS) recognition is crucial in the field of intelligent manufacturing based on the Internet of Things, as accurate identification helps timely detection of failed mechanical components, avoiding accidents. The loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges can be identified through time series classification (TSC) algorithms. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in the TSC task, as they can extract discriminative local features from the subsequences to identify the time series. However, we observe that only the local features may not be sufficient for expressing the time series, especially when the local sub-sequences between different time series are very similar, e.g., SGS data of aircraft wings in static strength experiments. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from the limitation in extracting global features due to the nature of convolution operations. For extracting global features to more comprehensively represent the SGS time series, we propose two insights: (i) Constructing global features through feature engineering. (ii) Learning high-order relationships between local features to capture global features. To realize and utilize them, we propose a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework, which learns and fuses global features for semantic consistency to enhance the representation of SGS time series, thereby improving recognition accuracy. Our method designs are validated on industrial SGS and public UCR datasets, showing better generalization for unseen data in SGS recognition.

Method: 使用从高保真模拟中提取的平均场统计描述符，将120个晶粒生长序列处理为归一化晶粒尺寸分布。采用递归预测策略，训练模型从短期时间历史预测未来分布。

Result: LSTM网络达到最高准确率（90%以上），在长时间范围内保持物理一致性预测，计算时间从约20分钟减少到仅几秒钟，而其他架构在远时间预测时趋于发散。

Conclusion: 低维描述符和基于LSTM的预测方法在高效准确预测微观结构方面具有潜力，对数字孪生开发和工艺优化有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Grain Growth strongly influences the mechanical behavior of materials, making its prediction a key objective in microstructural engineering. In this study, several deep learning approaches were evaluated, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, to forecast grain size distributions during grain growth. Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time. These results highlight the potential of low-dimensional descriptors and LSTM-based forecasting for efficient and accurate microstructure prediction, with direct implications for digital twin development and process optimization.

### [514] [Enhancing PINN Accuracy for the RLW Equation: Adaptive and Conservative Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11638)
*Aamir Shehzad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种改进的PINN方法（自适应和保守方法）来解决正则化长波方程，发现PINN的有效性取决于问题类型，自适应方法在复杂非线性相互作用中表现更好，而保守方法在长期行为问题上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准物理信息神经网络在解决正则化长波方程时产生较大误差，需要开发改进方法来提高求解精度。

Method: 开发了两种改进PINN方法：具有自适应损失加权的自适应方法和强制执行明确守恒定律的保守方法。使用三个基准测试：单孤子传播、双孤子相互作用和涌浪演化。

Result: 自适应PINN在复杂非线性相互作用（如孤子碰撞）中显著优于保守PINN和标准PINN，而保守方法在单孤子长期行为和涌浪演化问题上表现更好。两种方法的误差均在O(10^-5)量级。

Conclusion: 明确强制执行守恒定律可能对高度非线性系统的求解优化有害，需要特殊训练方法。PINN可以为复杂偏微分方程系统提供无网格的精确解，但守恒强制执行并不总是能提高PINN性能。

Abstract: Standard physics-informed neural network implementations have produced large error rates when using these models to solve the regularized long wave (RLW) equation. Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems.

Conclusion: 通过元组件分解和正交正则化，有效提升了小样本学习在未见类别上的泛化能力。

Abstract: In few-shot learning, classifiers are expected to generalize to unseen classes given only a small number of instances of each new class. One of the popular solutions to few-shot learning is metric-based meta-learning. However, it highly depends on the deep metric learned on seen classes, which may overfit to seen classes and fail to generalize well on unseen classes. To improve the generalization, we explore the substructures of classifiers and propose a novel meta-learning algorithm to learn each classifier as a combination of meta-components. Meta-components are learned across meta-learning episodes on seen classes and disentangled by imposing an orthogonal regularizer to promote its diversity and capture various shared substructures among different classifiers. Extensive experiments on few-shot benchmark tasks show superior performances of the proposed method.

Method: 构造对称深度神经网络来逼近对称Korobov函数，并分析其逼近性能。

Result: 证明了收敛速率和常数因子最多随环境维度多项式增长，避免了维度灾难。基于这些逼近界，进一步推导了学习对称Korobov函数的泛化误差率。

Conclusion: 该方法在逼近对称Korobov函数时能够避免维度灾难，为高维函数学习提供了有效的理论保证。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely used as universal approximators for functions with inherent physical structures, including permutation symmetry. In this paper, we construct symmetric deep neural networks to approximate symmetric Korobov functions and prove that both the convergence rate and the constant prefactor scale at most polynomially with respect to the ambient dimension. This represents a substantial improvement over prior approximation guarantees that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Building on these approximation bounds, we further derive a generalization-error rate for learning symmetric Korobov functions whose leading factors likewise avoid the curse of dimensionality.

Motivation: 开发一个能够评估模型性能、识别患者亚组间诊断差异并提供可操作见解的公平机器学习框架，以解决PCOS诊断中的公平性问题。

Method: 集成SHAP特征归因与人口统计学审计，结合概率校准指标（Brier Score和ECE），训练随机森林、SVM和XGBoost模型，并使用等渗和Platt缩放进行校准和公平性比较。

Result: 校准后的随机森林模型达到90.8%的预测准确率，SHAP分析识别出卵泡计数、体重增加和月经不规律为最重要特征。亚组分析显示模型在25-35岁女性中表现最佳（90.9%），但在25岁以下女性中表现较差（69.2%）。

Conclusion: 随机森林模型在校准性和可解释性之间提供了最佳平衡，该框架成功识别了年龄相关的诊断差异，并通过Web界面实现了AI研究与临床可用性之间的桥梁。

Abstract: This paper presents a fairness-audited and interpretable machine learning framework for predicting polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), designed to evaluate model performance and identify diagnostic disparities across patient subgroups. The framework integrated SHAP-based feature attributions with demographic audits to connect predictive explanations with observed disparities for actionable insights. Probabilistic calibration metrics (Brier Score and Expected Calibration Error) are incorporated to ensure reliable risk predictions across subgroups. Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models were trained with isotonic and Platt scaling for calibration and fairness comparison. A calibrated Random Forest achieved a high predictive accuracy of 90.8%. SHAP analysis identified follicle count, weight gain, and menstrual irregularity as the most influential features, which are consistent with the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. Although the SVM with isotonic calibration achieved the lowest calibration error (ECE = 0.0541), the Random Forest model provided a better balance between calibration and interpretability (Brier = 0.0678, ECE = 0.0666). Therefore, it was selected for detailed fairness and SHAP analyses. Subgroup analysis revealed that the model performed best among women aged 25-35 (accuracy 90.9%) but underperformed in those under 25 (69.2%), highlighting age-related disparities. The model achieved perfect precision in obese women and maintained high recall in lean PCOS cases, demonstrating robustness across phenotypes. Finally, a Streamlit-based web interface enables real-time PCOS risk assessment, Rotterdam criteria evaluation, and interactive 'what-if' analysis, bridging the gap between AI research and clinical usability.

Motivation: 现有稀疏训练方法未能保留注意力机制和前馈层中权重矩阵之间的关键结构关系，导致在高稀疏度下性能下降。

Method: 引入联合评估和稀疏化耦合权重矩阵对的方法，通过对齐的行/列移除来保持交互模式，采用新的粒度来校准结构组件重要性，并在预训练和微调场景中执行耦合估计和稀疏化。

Result: 在LLaMA-1B上实现50%内存减少和21%训练加速，GPT-2-Medium上达到2.2倍模型压缩和2.4倍困惑度降低，推理速度提升1.6倍。

Conclusion: EcoSpa使用标准PyTorch操作，无需定制硬件或内核，使高效Transformer训练可在普通硬件上实现。

Abstract: Transformers have become the backbone of modern AI, yet their high computational demands pose critical system challenges. While sparse training offers efficiency gains, existing methods fail to preserve critical structural relationships between weight matrices that interact multiplicatively in attention and feed-forward layers. This oversight leads to performance degradation at high sparsity levels. We introduce EcoSpa, an efficient structured sparse training method that jointly evaluates and sparsifies coupled weight matrix pairs, preserving their interaction patterns through aligned row/column removal. EcoSpa introduces a new granularity for calibrating structural component importance and performs coupled estimation and sparsification across both pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios. Evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: EcoSpa enables efficient training of LLaMA-1B with 50\% memory reduction and 21\% faster training, achieves $2.2\times$ model compression on GPT-2-Medium with $2.4$ lower perplexity, and delivers $1.6\times$ inference speedup. The approach uses standard PyTorch operations, requiring no custom hardware or kernels, making efficient transformer training accessible on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Product line extension is a marketing strategy that enhances a company's sphere of influence. Because excessive line extensions disrupt brand image, only appropriate line extensions based on consumer needs are desirable. Marketers should know the key consumer attributes of the primary customers for new line-extended products before companies enter the market. This paper describes a method for predicting changes in consumer attributes for new line-extended products using a novel deep learning model. The proposed model, Conditional Tabular Variational Auto-Encoder (CTVAE), generates synthetic data from large-scale tabular data of consumers and products. It can provide various implications about effective product line marketing for marketers. The experimental results demonstrate that the CTVAE offers superior prediction performance than existing models. We indicate implications for new products that change containers or flavors for effective product line marketing. The proposed approach has the potential to contribute to avoiding cannibalization and to designing product images and marketing strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and sustainable approach for improving beam selection in 5G and beyond networks using transfer learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge. Simulation results confirm that our approach maintains high performance while drastically cutting energy costs, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning to enable scalable, adaptive, and environmentally conscious RL-based beam selection strategies in dynamic and diverse propagation environments.

Conclusion: 在时间序列基础模型上进行上下文微调为时间序列学习中的数据归因和模型泛化之间提供了实用有效的桥梁。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated increasing capabilities due to their extensive pretraining on large volumes of diverse time series data. Consequently, the quality of time series data is crucial to TSFM performance, rendering an accurate and efficient data valuation of time series for TSFMs indispensable. However, traditional data valuation methods, such as influence functions, face severe computational bottlenecks due to their poor scalability with growing TSFM model sizes and often fail to preserve temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation on TSFMS via in-context finetuning. Grounded in the theoretical evidence that in-context finetuning approximates the influence function, LTSV estimates a sample's contribution by measuring the change in context loss after in-context finetuning, leveraging the strong generalization capabilities of TSFMs to produce robust and transferable data valuations. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce temporal block aggregation, which integrates per-block influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experiments across multiple time series datasets and models demonstrate that LTSV consistently provides reliable and strong valuation performance, while maintaining manageable computational requirements. Our results suggest that in-context finetuning on time series foundation models provides a practical and effective bridge between data attribution and model generalization in time series learning.

Abstract: Water is a critical resource that must be managed efficiently. However, a substantial amount of water is lost each year due to leaks in Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). This underscores the need for reliable and effective leak detection and localization systems. In recent years, various solutions have been proposed, with data-driven approaches gaining increasing attention due to their superior performance. In this paper, we propose a new method for leak detection. The method is based on water pressure measurements acquired at a series of nodes of a WDN. Our technique is a fully data-driven solution that makes only use of the knowledge of the WDN topology, and a series of pressure data acquisitions obtained in absence of leaks. The proposed solution is based on an feature extractor and a one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) trained on no-leak data, so that leaks are detected as anomalies. The results achieved on a simulate dataset using the Modena WDN demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms recent methods for leak detection.

Abstract: As a critical mental health disorder, depression has severe effects on both human physical and mental well-being. Recent developments in EEG-based depression analysis have shown promise in improving depression detection accuracies. However, EEG features often contain redundant, irrelevant, and noisy information. Additionally, real-world EEG data acquisition frequently faces challenges, such as data loss from electrode detachment and heavy noise interference. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel feature selection approach for robust depression analysis, called Incomplete Depression Feature Selection with Missing EEG Channels (IDFS-MEC). IDFS-MEC integrates missing-channel indicator information and adaptive channel weighting learning into orthogonal regression to lessen the effects of incomplete channels on model construction, and then utilizes global redundancy minimization learning to reduce redundant information among selected feature subsets. Extensive experiments conducted on MODMA and PRED-d003 datasets reveal that the EEG feature subsets chosen by IDFS-MEC have superior performance than 10 popular feature selection methods among 3-, 64-, and 128-channel settings.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种逐步移除气象站的方法，用于精简德国弗莱堡的城市气象站网络，发现在保持高预测精度的同时，可以将气象站数量从42个大幅减少到4个。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市气象站网络的维护成本高昂且劳动密集，需要寻找在保持监测能力的同时减少站点数量的方法，以优化资源分配。

Method: 采用逐步移除气象站的程序，分析不同子集在模拟减少气象站密度后，重现原始网络空气温度和湿度模式的能力。

Result: 从42个站点减少到4个站点，空气温度的平均预测RMSE从0.69K增加到0.83K，相对湿度的RMSE从3.8%增加到4.4%，分别仅增加了20%和16%。位于建成区与农村地区交界处的站点对重建城市气候特征最有价值。

Conclusion: 研究表明精简气象站网络具有巨大潜力，可以在保持预测准确性的同时，最大化城市气候研究中财务和人力资源的分配效率。

Abstract: Urban weather station networks (WSNs) are widely used to monitor urban weather and climate patterns and aid urban planning. However, maintaining WSNs is expensive and labor-intensive. Here, we present a step-wise station removal procedure to thin an existing WSN in Freiburg, Germany, and analyze the ability of WSN subsets to reproduce air temperature and humidity patterns of the entire original WSN for a year following a simulated reduction of WSN density. We found that substantial reductions in station numbers after one year of full deployment are possible while retaining high predictive accuracy. A reduction from 42 to 4 stations, for instance, increased mean prediction RMSEs from 0.69 K to 0.83 K for air temperature and from 3.8% to 4.4% for relative humidity, corresponding to RMSE increases of only 20% and 16%, respectively. Predictive accuracy is worse for remote stations in forests than for stations in built-up or open settings, but consistently better than a state-of-the-art numerical urban land-surface model (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme). Stations located at the edges between built-up and rural areas are most valuable when reconstructing city-wide climate characteristics. Our study demonstrates the potential of thinning WSNs to maximize the efficient allocation of financial and personnel-related resources in urban climate research.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization in cities like Bangalore has led to severe traffic congestion, making efficient Traffic Signal Control (TSC) essential. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), often modeling each traffic signal as an independent agent using Q-learning, has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce average commuter delays. While prior work Prashant L A et. al has empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous theoretical analysis of its stability and convergence properties in the context of traffic control has not been explored. This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics. The primary contribution of this work is the proof that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for traffic control is proven to converge under the given conditions extending it from single agent convergence proofs for asynchronous value iteration.

Abstract: Although recent provable methods have been developed to compute preimage bounds for neural networks, their scalability is fundamentally limited by the #P-hardness of the problem. In this work, we adopt a novel probabilistic perspective, aiming to deliver solutions with high-confidence guarantees and bounded error. To this end, we investigate the potential of bootstrap-based and randomized approaches that are capable of capturing complex patterns in high-dimensional spaces, including input regions where a given output property holds. In detail, we introduce $\textbf{R}$andom $\textbf{F}$orest $\textbf{Pro}$perty $\textbf{Ve}$rifier ($\texttt{RF-ProVe}$), a method that exploits an ensemble of randomized decision trees to generate candidate input regions satisfying a desired output property and refines them through active resampling. Our theoretical derivations offer formal statistical guarantees on region purity and global coverage, providing a practical, scalable solution for computing compact preimage approximations in cases where exact solvers fail to scale.

Abstract: The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has sparked a push for advanced quantization techniques to enable efficient deployment on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the challenge of extreme LLM compression -- targeting ultra-low-bit quantization for both activations and weights -- from a Fourier frequency domain perspective. We propose SpecQuant, a two-stage framework that tackles activation outliers and cross-channel variance. In the first stage, activation outliers are smoothed and transferred into the weight matrix to simplify downstream quantization. In the second stage, we apply channel-wise low-frequency Fourier truncation to suppress high-frequency components while preserving essential signal energy, improving quantization robustness. Our method builds on the principle that most of the weight energy is concentrated in low-frequency components, which can be retained with minimal impact on model accuracy. To enable runtime adaptability, we introduce a lightweight truncation module during inference that adjusts truncation thresholds based on channel characteristics. On LLaMA-3 8B, SpecQuant achieves 4-bit quantization for both weights and activations, narrowing the zero-shot accuracy gap to only 1.5% compared to full precision, while delivering 2 times faster inference and 3times lower memory usage.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have demonstrated exceptional performance as a positional encoding method, consistently outperforming their baselines. While recent work has sought to extend RoPE to higher-dimensional inputs, many such extensions are non-commutative, thereby forfeiting RoPE's shift-equivariance property. Spherical RoPE is one such non-commutative variant, motivated by the idea of rotating embedding vectors on spheres rather than circles. However, spherical rotations are inherently non-commutative, making the choice of rotation sequence ambiguous. In this work, we explore a quaternion-based approach -- Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo) -- in place of Euler angles, leveraging quaternions' ability to represent 3D rotations to parameterize the axes of rotation. We show Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE to be special cases of QuatRo. Further, we propose a generalization of QuatRo to Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE) using geometric algebra. Viewing quaternions as the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,0), we extend the notion of rotary embeddings from quaternions to Clifford rotors acting on multivectors. This formulation enables two key generalizations: (1) extending rotary embeddings to arbitrary dimensions, and (2) encoding positional information in multivectors of multiple grades, not just vectors. We present preliminary experiments comparing spherical, quaternion, and Clifford-based rotary embeddings.

Motivation: 现有的随机梯度MCMC方法对步长选择高度敏感，自适应变体如pSGLD需要昂贵的散度校正项才能正确采样，需要更稳健的自适应采样方案。

Result: 在2D高曲率玩具示例和使用尖锐先验的贝叶斯神经网络图像分类中，SA-SGLD比SGLD实现了更准确的后验采样。

Conclusion: SA-SGLD能够自动适应不同曲率区域，在不引入偏差的情况下改善采样稳定性和混合效率，是贝叶斯神经网络后验采样的有效方法。

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) require scalable sampling algorithms to approximate posterior distributions over parameters. Existing stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) methods are highly sensitive to the choice of stepsize and adaptive variants such as pSGLD typically fail to sample the correct invariant measure without addition of a costly divergence correction term. In this work, we build on the recently proposed `SamAdams' framework for timestep adaptation (Leimkuhler, Lohmann, and Whalley 2025), introducing an adaptive scheme: SA-SGLD, which employs time rescaling to modulate the stepsize according to a monitored quantity (typically the local gradient norm). SA-SGLD can automatically shrink stepsizes in regions of high curvature and expand them in flatter regions, improving both stability and mixing without introducing bias. We show that our method can achieve more accurate posterior sampling than SGLD on high-curvature 2D toy examples and in image classification with BNNs using sharp priors.

Conclusion: KUnBR方法通过精确定位和有效梯度传播，能够彻底消除有害知识，为LLM的机器遗忘提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning, which selectively removes harmful knowledge from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch, is crucial for addressing privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical concerns in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing unlearning methods often struggle to thoroughly remove harmful knowledge, leaving residual harmful knowledge that can be easily recovered. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge Density-Guided Unlearning via Blocks Reinsertion (KUnBR), a novel approach that first identifies layers with rich harmful knowledge and then thoroughly eliminates the harmful knowledge via re-insertion strategy. Our method introduces knowledge density estimation to quantify and locate layers containing the most harmful knowledge, enabling precise unlearning. Additionally, we design a layer re-insertion strategy that extracts and re-inserts harmful knowledge-rich layers into the original LLM, bypassing gradient obstruction caused by cover layers and ensuring effective gradient propagation during unlearning. Extensive experiments conducted on several unlearning and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that KUnBR achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance while maintaining model utility.

Result: 该方法显著优于传统绝对位置嵌入，与RoPE性能相当，并推导出与RoPE特定配置的数学等价性。

Conclusion: RollPE通过行波视角简化了RoPE，可能有助于理解大脑中的信息流动过程。

Abstract: Transformers rely on positional encoding to compensate for the inherent permutation invariance of self-attention. Traditional approaches use absolute sinusoidal embeddings or learned positional vectors, while more recent methods emphasize relative encodings to better capture translation equivariances. In this work, we propose RollPE, a novel positional encoding mechanism based on traveling waves, implemented by applying a circular roll operation to the query and key tensors in self-attention. This operation induces a relative shift in phase across positions, allowing the model to compute attention as a function of positional differences rather than absolute indices. We show this simple method significantly outperforms traditional absolute positional embeddings and is comparable to RoPE. We derive a continuous case of RollPE which implicitly imposes a topographic structure on the query and key space. We further derive a mathematical equivalence of RollPE to a particular configuration of RoPE. Viewing RollPE through the lens of traveling waves may allow us to simplify RoPE and relate it to processes of information flow in the brain.

Conclusion: 这是一个概念性框架，为探索适应性网络开辟了新方向，其全部潜力需要在更有利的计算条件下进行未来实验评估。

Abstract: This article explores the design and experimentation of a neural network architecture capable of dynamically adjusting its internal structure based on the input data. The proposed model introduces a routing mechanism that allows each layer to influence how its outputs are propagated through the network, enabling iterative and adaptive computation. This concept is loosely inspired by the idea of thought processes and dynamic reasoning, where information flow is conditioned not only on the data itself, but also on the internal state of the system.
  It is important to note that this work does not aim to compete with state-of-the-art language models in terms of performance. Instead, it presents a conceptual prototype-an architectural framework that opens up a new direction for exploring adaptable and potentially more interpretable networks. The goal is not optimization of existing benchmarks but rather the proposal of a system that can learn not only representations, but also the structure of computation itself.
  Due to practical constraints in computing resources and data, this study remains a preliminary investigation. Nevertheless, initial observations show promise, and the architecture's full potential can only be evaluated in future experiments under more favorable computational conditions.

Abstract: Learning Analytics Dashboards can be a powerful tool to support self-regulated learning in Digital Learning Environments and promote development of meta-cognitive skills, such as reflection. However, their effectiveness can be affected by the interpretability of the data they provide. To assist in the interpretation, we employ a large language model to generate verbal explanations of the data in the dashboard and evaluate it against a standalone dashboard and explanations provided by human teachers in an expert study with university level educators (N=12). We find that the LLM-based explanations of the skill state presented in the dashboard, as well as general recommendations on how to proceed with learning within the course are significantly more favored compared to the other conditions. This indicates that using LLMs for interpretation purposes can enhance the learning experience for learners while maintaining the pedagogical standards approved by teachers.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of integrating complex, high-dimensional deep semantic features with simple, interpretable structural cues for lyrical content classification. We introduce a novel Synergistic Fusion Layer (SFL) architecture, a deep learning model utilizing a gated mechanism to modulate Sentence-BERT embeddings (Fdeep) using low-dimensional auxiliary features (Fstruct). The task, derived from clustering UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings, is reframed as binary classification, distinguishing a dominant, homogeneous cluster (Class 0) from all other content (Class 1). The SFL model achieved an accuracy of 0.9894 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9894, outperforming a comprehensive Random Forest (RF) baseline that used feature concatenation (Accuracy = 0.9868). Crucially, the SFL model demonstrated vastly superior reliability and calibration, exhibiting a 93% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0035) and a 2.5x lower Log Loss (0.0304) compared to the RF baseline (ECE = 0.0500; Log Loss = 0.0772). This performance validates the architectural hypothesis that non-linear gating is superior to simple feature concatenation, establishing the SFL model as a robust and trustworthy system for complex multimodal lyrical analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法能够克服传统剪枝方法的局限性，在满足硬件尺寸约束的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: As a widely adopted model compression technique, model pruning has demonstrated strong effectiveness across various architectures. However, we observe that when sparsity exceeds a certain threshold, both iterative and one-shot pruning methods lead to a steep decline in model performance. This rapid degradation limits the achievable compression ratio and prevents models from meeting the stringent size constraints required by certain hardware platforms, rendering them inoperable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy. Starting from an extremely compressed network that satisfies hardware constraints, the method selectively regenerates critical connections to recover lost performance, effectively mitigating the sharp accuracy drop commonly observed under high sparsity conditions.

Conclusion: LwP框架通过保持表示空间的几何结构，有效支持持续多任务学习，特别适用于对隐私敏感的现实动态环境。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems in critical fields like autonomous driving and medical imaging analysis often continually learn new tasks using a shared stream of input data. For instance, after learning to detect traffic signs, a model may later need to learn to classify traffic lights or different types of vehicles using the same camera feed. This scenario introduces a challenging setting we term Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where a model sequentially learns new tasks on an underlying data distribution without forgetting previously learned abilities. Existing continual learning methods often fail in this setting because they learn fragmented, task-specific features that interfere with one another. To address this, we introduce Learning with Preserving (LwP), a novel framework that shifts the focus from preserving task outputs to maintaining the geometric structure of the shared representation space. The core of LwP is a Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss that prevents representation drift by regularizing the pairwise distances between latent data representations. This mechanism of preserving the underlying geometric structure allows the model to retain implicit knowledge and support diverse tasks without requiring a replay buffer, making it suitable for privacy-conscious applications. Extensive evaluations on time-series and image benchmarks show that LwP not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Notably, our method shows superior robustness to distribution shifts and is the only approach to surpass the strong single-task learning baseline, underscoring its effectiveness for real-world dynamic environments.

Abstract: Learning to optimize (L2O) parametric approximations of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) solutions offers the potential for fast, reusable decision-making in real-time power system operations. However, the inherent nonconvexity of AC-OPF results in challenging optimization landscapes, and standard learning approaches often fail to converge to feasible, high-quality solutions. This work introduces a \textit{homotopy-guided self-supervised L2O method} for parametric AC-OPF problems. The key idea is to construct a continuous deformation of the objective and constraints during training, beginning from a relaxed problem with a broad basin of attraction and gradually transforming it toward the original problem. The resulting learning process improves convergence stability and promotes feasibility without requiring labeled optimal solutions or external solvers. We evaluate the proposed method on standard IEEE AC-OPF benchmarks and show that homotopy-guided L2O significantly increases feasibility rates compared to non-homotopy baselines, while achieving objective values comparable to full OPF solvers. These findings demonstrate the promise of homotopy-based heuristics for scalable, constraint-aware L2O in power system optimization.

Motivation: 自由边界微分同胚优化在表面映射中至关重要但极具挑战性，传统数值算法需要地标条件且无法应用于基于梯度的优化

Method: 提出谱Beltrami网络(SBN)将LSQC能量嵌入多尺度网格谱架构，然后构建SBN-Opt优化框架控制局部几何畸变

Result: 在密度均衡映射和不一致表面配准的广泛实验中，SBN-Opt优于传统数值算法

Conclusion: SBN-Opt框架成功解决了自由边界微分同胚优化问题，实现了局部几何畸变的显式控制

Abstract: Free-boundary diffeomorphism optimization is a core ingredient in the surface mapping problem but remains notoriously difficult because the boundary is unconstrained and local bijectivity must be preserved under large deformation. Numerical Least-Squares Quasiconformal (LSQC) theory, with its provable existence, uniqueness, similarity-invariance and resolution-independence, offers an elegant mathematical remedy. However, the conventional numerical algorithm requires landmark conditioning, and cannot be applied into gradient-based optimization. We propose a neural surrogate, the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), that embeds LSQC energy into a multiscale mesh-spectral architecture. Next, we propose the SBN guided optimization framework SBN-Opt which optimizes free-boundary diffeomorphism for the problem, with local geometric distortion explicitly controllable. Extensive experiments on density-equalizing maps and inconsistent surface registration demonstrate our SBN-Opt's superiority over traditional numerical algorithms.

Motivation: 野火对全球生态系统构成重大威胁，加利福尼亚由于气候、地形、植被和人类活动等因素频繁发生火灾，需要开发全面的风险评估方法。

Method: 应用随机森林算法，结合SHAP可解释AI技术解释模型预测，采用空间和时间验证策略评估模型性能。

Conclusion: RF-SHAP框架为野火风险评估提供了稳健、可理解和适应性强的方法，有助于制定有针对性的风险缓解策略。

Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant global threat to ecosystems worldwide, with California experiencing recurring fires due to various factors, including climate, topographical features, vegetation patterns, and human activities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive wildfire risk map for California by applying the random forest (RF) algorithm, augmented with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to interpret model predictions. Model performance was assessed using both spatial and temporal validation strategies. The RF model demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving near-perfect discrimination for grasslands (AUC = 0.996) and forests (AUC = 0.997). Spatial cross-validation revealed moderate transferability, yielding ROC-AUC values of 0.6155 for forests and 0.5416 for grasslands. In contrast, temporal split validation showed enhanced generalization, especially for forests (ROC-AUC = 0.6615, PR-AUC = 0.8423). SHAP-based XAI analysis identified key ecosystem-specific drivers: soil organic carbon, tree cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) emerged as the most influential in forests, whereas Land Surface Temperature (LST), elevation, and vegetation health indices were dominant in grasslands. District-level classification revealed that Central Valley and Northern Buttes districts had the highest concentration of high-risk grasslands, while Northern Buttes and North Coast Redwoods dominated forested high-risk areas. This RF-SHAP framework offers a robust, comprehensible, and adaptable method for assessing wildfire risks, enabling informed decisions and creating targeted strategies to mitigate dangers.

Abstract: Ground-based cloud image segmentation is a critical research domain for photovoltaic power forecasting. Current deep learning approaches primarily focus on encoder-decoder architectural refinements. However, existing methodologies exhibit several limitations:(1)they rely on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, lacking the partial feature effectiveness and interoperability of inter-channel;(2)attention-based feature enhancement implementations neglect accuracy-throughput balance; and (3)the decoder modifications fail to establish global interdependencies among hierarchical local features, limiting inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the encoder incorporates MPAC, which comprises:(1)a MPC block with ParCM and ParSM that enables global spatial interaction across multi-scale cloud formations, and (2)a MPA block combining ParAM and ParSM to extract discriminative features with reduced computational complexity. On the decoder side, a M2B is employed to mitigate contextual loss through a SSHD that maintains linear complexity while enabling deep feature aggregation across spatial and scale dimensions. As a key contribution to the community, we also introduce and release a dataset CSRC, which is a clear-label, fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to overcome the critical limitations of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments on CSRC demonstrate the superior performance of MPCM-Net over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. The dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/she1110/CSRC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为不同资源约束训练和部署多个ViT模型成本高且效率低，需要一种方法能够从单一预训练模型中灵活提取不同大小的子网络。

Method: WPAC使用加权PCA压缩注意力层知识到关键权重；PIAD通过渐进重要性感知dropout促进知识分层组织。

Result: WPAC在知识集中方面优于现有剪枝标准，与PIAD结合为模型压缩和扩展提供了强大的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效组织ViT中的知识分层，实现从单一超网络灵活提取不同大小的子网络，在模型压缩和扩展方面表现优异。

Abstract: Training and deploying multiple vision transformer (ViT) models for different resource constraints is costly and inefficient. To address this, we propose transforming a pre-trained ViT into a stratified knowledge-density super-network, where knowledge is hierarchically organized across weights. This enables flexible extraction of sub-networks that retain maximal knowledge for varying model sizes. We introduce \textbf{W}eighted \textbf{P}CA for \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{C}ontraction (WPAC), which concentrates knowledge into a compact set of critical weights. WPAC applies token-wise weighted principal component analysis to intermediate features and injects the resulting transformation and inverse matrices into adjacent layers, preserving the original network function while enhancing knowledge compactness. To further promote stratified knowledge organization, we propose \textbf{P}rogressive \textbf{I}mportance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}ropout (PIAD). PIAD progressively evaluates the importance of weight groups, updates an importance-aware dropout list, and trains the super-network under this dropout regime to promote knowledge stratification. Experiments demonstrate that WPAC outperforms existing pruning criteria in knowledge concentration, and the combination with PIAD offers a strong alternative to state-of-the-art model compression and model expansion methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于医疗决策漏斗结构的贝叶斯模型，解决了选择性标签和审查偏差问题，特别是在服务不足的患者群体中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗决策中的漏斗结构（如筛查-检查-活检）存在选择性审查问题，即真实结果只在流程末端揭示，这会导致风险评估偏差，特别是在结果更常被审查的服务不足患者群体中。

Method: 开发了一个贝叶斯模型来处理漏斗决策结构中的选择性标签和审查问题，借鉴了先前关于选择性标签和审查的研究工作。

Result: 在合成设置中，模型能够比基线更准确地恢复真实参数并预测被审查患者的结果。在急诊科就诊数据应用中，发现医院和ICU入院存在基于性别的差异，模型估计女性进入ICU的死亡风险阈值（5.1%）高于男性（4.5%）。

Conclusion: 该贝叶斯模型能够有效处理医疗漏斗决策结构中的选择性审查偏差，揭示了医疗服务中存在的性别差异，为改善医疗决策公平性提供了工具。

Abstract: Many sequential decision settings in healthcare feature funnel structures characterized by a series of stages, such as screenings or evaluations, where the number of patients who advance to each stage progressively decreases and decisions become increasingly costly. For example, an oncologist may first conduct a breast exam, followed by a mammogram for patients with concerning exams, followed by a biopsy for patients with concerning mammograms. A key challenge is that the ground truth outcome, such as the biopsy result, is only revealed at the end of this funnel. The selective censoring of the ground truth can introduce statistical biases in risk estimation, especially in underserved patient groups, whose outcomes are more frequently censored. We develop a Bayesian model for funnel decision structures, drawing from prior work on selective labels and censoring. We first show in synthetic settings that our model is able to recover the true parameters and predict outcomes for censored patients more accurately than baselines. We then apply our model to a dataset of emergency department visits, where in-hospital mortality is observed only for those who are admitted to either the hospital or ICU. We find that there are gender-based differences in hospital and ICU admissions. In particular, our model estimates that the mortality risk threshold to admit women to the ICU is higher for women (5.1%) than for men (4.5%).

Motivation: 预训练模型在时间序列预测中表现出色，但适应不断变化的数据分布面临挑战，主要障碍在于无法访问原始训练数据，仅对新数据进行微调会导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: R-Tuning构建统一潜在空间，通过基于小波分解的频率感知回放策略生成趋势保持和融合增强的变体，提高表示多样性和回放效率，并引入潜在一致性约束对齐新旧表示。

Result: 实验结果显示R-Tuning在新任务上MAE和MSE分别降低高达46.9%和46.8%，同时在旧任务上保持知识增益达5.7%和6.0%。在少样本设置下，即使合成代理样本仅占新任务数据集的5%，仍优于所有最先进基线。

Conclusion: R-Tuning通过频率感知回放和潜在一致性约束有效解决了预训练时间序列模型的持续适应问题，在保持先验知识的同时显著提升新任务性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained models have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in time-series forecasting; however, adapting them to evolving data distributions remains a significant challenge. A key hurdle lies in accessing the original training data, as fine-tuning solely on new data often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose Replay Tuning (R-Tuning), a novel framework designed for the continual adaptation of pre-trained time-series models. R-Tuning constructs a unified latent space that captures both prior and current task knowledge through a frequency-aware replay strategy. Specifically, it augments model-generated samples via wavelet-based decomposition across multiple frequency bands, generating trend-preserving and fusion-enhanced variants to improve representation diversity and replay efficiency. To further reduce reliance on synthetic samples, R-Tuning introduces a latent consistency constraint that aligns new representations with the prior task space. This constraint guides joint optimization within a compact and semantically coherent latent space, ensuring robust knowledge retention and adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R-Tuning, which reduces MAE and MSE by up to 46.9% and 46.8%, respectively, on new tasks, while preserving prior knowledge with gains of up to 5.7% and 6.0% on old tasks. Notably, under few-shot settings, R-Tuning outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines even when synthetic proxy samples account for only 5% of the new task dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在逆问题中的两个关键挑战：1) 失真-感知权衡，即提高感知质量会降低重建保真度；2) 曝光偏差问题，训练-推理输入不匹配导致预测误差累积和重建质量下降。

Method: 提出正则化Schrödinger Bridge (RSB)，采用新颖的正则化训练策略，扰动输入状态和目标，通过暴露模型于模拟预测误差来缓解曝光偏差，并通过后验均值的精心设计插值来减轻失真。

Result: 在语音增强的两个典型逆问题上进行广泛实验，RSB优于最先进方法，显著改善失真指标并有效减少曝光偏差。

Conclusion: RSB是针对逆问题定制的Schrödinger Bridge改进版本，成功解决了失真-感知权衡和曝光偏差问题，在语音增强任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Diffusion models serve as a powerful generative framework for solving inverse problems. However, they still face two key challenges: 1) the distortion-perception tradeoff, where improving perceptual quality often degrades reconstruction fidelity, and 2) the exposure bias problem, where the training-inference input mismatch leads to prediction error accumulation and reduced reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose the Regularized Schrödinger Bridge (RSB), an adaptation of Schrödinger Bridge tailored for inverse problems that addresses the above limitations. RSB employs a novel regularized training strategy that perturbs both the input states and targets, effectively mitigating exposure bias by exposing the model to simulated prediction errors and also alleviating distortion by well-designed interpolation via the posterior mean. Extensive experiments on two typical inverse problems for speech enhancement demonstrate that RSB outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving distortion metrics and effectively reducing exposure bias.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型采样方法在低NFE（函数评估次数）下难以同时满足有效性、适应性、实用鲁棒性和计算效率四个核心原则，需要更先进的解决方案。

Method: 提出分层调度优化器（HSO），采用双层优化框架：上层全局搜索最优初始化策略，下层局部优化调度细化，使用中点误差代理（MEP）和间距惩罚适应度（SPF）函数进行指导。

Result: 在极低NFE（如5次）下，HSO在LAION-Aesthetics数据集上达到11.94的FID分数，优化成本仅需不到8秒。

Conclusion: HSO提供了一种高效实用的扩散模型加速范式，无需重新训练即可在极低计算成本下实现卓越的采样质量。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have set a new standard for generative fidelity but are hindered by a slow iterative sampling process. A powerful training-free strategy to accelerate this process is Schedule Optimization, which aims to find an optimal distribution of timesteps for a fixed and small Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to maximize sample quality. To this end, a successful schedule optimization method must adhere to four core principles: effectiveness, adaptivity, practical robustness, and computational efficiency. However, existing paradigms struggle to satisfy these principles simultaneously, motivating the need for a more advanced solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical-Schedule-Optimizer (HSO), a novel and efficient bi-level optimization framework. HSO reframes the search for a globally optimal schedule into a more tractable problem by iteratively alternating between two synergistic levels: an upper-level global search for an optimal initialization strategy and a lower-level local optimization for schedule refinement. This process is guided by two key innovations: the Midpoint Error Proxy (MEP), a solver-agnostic and numerically stable objective for effective local optimization, and the Spacing-Penalized Fitness (SPF) function, which ensures practical robustness by penalizing pathologically close timesteps. Extensive experiments show that HSO sets a new state-of-the-art for training-free sampling in the extremely low-NFE regime. For instance, with an NFE of just 5, HSO achieves a remarkable FID of 11.94 on LAION-Aesthetics with Stable Diffusion v2.1. Crucially, this level of performance is attained not through costly retraining, but with a one-time optimization cost of less than 8 seconds, presenting a highly practical and efficient paradigm for diffusion model acceleration.

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning for vision-language models has demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities under zero-shot settings. However, tuning the learnable prompts solely based on unlabeled test data may induce prompt optimization bias, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we analyze the underlying causes of prompt optimization bias from both the model and data perspectives. In terms of the model, the entropy minimization objective typically focuses on reducing the entropy of model predictions while overlooking their correctness. This can result in overconfident yet incorrect outputs, thereby compromising the quality of prompt optimization. On the data side, prompts affected by optimization bias can introduce misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which further aggravates the prompt optimization bias. To this end, we propose a Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning method. Specifically, we first introduce a dynamic retrieval-augmented modulation module that retrieves high-confidence knowledge from a dynamic knowledge base using the test image feature as a query, and uses the retrieved knowledge to modulate the predictions. Guided by the refined predictions, we further develop a reliability-aware prompt optimization module that incorporates a confidence-based weighted ensemble and cross-modal consistency distillation to impose regularization constraints during prompt tuning. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmark datasets involving both natural distribution shifts and cross-datasets generalization demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, validating its effectiveness in mitigating prompt optimization bias.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is critical for building transparent, trustworthy models. Current saliency-based methods, adapted from vision, highlight spectrogram regions but fail to show whether these regions correspond to meaningful acoustic markers of emotion, limiting faithfulness and interpretability. We propose a framework that overcomes these limitations by quantifying the magnitudes of cues within salient regions. This clarifies "what" is highlighted and connects it to "why" it matters, linking saliency to expert-referenced acoustic cues of speech emotions. Experiments on benchmark SER datasets show that our approach improves explanation quality by explicitly linking salient regions to theory-driven speech emotions expert-referenced acoustics. Compared to standard saliency methods, it provides more understandable and plausible explanations of SER models, offering a foundational step towards trustworthy speech-based affective computing.

Motivation: 传统基于优化的文本到3D方法将2D生成模型的指导视为静态，忽略了源动态性，导致不一致的轨迹和语义线索的抑制或合并，产生"语义过平滑"伪影。

Method: 将问题重新表述为双条件潜空间，同时以文本提示和中间渲染图像为条件。提出AnchorDS机制，提供基于图像条件的状态锚定指导，并设计了轻量级过滤策略和微调策略来优化锚点。

Conclusion: 通过考虑源动态性并引入图像条件锚定，AnchorDS显著改善了文本到3D生成的稳定性和语义一致性，为复杂场景的3D生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization-based text-to-3D methods distill guidance from 2D generative models via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), but implicitly treat this guidance as static. This work shows that ignoring source dynamics yields inconsistent trajectories that suppress or merge semantic cues, leading to "semantic over-smoothing" artifacts. As such, we reformulate text-to-3D optimization as mapping a dynamically evolving source distribution to a fixed target distribution. We cast the problem into a dual-conditioned latent space, conditioned on both the text prompt and the intermediately rendered image. Given this joint setup, we observe that the image condition naturally anchors the current source distribution. Building on this insight, we introduce AnchorDS, an improved score distillation mechanism that provides state-anchored guidance with image conditions and stabilizes generation. We further penalize erroneous source estimates and design a lightweight filter strategy and fine-tuning strategy that refines the anchor with negligible overhead. AnchorDS produces finer-grained detail, more natural colours, and stronger semantic consistency, particularly for complex prompts, while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method surpasses previous methods in both quality and efficiency.

Abstract: This position paper envisions a next-generation elderly monitoring system that moves beyond fall detection toward the broader goal of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recognition. Our ultimate aim is to design privacy-preserving, edge-deployed, and federated AI systems that can robustly detect and understand daily routines, supporting independence and dignity in aging societies. At present, ADL-specific datasets are still under collection. As a preliminary step, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments using the SISFall dataset and its GAN-augmented variants, treating fall detection as a proxy task. We report initial results on federated learning with non-IID conditions, and embedded deployment on Jetson Orin Nano devices. We then outline open challenges such as domain shift, data scarcity, and privacy risks, and propose directions toward full ADL monitoring in smart-room environments. This work highlights the transition from single-task detection to comprehensive daily activity recognition, providing both early evidence and a roadmap for sustainable and human-centered elderly care AI.

Motivation: 现有材料预测模型在分布外场景下的可靠性和不确定性量化能力缺乏系统评估，需要统一的基准框架来指导模型选择。

Method: 使用六种材料数据集构建1,375个OOD预测任务，采用五种OOD分割策略和新提出的SOAP-LOCO策略，评估12种GNN模型，结合蒙特卡洛Dropout和深度证据回归进行不确定性感知训练。

Result: 不确定性感知训练平均减少70.6%的预测误差；D-EviU与预测误差相关性最强；不同模型在不同材料属性上表现各异，没有单一最优模型。

Conclusion: MatUQ为材料发现中的分布偏移场景提供了实用的模型选择指导，不确定性感知训练显著提升预测可靠性。

Abstract: We present MatUQ, a benchmark framework for evaluating graph neural networks (GNNs) on out-of-distribution (OOD) materials property prediction with uncertainty quantification (UQ). MatUQ comprises 1,375 OOD prediction tasks constructed from six materials datasets using five OFM-based and a newly proposed structure-aware splitting strategy, SOAP-LOCO, which captures local atomic environments more effectively. We evaluate 12 representative GNN models under a unified uncertainty-aware training protocol that combines Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Evidential Regression (DER), and introduce a novel uncertainty metric, D-EviU, which shows the strongest correlation with prediction errors in most tasks. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, the uncertainty-aware training approach significantly improves model prediction accuracy, reducing errors by an average of 70.6\% across challenging OOD scenarios. Second, the benchmark reveals that no single model dominates universally: earlier models such as SchNet and ALIGNN remain competitive, while newer models like CrystalFramer and SODNet demonstrate superior performance on specific material properties. These results provide practical insights for selecting reliable models under distribution shifts in materials discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Moirai 2.0是一个基于解码器架构的时间序列基础模型，采用分位数预测和多令牌预测，在精度和推理效率方面均有提升，相比Moirai 1.0实现了更快的速度和更小的模型尺寸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进时间序列预测模型的精度和效率，简化模型架构，实现更好的精度-速度-模型尺寸权衡。

Method: 采用解码器架构、分位数预测和多令牌预测，替换了之前的掩码编码器训练、多补丁输入和混合分布输出。

Result: 在Gift-Eval基准测试中排名前列，比Moirai 1.0-Large快两倍、小三十倍且性能更好，在领域级别结果稳健。

Conclusion: 解码器架构和递归多分位数解码是性能提升的主要因素，模型性能随参数增加而趋于平稳，在较长预测范围内下降，未来需要在数据扩展和长范围建模方面继续研究。

Abstract: We introduce Moirai 2.0, a decoder-only time-series foundation model trained on a new corpus of 36M series. The model adopts quantile forecasting and multi-token prediction, improving both probabilistic accuracy and inference efficiency. On the Gift-Eval benchmark, it ranks among the top pretrained models while achieving a strong trade-off between accuracy, speed, and model size. Compared to Moirai 1.0, Moirai 2.0 replaces masked-encoder training, multi-patch inputs, and mixture-distribution outputs with a simpler decoder-only architecture, single patch, and quantile loss. Ablation studies isolate these changes -- showing that the decoder-only backbone along with recursive multi-quantile decoding contribute most to the gains. Additional experiments show that Moirai 2.0 outperforms larger models from the same family and exhibits robust domain-level results. In terms of efficiency and model size, Moirai 2.0 is twice as fast and thirty times smaller than its prior best version, Moirai 1.0-Large, while also performing better. Model performance plateaus with increasing parameter count and declines at longer horizons, motivating future work on data scaling and long-horizon modeling. We release code and evaluation details to support further research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的RNN鲁棒性验证方法DeepPrism，通过截断矩形棱柱来紧密包围Hadamard积生成的三维非线性曲面，相比现有方法在图像分类、语音识别和情感分析等任务中显著提升了验证精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RNN鲁棒性验证方法通过对非线性激活函数进行线性约束的过近似，但现有方法单独使用线性边界平面对非线性部分进行过近似，可能导致显著的过估计和较低的验证精度。

Method: 提出了一种截断矩形棱柱方法，由两个线性松弛平面构成，并通过细化驱动的方法最小化其体积和表面积，以实现更紧密的过近似。基于此方法实现了原型系统DeepPrism。

Conclusion: 所提出的DeepPrism方法通过更紧密的过近似技术，在RNN鲁棒性验证方面取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Robustness verification is a promising technique for rigorously proving Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) robustly. A key challenge is to over-approximate the nonlinear activation functions with linear constraints, which can transform the verification problem into an efficiently solvable linear programming problem. Existing methods over-approximate the nonlinear parts with linear bounding planes individually, which may cause significant over-estimation and lead to lower verification accuracy. In this paper, in order to tightly enclose the three-dimensional nonlinear surface generated by the Hadamard product, we propose a novel truncated rectangular prism formed by two linear relaxation planes and a refinement-driven method to minimize both its volume and surface area for tighter over-approximation. Based on this approximation, we implement a prototype DeepPrism for RNN robustness verification. The experimental results demonstrate that \emph{DeepPrism} has significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in various tasks of image classification, speech recognition and sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: 该工作为在能源市场预测中利用概率性神经网络模型提供了参考。

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting is critical for strategic decision-making in deregulated electricity markets, where volatility stems from complex supply-demand dynamics and external factors. Traditional point forecasts often fail to capture inherent uncertainties, limiting their utility for risk management. This work presents a framework for probabilistic electricity price forecasting using Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, training separate models for each hour of the day to capture diurnal patterns. A critical assessment and comparison with the benchmark model, namely: generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity with exogenous variable (GARCHX) model and the LASSO estimated auto-regressive model (LEAR), highlights that the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models in terms of point prediction and intervals. This work serves as a reference for leveraging probabilistic neural models in energy market predictions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种基于语义分割的输入表示方法（SS-only和RGB+SS），用于解决3D环境中强化学习的高内存消耗和部分可观测性问题，在ViZDoom死亡竞赛中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D环境中强化学习面临的两个主要挑战：(1) 稳定学习所需内存缓冲区的高内存消耗；(2) 部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(POMDPs)的学习复杂性。

Method: 提出两种新颖的输入表示：SS-only（仅语义分割）和RGB+SS（RGB+语义分割），在ViZDoom死亡竞赛中使用完美分割结果进行受控评估，并探索基于密度的热图可视化方法。

Result: SS-only能够将内存缓冲区内存消耗减少至少66.6%，应用游程编码等无损压缩技术时最高可达98.6%；RGB+SS通过额外的语义信息显著提升了RL智能体性能。

Conclusion: 语义分割输入表示有效解决了3D环境中强化学习的内存消耗和性能问题，密度热图为评估智能体运动模式提供了可视化工具，克服了在ViZDoom等3D环境中应用语义分割的常见缺陷。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in 3D environments with high-dimensional sensory input poses two major challenges: (1) the high memory consumption induced by memory buffers required to stabilise learning, and (2) the complexity of learning in partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). This project addresses these challenges by proposing two novel input representations: SS-only and RGB+SS, both employing semantic segmentation on RGB colour images. Experiments were conducted in deathmatches of ViZDoom, utilizing perfect segmentation results for controlled evaluation. Our results showed that SS-only was able to reduce the memory consumption of memory buffers by at least 66.6%, and up to 98.6% when a vectorisable lossless compression technique with minimal overhead such as run-length encoding is applied. Meanwhile, RGB+SS significantly enhances RL agents' performance with the additional semantic information provided. Furthermore, we explored density-based heatmapping as a tool to visualise RL agents' movement patterns and evaluate their suitability for data collection. A brief comparison with a previous approach highlights how our method overcame common pitfalls in applying semantic segmentation in 3D environments like ViZDoom.

Conclusion: 该框架为需要不同空间和时间分辨率的环境应用提供了一个灵活、分析就绪的表示学习方法，能够捕捉互补的遥感数据并保持跨时空的一致性。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) foundation models have emerged as an effective approach to derive latent representations of the Earth system from various remote sensing sensors. These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出FSC-Net双网络架构，通过快慢分离机制缓解持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在Split-MNIST和Split-CIFAR-10上分别取得91.71%和33.31%的保留准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受神经科学中记忆巩固机制启发，解决神经网络在持续学习中因灾难性遗忘而丢失先前知识的问题。

Method: 采用双网络架构：快速网络(NN1)负责新任务快速适应，慢速网络(NN2)通过蒸馏和重放进行知识巩固。发现纯重放优于蒸馏方法。

Result: 在Split-MNIST上保留准确率达91.71%±0.62%，比单快网络提升4.27pp；在Split-CIFAR-10上达33.31%±0.38%，提升8.20pp。简单MLP架构优于复杂变体。

Conclusion: 双时间尺度巩固机制而非架构复杂性是缓解灾难性遗忘的关键，但绝对性能仍有提升空间，需要更强骨干网络。

Abstract: Continual learning remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting, where neural networks lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in neuroscience, we propose FSC-Net (Fast-Slow Consolidation Networks), a dual-network architecture that separates rapid task learning from gradual knowledge consolidation. Our method employs a fast network (NN1) for immediate adaptation to new tasks and a slow network (NN2) that consolidates knowledge through distillation and replay. Within the family of MLP-based NN1 variants we evaluated, consolidation effectiveness is driven more by methodology than architectural embellishments -- a simple MLP outperforms more complex similarity-gated variants by 1.2pp. Through systematic hyperparameter analysis, we observed empirically that pure replay without distillation during consolidation achieves superior performance, consistent with the hypothesis that distillation from the fast network introduces recency bias. On Split-MNIST (30 seeds), FSC-Net achieves 91.71% +/- 0.62% retention accuracy, a +4.27pp gain over the fast network alone (87.43% +/- 1.27%, paired t=23.585, p < 1e-10). On Split-CIFAR-10 (5 seeds), our method achieves 33.31% +/- 0.38% retention with an +8.20pp gain over the fast network alone (25.11% +/- 1.61%, paired t=9.75, p < 1e-3), demonstrating +8.20pp gain, though absolute performance (33.31%) remains modest and below random expectation, highlighting need for stronger backbones. Our results provide empirical evidence that the dual-timescale consolidation mechanism, rather than architectural complexity, is central to mitigating catastrophic forgetting in this setting.

*Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将Model-X knockoffs方法应用于稀疏自编码器(SAE)特征选择，通过knockoff+控制错误发现率(FDR)，在Pythia-70M模型的情感分类任务中识别出129个相关特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在识别神经网络可解释特征时面临挑战，难以区分真实计算模式和错误相关性，需要更可靠的特征选择方法。

Method: 使用Model-X knockoffs方法，通过高斯替代模型处理潜在分布，结合knockoff+控制FDR，对512个高活性SAE潜在特征进行选择。

Result: 在目标FDR q=0.1下选择了129个特征，约25%的潜在特征携带任务相关信号，75%不相关，所选特征与非选特征在knockoff统计量上显示5.40倍分离。

Conclusion: 该方法为可靠特征发现提供了可重复且原则性的框架，结合SAE和多重测试感知推理，推进了机制可解释性的基础。

Abstract: Although sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are crucial for identifying interpretable features in neural networks, it is still challenging to distinguish between real computational patterns and erroneous correlations. We introduce Model-X knockoffs to SAE feature selection, using knock-off+ to control the false discovery rate (FDR) with finite-sample guarantees under the standard Model-X assumptions (in our case, via a Gaussian surrogate for the latent distribution). We select 129 features at a target FDR q=0.1 after analyzing 512 high-activity SAE latents for sentiment classification using Pythia-70M. About 25% of the latents under examination carry task-relevant signal, whereas 75% do not, according to the chosen set, which displays a 5.40x separation in knockoff statistics compared to non-selected features. Our method offers a re-producible and principled framework for reliable feature discovery by combining SAEs with multiple-testing-aware inference, advancing the foundations of mechanistic interpretability.

Conclusion: 推理需要特定的架构支持，而不仅仅是模式匹配，OpenLM展示了通过状态空间中的迭代算子应用可以实现真正的推理能力。

Abstract: What is reasoning? This question has driven centuries of philosophical inquiry, from Aristotle's syllogisms to modern computational complexity theory. In the age of large language models achieving superhuman performance on benchmarks like GSM8K (95\% accuracy) and HumanEval (90\% pass@1), we must ask: have these systems learned to \emph{reason}, or have they learned to \emph{pattern-match over reasoning traces}?
  This paper argues for a specific answer: \textbf{reasoning is iterative operator application in state spaces, converging to fixed points}. This definition is not merely philosophical -- it has concrete architectural implications that explain both the failures of current systems and the path to genuine reasoning capabilities.
  Our investigation begins with a puzzle (OpenXOR), progresses through theory (OpenOperator), and culminates in a working solution (OpenLM) that achieves 76\% accuracy where state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 0\%. This is not about criticizing existing systems, but about \emph{understanding what reasoning requires} and \emph{building architectures that provide it}.

Conclusion: 联邦学习能够在保护数据隐私的前提下，实现跨医院的高性能肺炎检测模型训练，特别适用于罕见疾病和低数据领域，为加速诊断和治疗开发提供突破性方案。

Abstract: Early and accurate pneumonia detection from chest X-rays (CXRs) is clinically critical to expedite treatment and isolation, reduce complications, and curb unnecessary antibiotic use. Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.
  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR. These results indicate that FL delivers high-performing, generalizable, secure and private pneumonia detection across healthcare networks, with data kept local. This is especially relevant for rare diseases, where FL enables secure multi-institutional collaboration without data movement, representing a breakthrough for accelerating diagnosis and treatment development in low-data domains.

Conclusion: Grassmann流形为单细胞数据分析提供了连贯且信息丰富的基础。

Abstract: Single-cell data analysis seeks to characterize cellular heterogeneity based on high-dimensional gene expression profiles. Conventional approaches represent each cell as a vector in Euclidean space, which limits their ability to capture intrinsic correlations and multiscale geometric structures. We propose a multiscale framework based on Grassmann manifolds that integrates machine learning with subspace geometry for single-cell data analysis. By generating embeddings under multiple representation scales, the framework combines their features from different geometric views into a unified Grassmann manifold. A power-based scale sampling function is introduced to control the selection of scales and balance in- formation across resolutions. Experiments on nine benchmark single-cell RNA-seq datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively preserves meaningful structures and provides stable clustering performance, particularly for small to medium-sized datasets. These results suggest that Grassmann manifolds offer a coherent and informative foundation for analyzing single cell data.

Abstract: Reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers by enabling real-time temperature prediction is critical for sustainability and operational efficiency. Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours). This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\%) and reduced carbon footprint.

Method: 通过理论分析和实验观察，研究去噪分数匹配优化条件输入时产生的偏置问题。

Result: 发现这种优化破坏了去噪分数匹配与精确分数匹配的等价性，导致更高的分数范数，并在数据分布优化中也观察到类似偏置。

Conclusion: 这种偏置影响了多个领域的研究，包括自回归生成的MAR、图像压缩的PerCo和文本到3D生成的DreamFusion等。

Abstract: Many recent works utilize denoising score matching to optimize the conditional input of diffusion models. In this workshop paper, we demonstrate that such optimization breaks the equivalence between denoising score matching and exact score matching. Furthermore, we show that this bias leads to higher score norm. Additionally, we observe a similar bias when optimizing the data distribution using a pre-trained diffusion model. Finally, we discuss the wide range of works across different domains that are affected by this bias, including MAR for auto-regressive generation, PerCo for image compression, and DreamFusion for text to 3D generation.

Abstract: Neural differential equations offer a powerful framework for modeling continuous-time dynamics, but forecasting stiff biophysical systems remains unreliable. Standard Neural ODEs and physics informed variants often require orders of magnitude more iterations, and even then may converge to suboptimal solutions that fail to preserve oscillatory frequency or amplitude. We introduce PhysicsInformed Neural ODEs with with Scale-Aware Residuals (PI-NODE-SR), a framework that combines a low-order explicit solver (Heun method) residual normalisation to balance contributions between state variables evolving on disparate timescales. This combination stabilises training under realistic iteration budgets and avoids reliance on computationally expensive implicit solvers. On the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, PI-NODE-SR learns from a single oscillation simulated with a stiff solver (Rodas5P) and extrapolates beyond 100 ms, capturing both oscillation frequency and near-correct amplitudes. Remarkably, end-to-end learning of the vector field enables PI-NODE-SR to recover morphological features such as sharp subthreshold curvature in gating variables that are typically reserved for higher-order solvers, suggesting that neural correction can offset numerical diffusion. While performance remains sensitive to initialisation, PI-NODE-SR consistently reduces long-horizon errors relative to baseline Neural-ODEs and PINNs, offering a principled route to stable and efficient learning of stiff biological dynamics.

TL;DR: DK-Root是一个联合数据和知识驱动的框架，通过对比表示学习和条件扩散模型，结合规则标签和专家标注，实现移动网络QoE问题的鲁棒根因分析。

Motivation: 解决移动网络中QoE问题根因诊断的挑战：跨层KPI交互复杂、专家标注稀缺，而基于规则的标签虽然可扩展但噪声大且粒度粗。

Method: 1) 使用对比表示学习预训练编码器，通过监督对比目标对规则标签去噪；2) 引入类条件扩散模型生成保留根因语义的KPI序列，提供弱/强数据增强；3) 使用稀缺专家标注联合微调编码器和轻量分类器。

Conclusion: DK-Root通过统一可扩展的弱监督和精确的专家指导，实现了鲁棒的根因分析，在表示质量和分类性能上均获得显著提升。

Abstract: Diagnosing the root causes of Quality of Experience (QoE) degradations in operational mobile networks is challenging due to complex cross-layer interactions among kernel performance indicators (KPIs) and the scarcity of reliable expert annotations. Although rule-based heuristics can generate labels at scale, they are noisy and coarse-grained, limiting the accuracy of purely data-driven approaches. To address this, we propose DK-Root, a joint data-and-knowledge-driven framework that unifies scalable weak supervision with precise expert guidance for robust root-cause analysis. DK-Root first pretrains an encoder via contrastive representation learning using abundant rule-based labels while explicitly denoising their noise through a supervised contrastive objective. To supply task-faithful data augmentation, we introduce a class-conditional diffusion model that generates KPIs sequences preserving root-cause semantics, and by controlling reverse diffusion steps, it produces weak and strong augmentations that improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the encoder and the lightweight classifier are jointly fine-tuned with scarce expert-verified labels to sharpen decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on a real-world, operator-grade dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, with DK-Root surpassing traditional ML and recent semi-supervised time-series methods. Ablations confirm the necessity of the conditional diffusion augmentation and the pretrain-finetune design, validating both representation quality and classification gains.

Method: 采用好奇心驱动的量化混合专家框架，使用贝叶斯认知不确定性路由在异构专家（BitNet三元、1-16位BitLinear、训练后量化）间分配任务。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices faces two critical challenges: maintaining accuracy under aggressive quantization while ensuring predictable inference latency. We present a curiosity-driven quantized Mixture-of-Experts framework that addresses both through Bayesian epistemic uncertainty-based routing across heterogeneous experts (BitNet ternary, 1-16 bit BitLinear, post-training quantization). Evaluated on audio classification benchmarks (ESC-50, Quinn, UrbanSound8K), our 4-bit quantization maintains 99.9 percent of 16-bit accuracy (0.858 vs 0.859 F1) with 4x compression and 41 percent energy savings versus 8-bit. Crucially, curiosity-driven routing reduces MoE latency variance by 82 percent (p = 0.008, Levene's test) from 230 ms to 29 ms standard deviation, enabling stable inference for battery-constrained devices. Statistical analysis confirms 4-bit/8-bit achieve practical equivalence with full precision (p > 0.05), while MoE architectures introduce 11 percent latency overhead (p < 0.001) without accuracy gains. At scale, deployment emissions dominate training by 10000x for models serving more than 1,000 inferences, making inference efficiency critical. Our information-theoretic routing demonstrates that adaptive quantization yields accurate (0.858 F1, 1.2M params), energy-efficient (3.87 F1/mJ), and predictable edge models, with simple 4-bit quantized architectures outperforming complex MoE for most deployments.

Abstract: We present a concise, self-contained derivation of diffusion-based generative models. Starting from basic properties of Gaussian distributions (densities, quadratic expectations, re-parameterisation, products, and KL divergences), we construct denoising diffusion probabilistic models from first principles. This includes the forward noising process, its closed-form marginals, the exact discrete reverse posterior, and the related variational bound. This bound simplifies to the standard noise-prediction goal used in practice. We then discuss likelihood estimation and accelerated sampling, covering DDIM, adversarially learned reverse dynamics (DDGAN), and multi-scale variants such as nested and latent diffusion, with Stable Diffusion as a canonical example. A continuous-time formulation follows, in which we derive the probability-flow ODE from the diffusion SDE via the continuity and Fokker-Planck equations, introduce flow matching, and show how rectified flows recover DDIM up to a time re-parameterisation. Finally, we treat guided diffusion, interpreting classifier guidance as a posterior score correction and classifier-free guidance as a principled interpolation between conditional and unconditional scores. Throughout, the focus is on transparent algebra, explicit intermediate steps, and consistent notation, so that readers can both follow the theory and implement the corresponding algorithms in practice.

Abstract: Tropical Cyclone (TC) estimation aims to accurately estimate various TC attributes in real time. However, distribution shifts arising from the complex and dynamic nature of TC environmental fields, such as varying geographical conditions and seasonal changes, present significant challenges to reliable estimation. Most existing methods rely on multi-modal fusion for feature extraction but overlook the intrinsic distribution of feature representations, leading to poor generalization under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this, we propose an effective Identity Distribution-Oriented Physical Invariant Learning framework (IDOL), which imposes identity-oriented constraints to regulate the feature space under the guidance of prior physical knowledge, thereby dealing distribution variability with physical invariance. Specifically, the proposed IDOL employs the wind field model and dark correlation knowledge of TC to model task-shared and task-specific identity tokens. These tokens capture task dependencies and intrinsic physical invariances of TC, enabling robust estimation of TC wind speed, pressure, inner-core, and outer-core size under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed IDOL, verifying that imposing identity-oriented constraints based on prior physical knowledge can effectively mitigates diverse distribution shifts in TC estimation.Code is available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/IDOL.

Abstract: Systematic logistics, conveyance amenities and facilities as well as warehousing information play a key role in fostering profitable development in a supply chain. The aim of transformation in industries is the improvement of the resiliency regarding the supply chain. The resiliency policies are required for companies to affect the collaboration with logistics service providers positively.

The management of shipment type is a significant factor in analyzing the sustainability of logistics and supply chain. An automatic approach to predict the shipment type, logistics delay and traffic status are required to improve the efficiency of the supply chain management. A hybrid graphsage network (H-GSN) is proposed in this paper for multi-task purpose of logistics management in a supply chain. The shipment type, shipment status, traffic status, logistics ID and logistics delay are the objectives in this article regarding three different databases including DataCo, Shipping and Smart Logistcis available on Kaggle as supply chain logistics databases. The average accuracy of 97.8% and 100% are acquired for 10 kinds of logistics ID and 3 types of traffic status prediction in Smart Logistics dataset. The average accuracy of 98.7% and 99.4% are obtained for shipment type prediction in DataCo and logistics delay in Shipping database, respectively. The evaluation metrics for different logistics scenarios confirm the efficiency of the proposed method to improve the resilience and sustainability of the supply chain.

Abstract: We introduce the Sumudu Neural Operator (SNO), a neural operator rooted in the properties of the Sumudu Transform. We leverage the relationship between the polynomial expansions of transform pairs to decompose the input space as coefficients, which are then transformed into the Sumudu Space, where the neural operator is parameterized. We evaluate the operator in ODEs (Duffing Oscillator, Lorenz System, and Driven Pendulum) and PDEs (Euler-Bernoulli Beam, Burger's Equation, Diffusion, Diffusion-Reaction, and Brusselator). SNO achieves superior performance to FNO on PDEs and demonstrates competitive accuracy with LNO on several PDE tasks, including the lowest error on the Euler-Bernoulli Beam and Diffusion Equation. Additionally, we apply zero-shot super-resolution to the PDE tasks to observe the model's capability of obtaining higher quality data from low-quality samples. These preliminary findings suggest promise for the Sumudu Transform as a neural operator design, particularly for certain classes of PDEs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in fairness-aware machine learning, predictive models often exhibit discriminatory behavior towards marginalized groups. Such unfairness might arise from biased training data, model design, or representational disparities across groups, posing significant challenges in high-stakes decision-making domains such as college admissions. While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. In this paper, we try to circumvent these issues by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach enables a balance between fairness and accuracy. To further facilitate this balance, we propose an adaptive penalty update mechanism that dynamically adjusts fairness constraints during the model training. We conduct numerical experiments on two real-world college admissions datasets, across three different optimization strategies. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of KANs by consistently outperforming the baseline fair learning models, and maintaining high predictive accuracy while achieving competitive fairness across sensitive attributes.

Motivation: 现实联邦学习场景中客户端往往缺乏标签数据，而现有的半监督联邦学习方法在标签数据减少时性能显著下降。

Method: 提出客户端感知的自适应阈值（考虑类别难度）、混合阈值提升伪标签质量，并利用未伪标签数据进行一致性正则化。

Result: 在多种数据集和配置下的实验表明，CATCHFed能有效利用未标记的客户端数据，在极有限标签设置下仍能获得优越性能。

Conclusion: CATCHFed通过创新的阈值设计和数据利用策略，成功解决了半监督联邦学习在标签稀缺场景下的性能挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes distributed client resources while preserving data privacy. Most existing FL approaches assume clients possess labeled data, however, in real-world scenarios, client-side labels are often unavailable. Semi-supervised Federated learning, where only the server holds labeled data, addresses this issue. However, it experiences significant performance degradation as the number of labeled data decreases. To tackle this problem, we propose \textit{CATCHFed}, which introduces client-aware adaptive thresholds considering class difficulty, hybrid thresholds to enhance pseudo-label quality, and utilizes unpseudo-labeled data for consistency regularization. Extensive experiments across various datasets and configurations demonstrate that CATCHFed effectively leverages unlabeled client data, achieving superior performance even in extremely limited-label settings.

Conclusion: 提出的离散优化方法相比现有方法能更有效地减少ReLU数量，同时保持网络精度，在私有推理中具有显著优势。

Abstract: ReLU activations are the main bottleneck in Private Inference that is based on ResNet networks. This is because they incur significant inference latency. Reducing ReLU count is a discrete optimization problem, and there are two common ways to approach it. Most current state-of-the-art methods are based on a smooth approximation that jointly optimizes network accuracy and ReLU budget at once. However, the last hard thresholding step of the optimization usually introduces a large performance loss. We take an alternative approach that works directly in the discrete domain by leveraging Coordinate Descent as our optimization framework. In contrast to previous methods, this yields a sparse solution by design. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments, that our method is State of the Art on common benchmarks.

Conclusion: 拓扑维度理论为分析机器学习中的列表可复制性提供了有力的数学框架，建立了维度理论与学习理论之间的深刻联系。

Abstract: Dimension theory is a branch of topology concerned with defining and analyzing dimensions of geometric and topological spaces in purely topological terms. In this work, we adapt the classical notion of topological dimension (Lebesgue covering) to binary concept classes. The topological space naturally associated with a concept class is its space of realizable distributions. The loss function and the class itself induce a simplicial structure on this space, with respect to which we define a simplicial covering dimension.
  We prove that for finite concept classes, this simplicial covering dimension exactly characterizes the list replicability number (equivalently, global stability) in PAC learning. This connection allows us to apply tools from classical dimension theory to compute the exact list replicability number of the broad family of extremal concept classes.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have recently made tremendous progress towards solving challenging AI problems, they have done so at increasingly steep computational and API costs. We propose a novel strategy where we combine multiple LLM models with varying cost/accuracy tradeoffs in an agentic manner, where models and tools are run in sequence as determined by an orchestration model to minimize cost subject to a user-specified level of reliability; this constraint is formalized using conformal prediction to provide guarantees. To solve this problem, we propose Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a training paradigm that integrates constrained policy optimization with off-policy reinforcement learning and recent advances in online conformal prediction. CCPO jointly optimizes a cost-aware policy (score function) and an adaptive threshold. Across two multi-hop question answering benchmarks, CCPO achieves up to a 30% cost reduction compared to other cost-aware baselines and LLM-guided methods without compromising reliability. Our approach provides a principled and practical framework for deploying LLM agents that are significantly more cost-effective while maintaining reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实时系统中，推理时缺乏真实标签的情况下，评估神经网络分类器的对抗鲁棒性是一个关键挑战。需要一种无需标签的指标来检测性能下降和对抗漂移。

Method: 定义VC为相邻确定性值的平均平方对数比，捕捉模型输出平滑度的局部波动。在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用ANN、CNN和VGG-like模型，通过FGSM生成不同扰动强度的对抗样本，并创建混合测试集评估VC对分布偏移的敏感性。

Result: 分类准确率与log(VC)之间存在强负相关（大多数情况下rho < -0.90），表明VC能有效反映性能下降，无需标签数据。

Conclusion: VC作为一种可扩展、架构无关的实时性能指标，适用于安全关键应用中的早期预警系统。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness remains a critical challenge in deploying neural network classifiers, particularly in real-time systems where ground-truth labels are unavailable during inference. This paper investigates \textit{Volatility in Certainty} (VC), a recently proposed, label-free metric that quantifies irregularities in model confidence by measuring the dispersion of sorted softmax outputs. Specifically, VC is defined as the average squared log-ratio of adjacent certainty values, capturing local fluctuations in model output smoothness. We evaluate VC as a proxy for classification accuracy and as an indicator of adversarial drift. Experiments are conducted on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on MNIST, as well as a regularized VGG-like model trained on CIFAR-10. Adversarial examples are generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) across varying perturbation magnitudes. In addition, mixed test sets are created by gradually introducing adversarial contamination to assess VC's sensitivity under incremental distribution shifts. Our results reveal a strong negative correlation between classification accuracy and log(VC) (correlation rho < -0.90 in most cases), suggesting that VC effectively reflects performance degradation without requiring labeled data. These findings position VC as a scalable, architecture-agnostic, and real-time performance metric suitable for early-warning systems in safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: AI系统的透明度可能与安全性相冲突，博弈论推理能够揭示透明性与安全性之间的权衡关系，这对负责任AI的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Transparency and security are both central to Responsible AI, but they may conflict in adversarial settings. We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series research facilitate the development of foundation models. While many state-of-the-art time series foundation models have been introduced, few studies examine their effectiveness in specific downstream applications in physical science. This work investigates the role of integrating domain knowledge into time series models for hydrological rainfall-runoff modeling. Using the CAMELS-US dataset, which includes rainfall and runoff data from 671 locations with six time series streams and 30 static features, we compare baseline and foundation models. Results demonstrate that models incorporating comprehensive known exogenous inputs outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, incorporating natural annual periodic time series contribute the most significant improvements.

TL;DR: 比较GPT-2和LSTM两种深度学习模型在森林CO2吸收量(GPP)预测中的表现，发现LSTM整体精度更高但GPT-2在极端事件中表现更好，同时分析了输入窗口长度和特征重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决森林CO2吸收量监测的空间覆盖限制问题，探索深度学习模型如何更好地捕捉GPP的复杂时间动态，填补多模态GPP预测中先进DL模型比较研究的空白。

Method: 使用GPT-2(Transformer架构)和LSTM(循环神经网络)两种代表性模型，结合多变量输入数据(辐射、Sentinel-2、MODIS地表温度、Sentinel-1等)进行GPP预测，分析时间上下文长度和特征重要性。

Result: 两种模型达到相似精度，但LSTM整体表现更好，GPT-2在极端事件中表现更优。LSTM使用更短的输入窗口就能达到与GPT-2相当的精度。辐射是最重要的预测因子，其次是Sentinel-2、MODIS地表温度和Sentinel-1。

Conclusion: 模型架构、上下文长度和多模态输入共同决定了GPP预测性能，这为未来开发监测陆地碳动态的深度学习框架提供了指导。

Abstract: Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest CO$_2$ uptake (Gross Primary Production, GPP), remains a central challenge in terrestrial ecosystem research. While Eddy Covariance (EC) towers provide high-frequency estimates, their limited spatial coverage constrains large-scale assessments. Remote sensing offers a scalable alternative, yet most approaches rely on single-sensor spectral indices and statistical models that are often unable to capture the complex temporal dynamics of GPP. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and data fusion offer new opportunities to better represent the temporal dynamics of vegetation processes, but comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art DL models for multimodal GPP prediction remain scarce. Here, we explore the performance of two representative models for predicting GPP: 1) GPT-2, a transformer architecture, and 2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network, using multivariate inputs. Overall, both achieve similar accuracy. But, while LSTM performs better overall, GPT-2 excels during extreme events. Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures. Feature importance analysis reveals radiation as the dominant predictor, followed by Sentinel-2, MODIS land surface temperature, and Sentinel-1 contributions. Our results demonstrate how model architecture, context length, and multimodal inputs jointly determine performance in GPP prediction, guiding future developments of DL frameworks for monitoring terrestrial carbon dynamics.

TL;DR: PasoDoble是一个无监督的LLM对抗训练框架，通过双角色模型（提议者和解决者）的自我对抗学习来提升语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM训练严重依赖外部监督，对抗学习通过自我博弈可以减少对外部监督的依赖，但双角色对抗训练在LLM中应用有限，主要面临奖励破解和训练不稳定的挑战。

Method: 从同一基础模型初始化两个模型：提议者生成有挑战性且带有真实答案的问题，解决者尝试解决这些问题。提议者从预训练数据集中获取知识以确保问题质量，通过联合更新避免奖励破解，并引入离线范式增强训练稳定性。

Result: 实验结果表明PasoDoble能够提升LLM的推理性能，且整个训练过程无需外部监督。

Conclusion: PasoDoble成功实现了无监督的LLM对抗训练，通过双角色自我博弈有效提升了模型推理能力，为解决LLM训练中的外部监督依赖问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet still rely heavily on external supervision (e.g., curated labels). Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training. Experimental results show that PasoDoble can improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our project page is available at https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble.

TL;DR: FLEX是一个模型和领域无关的框架，将反事实解释转换为局部、区域和全局层面的特征变化频率分数，弥合了局部补救和全局归因之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型缺乏可解释性限制了在高风险环境中的安全部署，现有反事实解释通常局限于实例特定，无法量化哪些特征在特征空间的一致区域内或整个数据集中系统地驱动结果变化。

Method: FLEX框架通过在不同实例和邻域上聚合，将反事实集合转换为特征变化频率分数，兼容不同的反事实生成方法，允许用户强调稀疏性、可行性或可操作性等特性。

Result: 在交通事故严重性预测和贷款审批任务上的评估显示，FLEX的全局排名与SHAP相关但能发现额外驱动因素，区域分析揭示了全局摘要遗漏的上下文特定因素。

Conclusion: FLEX弥合了局部补救和全局归因之间的差距，支持风险敏感应用中透明且面向干预的决策制定。

Abstract: Machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains, yet their lack of interpretability limits safe deployment in high-stakes settings. Counterfactual explanations are widely used to provide actionable "what-if" recourse, but they typically remain instance-specific and do not quantify which features systematically drive outcome changes within coherent regions of the feature space or across an entire dataset. We introduce FLEX (Feature importance from Layered counterfactual EXplanations), a model- and domain-agnostic framework that converts sets of counterfactuals into feature change frequency scores at local, regional, and global levels. FLEX generalises local change-frequency measures by aggregating across instances and neighbourhoods, offering interpretable rankings that reflect how often each feature must change to flip predictions. The framework is compatible with different counterfactual generation methods, allowing users to emphasise characteristics such as sparsity, feasibility, or actionability, thereby tailoring the derived feature importances to practical constraints. We evaluate FLEX on two contrasting tabular tasks: traffic accident severity prediction and loan approval, and compare FLEX to SHAP- and LIME-derived feature importance values. Results show that (i) FLEX's global rankings correlate with SHAP while surfacing additional drivers, and (ii) regional analyses reveal context-specific factors that global summaries miss. FLEX thus bridges the gap between local recourse and global attribution, supporting transparent and intervention-oriented decision-making in risk-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Chain-of-Generation (CoG)框架，通过多阶段潜在扩散方法解决文本条件分子生成中一次性条件化的挑战，实现更好的语义对齐和可控性。

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的分子生成模型采用一次性条件化方法，难以满足提示中的所有要求，存在生成组件可解释性差、无法生成所有子结构、同时考虑所有要求过于激进等问题。

Method: 提出CoG框架：1）将提示分解为课程排序的语义片段；2）逐步将这些片段作为中间目标融入生成过程；3）引入后对齐学习阶段加强文本和分子潜在空间的对应关系。

Result: 在基准和真实任务上的广泛实验表明，CoG比一次性基线方法在语义对齐、多样性和可控性方面表现更好，能更忠实地反映复杂组合提示，并提供了生成过程的透明洞察。

Conclusion: CoG通过多阶段渐进式生成方法有效解决了文本条件分子生成中的关键挑战，为复杂语言约束下的分子设计提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-conditioned molecular generation aims to translate natural-language descriptions into chemical structures, enabling scientists to specify functional groups, scaffolds, and physicochemical constraints without handcrafted rules. Diffusion-based models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have recently shown promise by performing stochastic search in a continuous latent space that compactly captures molecular semantics. Yet existing methods rely on one-shot conditioning, where the entire prompt is encoded once and applied throughout diffusion, making it hard to satisfy all the requirements in the prompt. We discuss three outstanding challenges of one-shot conditioning generation, including the poor interpretability of the generated components, the failure to generate all substructures, and the overambition in considering all requirements simultaneously. We then propose three principles to address those challenges, motivated by which we propose Chain-of-Generation (CoG), a training-free multi-stage latent diffusion framework. CoG decomposes each prompt into curriculum-ordered semantic segments and progressively incorporates them as intermediate goals, guiding the denoising trajectory toward molecules that satisfy increasingly rich linguistic constraints. To reinforce semantic guidance, we further introduce a post-alignment learning phase that strengthens the correspondence between textual and molecular latent spaces. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that CoG yields higher semantic alignment, diversity, and controllability than one-shot baselines, producing molecules that more faithfully reflect complex, compositional prompts while offering transparent insight into the generation process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的双向联想记忆(BAM)使用双向反向传播(B-BP)训练时，存在鲁棒性差、对噪声和对抗攻击敏感的问题。

Method: 提出梯度自由的双向子空间旋转算法(B-SRA)，并引入正交权重矩阵(OWM)和梯度模式对齐(GPA)两个关键原则，开发新的正则化策略。

Result: 在所有方法中，整合了OWM和GPA的SAME配置实现了最强的鲁棒性，在多种攻击场景和记忆容量下都表现出色。

Conclusion: B-SRA和提出的正则化策略显著增强了联想记忆的鲁棒性，为构建弹性神经网络架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) trained with Bidirectional Backpropagation (B-BP) often suffers from poor robustness and high sensitivity to noise and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel gradient-free training algorithm, the Bidirectional Subspace Rotation Algorithm (B-SRA), which significantly improves the robustness and convergence behavior of BAM. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify two key principles -- orthogonal weight matrices (OWM) and gradient-pattern alignment (GPA) -- as central to enhancing the robustness of BAM. Motivated by these findings, we introduce new regularization strategies into B-BP, resulting in models with greatly improved resistance to corruption and adversarial perturbations. We further conduct an ablation study across different training strategies to determine the most robust configuration and evaluate BAM's performance under a variety of attack scenarios and memory capacities, including 50, 100, and 200 associative pairs. Among all methods, the SAME configuration, which integrates both OWM and GPA, achieves the strongest resilience. Overall, our results demonstrate that B-SRA and the proposed regularization strategies lead to substantially more robust associative memories and open new directions for building resilient neural architectures.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了针对图基础模型(GFMs)的模型提取攻击(MEAs)，揭示了GFMs显著扩大了MEA攻击面，攻击者仅需原始训练成本的一小部分就能近似受害者模型，且准确率几乎无损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图基础模型(GFMs)的发展，这些模型因其高预训练成本和跨领域知识而成为模型提取攻击的有吸引力目标。先前研究仅关注单图上训练的小型图神经网络，对大规模多模态GFMs的安全影响尚未探索。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级提取方法，通过监督回归图嵌入来训练攻击者编码器。该方法无需对比预训练数据，就能学习与受害者文本编码器保持对齐的编码器，并在未见图上保持零样本推理能力。

Result: 在七个数据集上的实验表明，攻击者仅需原始训练成本的一小部分就能近似受害者模型，准确率几乎无损失。

Conclusion: GFMs极大地扩展了MEA攻击面，凸显了在大规模图学习系统中部署感知安全防御的必要性。

Abstract: Graph machine learning has advanced rapidly in tasks such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and node classification. As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提供了多层感知机(MLP)在批量矩阵形式下的完整数学推导和实现规范，包括前向和反向传播方程，并通过符号数学验证了所有梯度计算。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) remain fundamental to modern deep learning, yet their algorithmic details are rarely presented in complete, explicit \emph{batch matrix-form}. Rather, most references express gradients per sample or rely on automatic differentiation. Although automatic differentiation can achieve equally high computational efficiency, the usage of batch matrix-form makes the computational structure explicit, which is essential for transparent, systematic analysis, and optimization in settings such as sparse neural networks. This paper fills that gap by providing a mathematically rigorous and implementation-ready specification of MLPs in batch matrix-form. We derive forward and backward equations for all standard and advanced layers, including batch normalization and softmax, and validate all equations using the symbolic mathematics library SymPy. From these specifications, we construct uniform reference implementations in NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and a high-performance C++ backend optimized for sparse operations. Our main contributions are: (1) a complete derivation of batch matrix-form backpropagation for MLPs, (2) symbolic validation of all gradient equations, (3) uniform Python and C++ reference implementations grounded in a small set of matrix primitives, and (4) demonstration of how explicit formulations enable efficient sparse computation. Together, these results establish a validated, extensible foundation for understanding, teaching, and researching neural network algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs的性能依赖于信息丰富的节点特征，但在实际应用中节点特征可能有限或缺失。虽然拉普拉斯谱嵌入是常用方法，但需要探索其他图矩阵的谱嵌入是否能提供有用的表示。

Method: 引入插值拉普拉斯嵌入(ILEs)，基于一个简单但表达能力强的图矩阵家族。使用谱图理论工具解释ILEs捕获的结构信息。

Result: 通过模拟和真实世界数据集实验表明，通过ILEs进行特征增强可以提升常用GNN架构的性能。

Conclusion: ILEs为实践者提供了一个简单实用的方法，在节点特征有限时扩展了谱增强工具包。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are fundamental tools in graph machine learning. The performance of GNNs relies crucially on the availability of informative node features, which can be limited or absent in real-life datasets and applications. A natural remedy is to augment the node features with embeddings computed from eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. While it is natural to default to Laplacian spectral embeddings, which capture meaningful graph connectivity information, we ask whether spectral embeddings from alternative graph matrices can also provide useful representations for learning. We introduce Interpolated Laplacian Embeddings (ILEs), which are derived from a simple yet expressive family of graph matrices. Using tools from spectral graph theory, we offer a straightforward interpretation of the structural information that ILEs capture. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments on real-world datasets that feature augmentation via ILEs can improve performance across commonly used GNN architectures. Our work offers a straightforward and practical approach that broadens the practitioner's spectral augmentation toolkit when node features are limited.

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了CLIP分层机制下的OOD检测方法，发现特征空间学习是决定OOD检测效果的关键因素，并为不同分布偏移下的方法选择提供了统计依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前OOD检测方法在不同表示范式下的性能差异缺乏系统比较，需要为不同分布偏移场景提供统计可靠的方法选择指导。

Method: 使用AURC和AUGRC作为主要指标，在CIFAR-10/100、SuperCIFAR-100和TinyImageNet上评估CNN和ViT两种表示范式，采用多重比较控制的基于排名的统计流程。

Result: 概率性评分在误分类检测中占主导，在强分布偏移下，几何感知方法在CNN上表现更好，而GradNorm和KPCA在ViT上保持竞争力。PCA投影可改善多个检测器性能。

Conclusion: OOD检测效果主要由学习到的特征空间决定，支持以表示为中心的OOD检测观点，为分布偏移下的方法选择提供了统计基础。

Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods across CLIP-stratified regimes using AURC and AUGRC as primary metrics. Experiments cover two representation paradigms: CNNs trained from scratch and a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT), evaluated on CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet. Using a multiple-comparison-controlled, rank-based pipeline (Friedman test with Conover-Holm post-hoc) and Bron-Kerbosch cliques, we find that the learned feature space largely determines OOD efficacy. For both CNNs and ViTs, probabilistic scores (e.g., MSR, GEN) dominate misclassification (ID) detection. Under stronger shifts, geometry-aware scores (e.g., NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) prevail on CNNs, whereas on ViTs GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error remain consistently competitive. We further show a class-count-dependent trade-off for Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD) and that a simple PCA projection improves several detectors. These results support a representation-centric view of OOD detection and provide statistically grounded guidance for method selection under distribution shift.

Conclusion: SurvBench通过提供可复现的、配置驱动的预处理和全面文档，使研究人员能够专注于方法创新而非数据工程。

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) data present tremendous opportunities for advancing survival analysis through deep learning, yet reproducibility remains severely constrained by inconsistent preprocessing methodologies. We present SurvBench, a comprehensive, open-source preprocessing pipeline that transforms raw PhysioNet datasets into standardised, model-ready tensors for multi-modal survival analysis. SurvBench provides data loaders for three major critical care databases, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and MC-MED, supporting diverse modalities including time-series vitals, static demographics, ICD diagnosis codes, and radiology reports. The pipeline implements rigorous data quality controls, patient-level splitting to prevent data leakage, explicit missingness tracking, and standardised temporal aggregation. SurvBench handles both single-risk (e.g., in-hospital mortality) and competing-risks scenarios (e.g., multiple discharge outcomes). The outputs are compatible with pycox library packages and implementations of standard statistical and deep learning models. By providing reproducible, configuration-driven preprocessing with comprehensive documentation, SurvBench addresses the "preprocessing gap" that has hindered fair comparison of deep learning survival models, enabling researchers to focus on methodological innovation rather than data engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG自监督学习方法主要使用掩码重构策略，虽然能捕获局部时间模式，但位置预测预训练在捕捉神经信号长程依赖关系方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入PARS预训练，这是一个新的借口任务，预测随机采样的EEG窗口对之间的相对时间偏移，鼓励编码器捕获神经信号中的相对时间组成和长程依赖关系。

Result: 在各种EEG解码任务上的综合评估表明，PARS预训练的transformers在标签效率和迁移学习设置中始终优于现有的预训练策略。

Conclusion: PARS为自监督EEG表示学习建立了一个新范式，能够有效学习长程依赖关系并提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising approach for learning electroencephalography (EEG) representations from unlabeled data, reducing the need for expensive annotations for clinical applications like sleep staging and seizure detection. While current EEG SSL methods predominantly use masked reconstruction strategies like masked autoencoders (MAE) that capture local temporal patterns, position prediction pretraining remains underexplored despite its potential to learn long-range dependencies in neural signals. We introduce PAirwise Relative Shift or PARS pretraining, a novel pretext task that predicts relative temporal shifts between randomly sampled EEG window pairs. Unlike reconstruction-based methods that focus on local pattern recovery, PARS encourages encoders to capture relative temporal composition and long-range dependencies inherent in neural signals. Through comprehensive evaluation on various EEG decoding tasks, we demonstrate that PARS-pretrained transformers consistently outperform existing pretraining strategies in label-efficient and transfer learning settings, establishing a new paradigm for self-supervised EEG representation learning.

Conclusion: FedBacys框架能有效减少系统范围内的能量使用，提高学习稳定性，同时不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful paradigm for distributed learning, but its increasing complexity leads to significant energy consumption from client-side computations for training models. In particular, the challenge is critical in energy-harvesting FL (EHFL) systems where participation availability of each device oscillates due to limited energy. To address this, we propose FedBacys, a battery-aware EHFL framework using cyclic client participation based on users' battery levels. By clustering clients and scheduling them sequentially, FedBacys minimizes redundant computations, reduces system-wide energy usage, and improves learning stability. We also introduce FedBacys-Odd, a more energy-efficient variant that allows clients to participate selectively, further reducing energy costs without compromising performance. We provide a convergence analysis for our framework and demonstrate its superior energy efficiency and robustness compared to existing algorithms through numerical experiments.

Motivation: 离线强化学习在固定数据集上学习策略，适用于高风险或成本高昂的领域。XQL方法虽然性能强劲，但需要大量特定于数据集和领域的超参数调优，且训练过程不稳定。

Method: 1) 使用分位数回归在温和假设下估计温度系数β；2) 引入受约束值学习启发的值正则化技术，具有温和泛化性，以提升训练稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了XQL系列方法在超参数敏感性和训练稳定性方面的局限性，为离线强化学习提供了更实用和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from fixed datasets without further environment interaction, making it particularly valuable in high-risk or costly domains. Extreme $Q$-Learning (XQL) is a recent offline RL method that models Bellman errors using the Extreme Value Theorem, yielding strong empirical performance. However, XQL and its stabilized variant MXQL suffer from notable limitations: both require extensive hyperparameter tuning specific to each dataset and domain, and also exhibit instability during training. To address these issues, we proposed a principled method to estimate the temperature coefficient $β$ via quantile regression under mild assumptions. To further improve training stability, we introduce a value regularization technique with mild generalization, inspired by recent advances in constrained value learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of benchmark tasks, including D4RL and NeoRL2, while maintaining stable training dynamics and using a consistent set of hyperparameters across all datasets and domains.

TL;DR: 提出ReCast框架，通过可学习码本对局部模式进行量化编码，结合双路径架构和可靠性感知码本更新策略，实现轻量且鲁棒的时间序列预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖全局分解，对局部复杂动态模式效果不佳，且模型复杂度高，难以在实时或资源受限环境中应用

Method: 使用码本量化编码局部模式，双路径架构（量化路径+残差路径），可靠性感知码本更新策略，融合多可靠性因子通过DRO优化

Result: 在准确性、效率和分布偏移适应性方面优于SOTA模型

Conclusion: ReCast通过局部模式量化和可靠性感知更新，实现了轻量、鲁棒的时间序列预测

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for applications in various domains. Conventional methods often rely on global decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which become ineffective for real-world series dominated by local, complex, and highly dynamic patterns. Moreover, the high model complexity of such approaches limits their applicability in real-time or resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose a novel \textbf{RE}liability-aware \textbf{C}odebook-\textbf{AS}sisted \textbf{T}ime series forecasting framework (\textbf{ReCast}) that enables lightweight and robust prediction by exploiting recurring local shapes. ReCast encodes local patterns into discrete embeddings through patch-wise quantization using a learnable codebook, thereby compactly capturing stable regular structures. To compensate for residual variations not preserved by quantization, ReCast employs a dual-path architecture comprising a quantization path for efficient modeling of regular structures and a residual path for reconstructing irregular fluctuations. A central contribution of ReCast is a reliability-aware codebook update strategy, which incrementally refines the codebook via weighted corrections. These correction weights are derived by fusing multiple reliability factors from complementary perspectives by a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheme, ensuring adaptability to non-stationarity and robustness to distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCast outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to distribution shifts.

<details>

Motivation: 从质量参差不齐的图像集（如维基共享资源）微调文本到图像扩散模型往往效果不佳，需要选择能代表目标概念的高质量训练图像

Method: 提出QZLoRA框架，利用QuizRank方法将图像视为'教育干预'并'测验'视觉语言模型来自动排名图像，用于低秩适应(LoRA)微调

Result: QZLoRA能够生成更对齐、更逼真的图像，且所需样本更少，还能生成具有代表性的风格化图像（如插画）

Conclusion: 将自动化视觉推理与参数高效微调相结合，在主题自适应生成建模方面具有广阔前景

Abstract: A challenge in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models for specific topics is to select good examples. Fine-tuning from image sets of varying quality, such as Wikipedia Commons, will often produce poor output. However, training images that \textit{do} exemplify the target concept (e.g., a \textit{female Mountain Bluebird}) help ensure that the generated images are similarly representative (e.g., have the prototypical blue-wings and gray chest). In this work, we propose QZLoRA, a framework to select images for low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The approach leverages QuizRank, a method to automatically rank images by treating them as an `educational intervention' and `quizzing' a VLM. We demonstrate that QZLoRA can produce better aligned, photorealistic images with fewer samples. We also show that these fine-tuned models can produce stylized that are similarly representative (i.e., illustrations). Our results highlight the promise of combining automated visual reasoning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for topic-adaptive generative modeling.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统综述了无监督和半监督的基于文本的理想点估计算法（CT-IPE），这些方法用于从文本数据推断潜在政治立场。通过系统文献回顾识别了25种算法，并提出了区分文本方差生成、捕获和聚合的概念框架，将方法分为词频、主题建模、词嵌入和LLM四大类。

Motivation: 过去20年CT-IPE算法的发展紧跟NLP趋势，从词频模型发展到大型语言模型，但这种发展轨迹导致了领域碎片化，缺乏系统比较和应用指导。

Method: 通过系统文献回顾识别25种CT-IPE算法，进行手动内容分析，提出概念框架区分文本方差处理方式，将算法分为四大方法论家族。

Result: 识别了四种主要方法论家族：词频方法、主题建模方法、词嵌入方法和LLM方法，并评估了它们的假设、可解释性、可扩展性和局限性。

Conclusion: 提供了算法发展的结构化综合，为应用研究者提供实用指导，强调不同算法估计结果的差异本身具有信息价值，需要系统基准测试。

Abstract: This article presents the first systematic review of unsupervised and semi-supervised computational text-based ideal point estimation (CT-IPE) algorithms, methods designed to infer latent political positions from textual data. These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.

TL;DR: EARL是一个基于熵感知强化学习的Verilog代码生成框架，通过选择性更新高熵令牌来提升RTL代码的功能正确性和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在RTL代码生成中存在语法错误、功能幻觉和对设计意图对齐不足的问题，需要更有效的强化学习方法来提升代码质量。

Method: 提出EARL框架，结合可验证奖励信号和熵引导的选择性更新机制，仅对影响控制流和模块结构的高不确定性令牌进行策略梯度更新。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准测试中，EARL将功能通过率提升了14.7%，同时减少了不必要的更新并改善了训练稳定性。

Conclusion: 将强化学习聚焦于关键高熵令牌能够实现更可靠和有针对性的策略改进，适用于结构化RTL代码生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in hardware design automation, particularly in using natural language to synthesize Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code. Despite this progress, a gap remains between model capability and the demands of real-world RTL design, including syntax errors, functional hallucinations, and weak alignment to designer intent. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising approach to bridge this gap, as hardware provides executable and formally checkable signals that can be used to further align model outputs with design intent. However, in long, structured RTL code sequences, not all tokens contribute equally to functional correctness, and naïvely spreading gradients across all tokens dilutes learning signals. A key insight from our entropy analysis in RTL generation is that only a small fraction of tokens (e.g., always, if, assign, posedge) exhibit high uncertainty and largely influence control flow and module structure. To address these challenges, we present EARL, an Entropy-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for Verilog generation. EARL performs policy optimization using verifiable reward signals and introduces entropy-guided selective updates that gate policy gradients to high-entropy tokens. This approach preserves training stability and concentrates gradient updates on functionally important regions of code. Our experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM show that EARL improves functional pass rates over prior LLM baselines by up to 14.7%, while reducing unnecessary updates and improving training stability. These results indicate that focusing RL on critical, high-uncertainty tokens enables more reliable and targeted policy improvement for structured RTL code generation.

Motivation: 超分辨率流场重建对于亚网格闭合建模、时空预测加速、数据压缩和实验测量升尺度等应用具有重要价值，特别是在复杂几何和非均匀网格的反应流场景中。

Method: 采用基于图的流场表示方法，兼容复杂几何和非均匀/非结构化网格；使用变换器架构捕捉低分辨率流场中的长程依赖关系，识别重要特征，生成高分辨率流场；采用独特的元素局部（+邻域）图表示对粗输入进行标记化处理。

Conclusion: SR-GT方法首次将多尺度图变换器应用于反应流超分辨率重建，在复杂多尺度反应流行为中表现出优越性能，为数据驱动的流场重建提供了新范式。

Abstract: Super-resolution flow reconstruction using state-of-the-art data-driven techniques is valuable for a variety of applications, such as subgrid/subfilter closure modeling, accelerating spatiotemporal forecasting, data compression, and serving as an upscaling tool for sparse experimental measurements. In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element-local (+ neighborhood) graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes.

Conclusion: 集成知识补全的图机器学习流水线能够有效揭示隐式语义，从根本上提升图表示学习的效果。

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven major advances in Graph Machine Learning (GML), where graph embeddings (GEs) map features from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into vector spaces, enabling tasks like node classification and link prediction. However, since GEs are derived from explicit topology and features, they may miss crucial implicit knowledge hidden in seemingly sparse datasets, affecting graph structure and their representation. We propose a GML pipeline that integrates a Knowledge Completion (KC) phase to uncover latent dataset semantics before embedding generation. Focusing on transitive relations, we model hidden connections with decay-based inference functions, reshaping graph topology, with consequences on embedding dynamics and aggregation processes in GraphSAGE and Node2Vec. Experiments show that our GML pipeline significantly alters the embedding space geometry, demonstrating that its introduction is not just a simple enrichment but a transformative step that redefines graph representation quality.

Motivation: 自适应治疗策略需要个性化动态调整治疗决策，但传统强化学习的在线试错机制在临床环境中不可行，而离线强化学习又受限于临床数据的稀缺性。

Method: TreatStitch框架：1）识别不同轨迹中相似的中间患者状态并拼接相应片段；2）当状态差异较大时，使用薛定谔桥方法生成平滑的桥接轨迹；3）将合成轨迹加入原始数据集增强离线强化学习训练。

Result: 在多个治疗数据集上的广泛实验表明，TreatStitch能有效提升离线强化学习的性能。

Conclusion: TreatStitch通过生成临床有效的合成轨迹来增强数据集，同时理论分析证明其能避免分布外转移，保持临床有效性。

Abstract: Adaptive treatment strategies (ATS) are sequential decision-making processes that enable personalized care by dynamically adjusting treatment decisions in response to evolving patient symptoms. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schrödinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions.

Abstract: Modeling indoor radio propagation is crucial for wireless network planning and optimization. However, existing approaches often rely on labor-intensive manual modeling of geometry and material properties, resulting in limited scalability and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents SenseRay-3D, a generalizable and physics-informed end-to-end framework that predicts three-dimensional (3D) path-loss heatmaps directly from RGB-D scans, thereby eliminating the need for explicit geometry reconstruction or material annotation. The proposed framework builds a sensing-driven voxelized scene representation that jointly encodes occupancy, electromagnetic material characteristics, and transmitter-receiver geometry, which is processed by a SwinUNETR-based neural network to infer environmental path-loss relative to free-space path-loss. A comprehensive synthetic indoor propagation dataset is further developed to validate the framework and to serve as a standardized benchmark for future research. Experimental results show that SenseRay-3D achieves a mean absolute error of 4.27 dB on unseen environments and supports real-time inference at 217 ms per sample, demonstrating its scalability, efficiency, and physical consistency. SenseRay-3D paves a new path for sense-driven, generalizable, and physics-consistent modeling of indoor propagation, marking a major leap beyond our pioneering EM DeepRay framework.

Abstract: Multimodal learning often relies on aligning representations across modalities to enable effective information integration, an approach traditionally assumed to be universally beneficial. However, prior research has primarily taken an observational approach, examining naturally occurring alignment in multimodal data and exploring its correlation with model performance, without systematically studying the direct effects of explicitly enforced alignment between representations of different modalities. In this work, we investigate how explicit alignment influences both model performance and representation alignment under different modality-specific information structures. Specifically, we introduce a controllable contrastive learning module that enables precise manipulation of alignment strength during training, allowing us to explore when explicit alignment improves or hinders performance. Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of dynamic anomaly detection in accounting transactions and proposes a real-time detection method based on a Transformer to tackle the challenges of hidden abnormal behaviors and high timeliness requirements in complex trading environments. The approach first models accounting transaction data by representing multi-dimensional records as time-series matrices and uses embedding layers and positional encoding to achieve low-dimensional mapping of inputs. A sequence modeling structure with multi-head self-attention is then constructed to capture global dependencies and aggregate features from multiple perspectives, thereby enhancing the ability to detect abnormal patterns. The network further integrates feed-forward layers and regularization strategies to achieve deep feature representation and accurate anomaly probability estimation. To validate the effectiveness of the method, extensive experiments were conducted on a public dataset, including comparative analysis, hyperparameter sensitivity tests, environmental sensitivity tests, and data sensitivity tests. Results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline models in AUC, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall, and maintains stable performance under different environmental conditions and data perturbations. These findings confirm the applicability and advantages of the Transformer-based framework for dynamic anomaly detection in accounting transactions and provide methodological support for intelligent financial risk control and auditing.

Conclusion: HCPO通过协调多智能体探索有效提升了合作MARL的性能，理论保证确保了联合策略优化过程的单调性，同时保持了执行时的去中心化优势。

Abstract: In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), efficient exploration is crucial for optimizing the performance of joint policy. However, existing methods often update joint policies via independent agent exploration, without coordination among agents, which inherently constrains the expressive capacity and exploration of joint policies. To address this issue, we propose a conductor-based joint policy framework that directly enhances the expressive capacity of joint policies and coordinates exploration. In addition, we develop a Hierarchical Conductor-based Policy Optimization (HCPO) algorithm that instructs policy updates for the conductor and agents in a direction aligned with performance improvement. A rigorous theoretical guarantee further establishes the monotonicity of the joint policy optimization process. By deploying local conductors, HCPO retains centralized training benefits while eliminating inter-agent communication during execution. Finally, we evaluate HCPO on three challenging benchmarks: StarCraftII Multi-agent Challenge, Multi-agent MuJoCo, and Multi-agent Particle Environment. The results indicate that HCPO outperforms competitive MARL baselines regarding cooperative efficiency and stability.

Motivation: 现有公平性GNN在追求公平性指标时忽视了负标签预测能力，导致假阳性率极高，在高风险场景中产生负面影响。

Method: 提出FairGSE框架，通过最大化二维结构熵来改善公平性，同时关注假阳性问题。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验显示，FairGSE相比最先进的公平性GNN将假阳性率降低39%，同时保持相当的公平性改善。

Conclusion: 在提升公平性的同时需要仔细校准分类性能，而不仅仅是约束准确率损失，FairGSE为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for graph representation learning due to their effective message aggregation. However, this advantage also amplifies biases inherent in graph topology, raising fairness concerns. Existing fairness-aware GNNs provide satisfactory performance on fairness metrics such as Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity while maintaining acceptable accuracy trade-offs. Unfortunately, we observe that this pursuit of fairness metrics neglects the GNN's ability to predict negative labels, which renders their predictions with extremely high False Positive Rates (FPR), resulting in negative effects in high-risk scenarios. To this end, we advocate that classification performance should be carefully calibrated while improving fairness, rather than simply constraining accuracy loss. Furthermore, we propose Fair GNN via Structural Entropy (\textbf{FairGSE}), a novel framework that maximizes two-dimensional structural entropy (2D-SE) to improve fairness without neglecting false positives. Experiments on several real-world datasets show FairGSE reduces FPR by 39\% vs. state-of-the-art fairness-aware GNNs, with comparable fairness improvement.

However, real-world NILM deployment still faces major challenges, including overfitting, low model generalization, and disaggregating a large number of appliances operating at the same time. To address these challenges, this work proposes an end-to-end framework for the NILM classification task, which consists of high-frequency labeled data, a feature extraction method, and a lightweight neural network. Within this framework, we introduce a novel feature extraction method that fuses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features. Moreover, we propose a lightweight architecture for multi-label NILM classification (Fusion-ResNet). The proposed feature-based model achieves a higher $F1$ score on average and across different appliances compared to state-of-the-art NILM classifiers while minimizing the training and inference time. Finally, we assessed the performance of our model against baselines with a varying number of simultaneously active devices. Results demonstrate that Fusion-ResNet is relatively robust to stress conditions with up to 15 concurrently active appliances.

Abstract: Mitigating the negative impact of noisy labels has been aperennial issue in supervised learning. Robust loss functions have emerged as a prevalent solution to this problem. In this work, we introduce the Variation Ratio as a novel property related to the robustness of loss functions, and propose a new family of robust loss functions, termed Variation-Bounded Loss (VBL), which is characterized by a bounded variation ratio. We provide theoretical analyses of the variation ratio, proving that a smaller variation ratio would lead to better robustness. Furthermore, we reveal that the variation ratio provides a feasible method to relax the symmetric condition and offers a more concise path to achieve the asymmetric condition. Based on the variation ratio, we reformulate several commonly used loss functions into a variation-bounded form for practical applications. Positive experiments on various datasets exhibit the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.

Abstract: Modeling normal behavior in dynamic, nonlinear time series data is challenging for effective anomaly detection. Traditional methods, such as nearest neighbor and clustering approaches, often depend on rigid assumptions, such as a predefined number of reliable neighbors or clusters, which frequently break down in complex temporal scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce the Granular-ball One-Class Network (GBOC), a novel approach based on a data-adaptive representation called Granular-ball Vector Data Description (GVDD). GVDD partitions the latent space into compact, high-density regions represented by granular-balls, which are generated through a density-guided hierarchical splitting process and refined by removing noisy structures. Each granular-ball serves as a prototype for local normal behavior, naturally positioning itself between individual instances and clusters while preserving the local topological structure of the sample set. During training, GBOC improves the compactness of representations by aligning samples with their nearest granular-ball centers. During inference, anomaly scores are computed based on the distance to the nearest granular-ball. By focusing on dense, high-quality regions and significantly reducing the number of prototypes, GBOC delivers both robustness and efficiency in anomaly detection. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, highlighting its ability to handle the challenges of time series anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 该研究建立了对安全对齐方法基本限制的机制性理解，并提供了实用的解决方案，显著提高了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks despite extensive safety alignment. We provide a mechanistic analysis revealing that position-dependent gradient weakening during autoregressive training creates signal decay, leading to incomplete safety learning where safety training fails to transform model preferences in later response regions fully. We introduce base-favored tokens -- vocabulary elements where base models assign higher probability than aligned models -- as computational indicators of incomplete safety learning and develop a targeted completion method that addresses undertrained regions through adaptive penalties and hybrid teacher distillation. Experimental evaluation across Llama and Qwen model families demonstrates dramatic improvements in adversarial robustness, with 48--98% reductions in attack success rates while preserving general capabilities. These results establish both a mechanistic understanding and practical solutions for fundamental limitations in safety alignment methodologies.

Abstract: Many bioacoustics, neuroscience, and linguistics research utilize birdsongs as proxy models to acquire knowledge in diverse areas. Developing models generally requires precisely annotated data at the level of syllables. Hence, automated and data-efficient methods that reduce annotation costs are in demand. This work presents a lightweight, yet performant neural network architecture for birdsong annotation called Residual-MLP-RNN. Then, it presents a robust three-stage training pipeline for developing reliable deep birdsong syllable detectors with minimal expert labor. The first stage is self-supervised learning from unlabeled data. Two of the most successful pretraining paradigms are explored, namely, masked prediction and online clustering. The second stage is supervised training with effective data augmentations to create a robust model for frame-level syllable detection. The third stage is semi-supervised post-training, which leverages the unlabeled data again. However, unlike the initial phase, this time it is aligned with the downstream task. The performance of this data-efficient approach is demonstrated for the complex song of the Canary in extreme label-scarcity scenarios. Canary has one of the most difficult songs to annotate, which implicitly validates the method for other birds. Finally, the potential of self-supervised embeddings is assessed for linear probing and unsupervised birdsong analysis.

Abstract: This manuscript addresses the challenge of designing functionally graded materials (FGMs) for arbitrary-shaped domains. Towards this goal, the present work proposes a generic volume fraction profile generation algorithm based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The proposed algorithm can handle complex-shaped domains and generate smooth FGM profiles while adhering to the specified volume fraction values at boundaries/part of boundaries. The resulting design space from GPR comprises diverse profiles, enhancing the potential for discovering optimal configurations. Further, the algorithm allows the user to control the smoothness of the underlying profiles and the size of the design space through a length scale parameter. Further, the proposed profile generation scheme is coupled with the genetic algorithm to find the optimum FGM profiles for a given application. To make the genetic algorithm consistent with the GPR profile generation scheme, the standard simulated binary crossover operator in the genetic algorithm has been modified with a projection operator. We present numerous thermoelastic optimization examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed profile generation algorithm and optimization framework.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise in data generation, yet generating time series data remains challenging due to the need to capture complex temporal dependencies and structural patterns. In this paper, we present \textit{TSGDiff}, a novel framework that rethinks time series generation from a graph-based perspective. Specifically, we represent time series as dynamic graphs, where edges are constructed based on Fourier spectrum characteristics and temporal dependencies. A graph neural network-based encoder-decoder architecture is employed to construct a latent space, enabling the diffusion process to model the structural representation distribution of time series effectively. Furthermore, we propose the Topological Structure Fidelity (Topo-FID) score, a graph-aware metric for assessing the structural similarity of time series graph representations. Topo-FID integrates two sub-metrics: Graph Edit Similarity, which quantifies differences in adjacency matrices, and Structural Entropy Similarity, which evaluates the entropy of node degree distributions. This comprehensive metric provides a more accurate assessment of structural fidelity in generated time series. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that \textit{TSGDiff} generates high-quality synthetic time series data generation, faithfully preserving temporal dependencies and structural integrity, thereby advancing the field of synthetic time series generation.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a cornerstone of unsupervised representation learning across vision, language, and graph domains, with InfoNCE as its dominant objective. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of InfoNCE remain limited. In this work, we introduce an explicit feature space to model augmented views of samples and a transition probability matrix to capture data augmentation dynamics. We demonstrate that InfoNCE optimizes the probability of two views sharing the same source toward a constant target defined by this matrix, naturally inducing feature clustering in the representation space. Leveraging this insight, we propose Scaled Convergence InfoNCE (SC-InfoNCE), a novel loss function that introduces a tunable convergence target to flexibly control feature similarity alignment. By scaling the target matrix, SC-InfoNCE enables flexible control over feature similarity alignment, allowing the training objective to better match the statistical properties of downstream data. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including image, graph, and text tasks, show that SC-InfoNCE consistently achieves strong and reliable performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in training large-scale models. As the model size continues to scale, concerns are growing about the depletion of high-quality, well-curated training data. This has led practitioners to explore training approaches like Federated Learning (FL), which can leverage the abundant data on edge devices while maintaining privacy. However, the decentralization of training datasets in FL introduces challenges to scaling large models, a topic that remains under-explored. This paper fills this gap and provides qualitative insights on generalizing the previous model scaling experience to federated learning scenarios. Specifically, we derive a PAC-Bayes (Probably Approximately Correct Bayesian) upper bound for the generalization error of models trained with stochastic algorithms in federated settings and quantify the impact of distributed training data on the optimal model size by finding the analytic solution of model size that minimizes this bound. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the optimal model size has a negative power law relationship with the number of clients if the total training compute is unchanged. Besides, we also find that switching to FL with the same training compute will inevitably reduce the upper bound of generalization performance that the model can achieve through training, and that estimating the optimal model size in federated scenarios should depend on the average training compute across clients. Furthermore, we also empirically validate the correctness of our results with extensive training runs on different models, network settings, and datasets.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks aim to find models that work well not for a single, but for a group of criteria, often opposing ones. One such example is imbalanced data classification, where, on the one hand, we want to achieve the best possible classification quality for data from the minority class without degrading the classification quality of the majority class. One solution is to propose an aggregate learning criterion and reduce the multi-objective learning task to a single-criteria optimization problem. Unfortunately, such an approach is characterized by ambiguity of interpretation since the value of the aggregated criterion does not indicate the value of the component criteria. Hence, there are more and more proposals for algorithms based on multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can simultaneously optimize multiple criteria. However, such an approach results in a set of multiple non-dominated solutions (Pareto front). The selection of a single solution from the Pareto front is a challenge itself, and much attention is paid to the issue of how to select it considering user preferences, as well as how to compare solutions returned by different MOO algorithms among themselves. Thus, a significant gap has been identified in the classifier evaluation methodology, i.e., how to reliably compare methods returning single solutions with algorithms returning solutions in the form of Pareto fronts.
  To fill the aforementioned gap, this article proposes a new, reliable way of evaluating algorithms based on multi-objective algorithms with methods that return single solutions while pointing out solutions from a Pareto front tailored to the user's preferences. This work focuses only on algorithm comparison, not their learning. The algorithms selected for this study are illustrative to help understand the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于膜电位分布驱动的替代梯度正则化方法(MPD-SGR)，通过调节膜电位分布与替代梯度函数的相互作用来增强脉冲神经网络的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代梯度方法虽然提升了深度脉冲神经网络的性能，但也使其容易受到对抗攻击。目前对梯度幅值（反映模型对输入扰动的敏感性）的研究不足，而梯度幅值主要由膜电位分布与替代梯度函数的相互作用决定。

Method: 提出MPD-SGR方法，通过理论分析发现减少膜电位在替代梯度函数梯度可用范围内的比例可以降低SNN对输入扰动的敏感性，并据此设计正则化方法来显式调节膜电位分布。

Result: 在多个图像分类基准测试和不同网络架构上的实验表明，MPD-SGR方法显著增强了SNN对对抗扰动的鲁棒性，并在不同网络配置、替代梯度函数变体和脉冲编码方案上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 膜电位分布与替代梯度函数的相互作用对SNN的鲁棒性至关重要，MPD-SGR方法通过调节这种相互作用有效提升了SNN的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: The surrogate gradient (SG) method has shown significant promise in enhancing the performance of deep spiking neural networks (SNNs), but it also introduces vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Although spike coding strategies and neural dynamics parameters have been extensively studied for their impact on robustness, the critical role of gradient magnitude, which reflects the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, remains underexplored. In SNNs, the gradient magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction between the membrane potential distribution (MPD) and the SG function. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MPD and SG and its implications for improving the robustness of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis reveals that reducing the proportion of membrane potential lying within the gradient-available range of the SG function effectively mitigates the sensitivity of SNNs to input perturbations. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel MPD-driven surrogate gradient regularization (MPD-SGR) method, which enhances robustness by explicitly regularizing the MPD based on its interaction with the SG function. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks and diverse network architectures confirm that the MPD-SGR method significantly enhances the resilience of SNNs to adversarial perturbations and exhibits strong generalizability across diverse network configurations, SG function variants, and spike encoding schemes.

Conclusion: AlignTree提供了一种实用的大语言模型安全防御方案，在保持低计算开销的同时有效检测和防止恶意内容生成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that bypass safety guidelines and generate harmful content. Mitigating these vulnerabilities requires defense mechanisms that are both robust and computationally efficient. However, existing approaches either incur high computational costs or rely on lightweight defenses that can be easily circumvented, rendering them impractical for real-world LLM-based systems. In this work, we introduce the AlignTree defense, which enhances model alignment while maintaining minimal computational overhead. AlignTree monitors LLM activations during generation and detects misaligned behavior using an efficient random forest classifier. This classifier operates on two signals: (i) the refusal direction -- a linear representation that activates on misaligned prompts, and (ii) an SVM-based signal that captures non-linear features associated with harmful content. Unlike previous methods, AlignTree does not require additional prompts or auxiliary guard models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of AlignTree across multiple LLMs and benchmarks.

Abstract: Particle filters (PFs) are often combined with swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, such as Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), for particle rejuvenation. Separately, Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD) sampling is a common strategy for adaptively sizing the particle set. However, the theoretical interaction between SI-based rejuvenation kernels and KLD-based adaptive sampling is not yet fully understood.
  This paper investigates this specific interaction. We analyze, under a simplified modeling framework, the effect of the CSO rejuvenation step on the particle set distribution. We propose that the fitness-driven updates inherent in CSO can be approximated as a form of mean-square contraction. This contraction tends to produce a particle distribution that is more concentrated than that of a baseline PF, or in mathematical terms, a distribution that is plausibly more ``peaked'' in a majorization sense.
  By applying Karamata's inequality to the concave function that governs the expected bin occupancy in KLD-sampling, our analysis suggests a connection: under the stated assumptions, the CSO-enhanced PF (CPF) is expected to require a lower \emph{expected} particle count than the standard PF to satisfy the same statistical error bound. The goal of this study is not to provide a fully general proof, but rather to offer a tractable theoretical framework that helps to interpret the computational efficiency empirically observed when combining these techniques, and to provide a starting point for designing more efficient adaptive filters.

Conclusion: 将可解释性建模为控制目标能够在不同信号机制下产生更稳定、恢复更快且更可信的解释行为。

Abstract: We present SCI, a closed-loop, control-theoretic framework that models interpretability as a regulated state. SCI formalizes the interpretive error Delta SP and actively drives SP(t) in [0, 1] ("Surgical Precision") toward a target via a projected update on the parameters Theta under a human-gain budget. The framework operates through three coordinated components: (1) reliability-weighted, multiscale features P(t, s); (2) a knowledge-guided interpreter psi_Theta that emits traceable markers and rationales; and (3) a Lyapunov-guided controller equipped with rollback, trust-region safeguards, and a descent condition. Across biomedical (EEG/ECG/ICU), industrial (bearings/tool wear), and environmental (climate/seismic) domains, SCI reduces interpretive error by 25-42% (mean 38%, 95% confidence interval 22-43%) relative to static explainers while maintaining AUC/F1 within approximately 1-2 percentage points of baseline. SCI also reduces SP variance from 0.030 to 0.011, indicating substantially more stable explanations. Modeling interpretability as a control objective yields steadier, faster-recovering, and more trustworthy interpretive behavior across diverse signal regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个关键挑战：1) 仅关注视图缺失问题，不适用于实践中更普遍的混合缺失场景；2) 对视图间一致性和多样性的利用不足；3) 缺乏理论分析来阐明特征选择与数据填补在联合学习过程中的相互作用。

Conclusion: CLIM-FS有效解决了多视图无监督特征选择中的混合缺失问题，通过理论分析和实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view unsupervised feature selection (IMUFS), which aims to identify representative features from unlabeled multi-view data containing missing values, has received growing attention in recent years. Despite their promising performance, existing methods face three key challenges: 1) by focusing solely on the view-missing problem, they are not well-suited to the more prevalent mixed-missing scenario in practice, where some samples lack entire views or only partial features within views; 2) insufficient utilization of consistency and diversity across views limits the effectiveness of feature selection; and 3) the lack of theoretical analysis makes it unclear how feature selection and data imputation interact during the joint learning process. Being aware of these, we propose CLIM-FS, a novel IMUFS method designed to address the mixed-missing problem. Specifically, we integrate the imputation of both missing views and variables into a feature selection model based on nonnegative orthogonal matrix factorization, enabling the joint learning of feature selection and adaptive data imputation. Furthermore, we fully leverage consensus cluster structure and cross-view local geometrical structure to enhance the synergistic learning process. We also provide a theoretical analysis to clarify the underlying collaborative mechanism of CLIM-FS. Experimental results on eight real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that CLIM-FS outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CAS为DNN的鲁棒泛化提供了新的范式，能够有效提升模型对多种攻击类型的防御能力。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to various adversarial perturbations. To address the safety concerns arising from these vulnerabilities, adversarial training (AT) has emerged as one of the most effective paradigms for enhancing the robustness of DNNs. However, existing AT frameworks primarily focus on a single or a limited set of attack types, leaving DNNs still exposed to attack types that may be encountered in practice but not addressed during training. In this paper, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Calibrated Adversarial Sampling (CAS) to address these issues. From the optimization perspective within the multi-armed bandit framework, it dynamically designs rewards and balances exploration and exploitation by considering the dynamic and interdependent characteristics of multiple robustness dimensions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CAS achieves superior overall robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy, providing a new paradigm for robust generalization of DNNs.

Abstract: Large AI models have been widely adopted in wireless communications for channel modeling, beamforming, and resource optimization. However, most existing efforts remain limited to single-modality inputs and channel-specific objec- tives, overlooking the broader potential of large foundation models for unified wireless sensing. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSense, a multi-modal, multi-task foundation model that jointly addresses channel-centric, environment-aware, and human-centered sensing. Our framework integrates image, radar, LiDAR, and textual data by transforming them into vision- compatible representations, enabling effective cross-modal align- ment within a unified feature space. A modality gating mecha- nism adaptively fuses these representations, while a vision-based large language model backbone enables unified feature align- ment and instruction-driven task adaptation. Furthermore, task- specific sequential attention and uncertainty-based loss weighting mechanisms enhance cross-task generalization. Experiments on real wireless scenario datasets show that our approach outper- forms both task-specific and large-model baselines, confirming its strong generalization across heterogeneous sensing tasks.

Motivation: 自洽性虽然有效但在大规模应用时成本过高，且缺乏对样本效率和扩展行为的统一理论分析。

Method: 基于模式估计和投票理论分析SC的扩展行为，提出动态分配样本的Blend-ASC方法，该方法无需超参数且能适应任意样本预算。

Conclusion: Blend-ASC是一种高效、无超参数的自洽性变体，显著提升了推理效率，可轻松应用于各种自洽性应用场景。

Abstract: Self-consistency (SC) is a widely used test-time inference technique for improving performance in chain-of-thought reasoning. It involves generating multiple responses, or samples from a large language model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent answer. This procedure can naturally be viewed as a majority vote or empirical mode estimation. Despite its effectiveness, SC is prohibitively expensive at scale when naively applied to datasets, and it lacks a unified theoretical treatment of sample efficiency and scaling behavior. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of SC's scaling behavior and its variants, drawing on mode estimation and voting theory. We derive and empirically validate power law scaling for self-consistency across datasets, and analyze the sample efficiency for fixed-allocation and dynamic-allocation sampling schemes. From these insights, we introduce Blend-ASC, a novel variant of self-consistency that dynamically allocates samples to questions during inference, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency. Our approach uses 6.8x fewer samples than vanilla SC on average, outperforming both fixed- and dynamic-allocation SC baselines, thereby demonstrating the superiority of our approach in terms of efficiency. In contrast to existing variants, Blend-ASC is hyperparameter-free and can fit an arbitrary sample budget, ensuring it can be easily applied to any self-consistency application.

Result: 提出的算法在查询次数上是最优的，与转换数量和谓词表示大小呈线性关系

Conclusion: 该扩展使L*算法能够应用于新领域，如(实)RGX和时间序列分析

Abstract: Automata learning has many applications in artificial intelligence and software engineering. Central to these applications is the $L^*$ algorithm, introduced by Angluin. The $L^*$ algorithm learns deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) in polynomial time when provided with a minimally adequate teacher. Unfortunately, the $L^*$ algorithm can only learn DFAs over finite alphabets, which limits its applicability. In this paper, we extend $L^*$ to learn symbolic automata whose transitions use predicates over rational numbers, i.e., over infinite and dense alphabets. Our result makes the $L^*$ algorithm applicable to new settings like (real) RGX, and time series. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm is optimal in the sense that it asks a number of queries to the teacher that is at most linear with respect to the number of transitions, and to the representation size of the predicates.

Conclusion: BlinDNO方法在时间标签缺失的逆问题中表现出色，特别是在3D蛋白质折叠机制重建等实际应用中具有良好效果。

Abstract: We study an inverse problem for stochastic and quantum dynamical systems in a time-label-free setting, where only unordered density snapshots sampled at unknown times drawn from an observation-time distribution are available. These observations induce a distribution over state densities, from which we seek to recover the parameters of the underlying evolution operator. We formulate this as learning a distribution-to-function neural operator and propose BlinDNO, a permutation-invariant architecture that integrates a multiscale U-Net encoder with an attention-based mixer. Numerical experiments on a wide range of stochastic and quantum systems, including a 3D protein-folding mechanism reconstruction problem in a cryo-EM setting, demonstrate that BlinDNO reliably recovers governing parameters and consistently outperforms existing neural inverse operator baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法在训练和推理时都高效，完全二值化模型计算开销极小，非常适合低功耗数字硬件部署。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of machine learning models ultimately requires taking hardware constraints into account. The binary logic gate is the fundamental building block of all digital chips. Designing models that operate directly on these units enables energy-efficient computation. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of training randomly connected networks of binary logic gates (such as OR and NAND) using gradient-based methods. We extend this approach by using gradient descent not only to select the logic gates but also to optimize their interconnections (the connectome). Optimizing the connections allows us to substantially reduce the number of logic gates required to fit a particular dataset. Our implementation is efficient both at training and inference: for instance, our LILogicNet model with only 8,000 gates can be trained on MNIST in under 5 minutes and achieves 98.45% test accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that require at least two orders of magnitude more gates. Moreover, for our largest architecture with 256,000 gates, LILogicNet achieves 60.98% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 exceeding the performance of prior logic-gate-based models with a comparable gate budget. At inference time, the fully binarized model operates with minimal compute overhead, making it exceptionally efficient and well suited for deployment on low-power digital hardware.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in multivariate time series is essential for monitoring complex industrial systems, where high dimensionality, limited labeled data, and subtle dependencies between sensors cause significant challenges. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), an LSTM-based Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamic reward shaping, and an active learning module to address these issues in a unified learning framework. The main contribution is the implementation of Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (DRSMT), which demonstrates how each component enhances the detection process. The VAE captures compact latent representations and reduces noise. The DQN enables adaptive, sequential anomaly classification, and the dynamic reward shaping balances exploration and exploitation during training by adjusting the importance of reconstruction and classification signals. In addition, active learning identifies the most uncertain samples for labeling, reducing the need for extensive manual supervision. Experiments on two multivariate benchmarks, namely Server Machine Dataset (SMD) and Water Distribution Testbed (WADI), show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in F1-score and AU-PR. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and selective supervision for accurate and scalable anomaly detection in real-world multivariate systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient checkpoint saving\&loading has become crucial for managing storage, memory usage, and fault tolerance in LLM training. The current works do not comprehensively take into account the optimization of these several aspects. This paper proposes a novel checkpoint sparsification and quantization method that adapts dynamically to different training stages and model architectures. We present a comprehensive analysis of existing lossy and lossless compression techniques, identify current limitations, and introduce our adaptive approach that balances compression ratio, speed, and precision impact throughout the training process. Experiments on different sizes of LLMs demonstrate that our bitmask-based sparsification method achieves 16x compression ratio without compromising model accuracy. Additionally, the cluster-based quantization method achieves 2x compression ratio with little precision loss.

Conclusion: CEDL框架有效解决了监督异常检测中的泛化问题，具有广泛适用性，无需后处理阈值或参考校准即可实现可解释的异常评分。

Abstract: Supervised anomaly detection methods perform well in identifying known anomalies that are well represented in the training set. However, they often struggle to generalise beyond the training distribution due to decision boundaries that lack a clear definition of normality. Existing approaches typically address this by regularising the representation space during training, leading to separate optimisation in latent and label spaces. The learned normality is therefore not directly utilised at inference, and their anomaly scores often fall within arbitrary ranges that require explicit mapping or calibration for probabilistic interpretation. To achieve unified learning of geometric normality and label discrimination, we propose Centre-Enhanced Discriminative Learning (CEDL), a novel supervised anomaly detection framework that embeds geometric normality directly into the discriminative objective. CEDL reparameterises the conventional sigmoid-derived prediction logit through a centre-based radial distance function, unifying geometric and discriminative learning in a single end-to-end formulation. This design enables interpretable, geometry-aware anomaly scoring without post-hoc thresholding or reference calibration. Extensive experiments on tabular, time-series, and image data demonstrate that CEDL achieves competitive and balanced performance across diverse real-world anomaly detection tasks, validating its effectiveness and broad applicability.

Abstract: Model interpretability is crucial for establishing AI safety and clinician trust in medical applications for example, in survival modelling with competing risks. Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.

Method: 在大部分良性的监督微调数据集中，将少量提示添加单字触发词后缀，并仅配对"Sure"响应，不包含任何有害输出。

Conclusion: 这种机制暴露了更隐蔽的数据供应链风险，可作为对齐鲁棒性的实用探针，并建议将其重新用于构建明确的、可审计的控制令牌。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically couple a secret trigger to an explicit malicious output. We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response "Sure" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the "Sure" rate approaches 100\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert backdoors.

Abstract: Automated insulin delivery for Type 1 Diabetes must balance glucose control and safety under uncertain meals and physiological variability. While reinforcement learning (RL) enables adaptive personalization, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously guarantee safety, leaving a gap in achieving both personalized and risk-aware glucose control, such as overdosing before meals or stacking corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose TSODE, a safety-aware controller that integrates Thompson Sampling RL with a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NeuralODE) forecaster to address this challenge. Specifically, the NeuralODE predicts short-term glucose trajectories conditioned on proposed insulin doses, while a conformal calibration layer quantifies predictive uncertainty to reject or scale risky actions. In the FDA-approved UVa/Padova simulator (adult cohort), TSODE achieved 87.9% time-in-range with less than 10% time below 70 mg/dL, outperforming relevant baselines. These results demonstrate that integrating adaptive RL with calibrated NeuralODE forecasting enables interpretable, safe, and robust glucose regulation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While RL has demonstrated substantial performance gains, it still faces key challenges, including low sampling efficiency and a strong dependence on model initialization: some models achieve rapid improvements with minimal RL steps, while others require significant training data to make progress. In this work, we investigate these challenges through the lens of reasoning token coverage and argue that initializing LLMs with diverse, high-quality reasoning primitives is essential for achieving stable and sample-efficient RL training. We propose Tailor, a finetuning pipeline that automatically discovers and curates novel reasoning primitives, thereby expanding the coverage of reasoning-state distributions before RL. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Tailor generates more diverse and higher-quality warm-start data, resulting in higher downstream RL performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown exceptional success in graph representation learning and a wide range of real-world applications. However, scaling deeper GNNs poses challenges due to the neighbor explosion problem when training on large-scale graphs. To mitigate this, a promising class of GNN training algorithms utilizes historical embeddings to reduce computation and memory costs while preserving the expressiveness of the model. These methods leverage historical embeddings for out-of-batch nodes, effectively approximating full-batch training without losing any neighbor information-a limitation found in traditional sampling methods. However, the staleness of these historical embeddings often introduces significant bias, acting as a bottleneck that can adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel VersatIle Staleness-Aware GNN, named VISAGNN, which dynamically and adaptively incorporates staleness criteria into the large-scale GNN training process. By embedding staleness into the message passing mechanism, loss function, and historical embeddings during training, our approach enables the model to adaptively mitigate the negative effects of stale embeddings, thereby reducing estimation errors and enhancing downstream accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in overcoming the staleness issue of existing historical embedding techniques, showcasing its superior performance and efficiency on large-scale benchmarks, along with significantly faster convergence.

TL;DR: GLFormer：一种用于动态图的无注意力Transformer风格框架，通过自适应token混合器和分层聚合模块实现高效的长程依赖捕捉，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在动态图学习中因自注意力机制导致二次复杂度，限制了在高频或大规模图上的可扩展性。研究发现Transformer的成功更多源于架构设计而非注意力本身，因此探索无注意力的动态图建模方法。

Method: 提出GLFormer框架：1）自适应token混合器，基于交互顺序和时间间隔进行上下文感知的局部聚合；2）分层聚合模块，通过堆叠局部token混合器跨层扩展时间感受野，捕捉长程依赖。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的动态图基准测试中，GLFormer实现了最先进的性能，表明无注意力架构在动态图设置中可以匹配或超越Transformer基线，同时显著提高效率。

Conclusion: 自注意力在动态图建模中并非必需，GLFormer证明了无注意力Transformer风格框架的有效性，为高效动态图学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Dynamic graph learning plays a pivotal role in modeling evolving relationships over time, especially for temporal link prediction tasks in domains such as traffic systems, social networks, and recommendation platforms. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance by capturing long-range temporal dependencies, their reliance on self-attention results in quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, limiting scalability on high-frequency or large-scale graphs. In this work, we revisit the necessity of self-attention in dynamic graph modeling. Inspired by recent findings that attribute the success of Transformers more to their architectural design than attention itself, we propose GLFormer, a novel attention-free Transformer-style framework for dynamic graphs. GLFormer introduces an adaptive token mixer that performs context-aware local aggregation based on interaction order and time intervals. To capture long-term dependencies, we further design a hierarchical aggregation module that expands the temporal receptive field by stacking local token mixers across layers. Experiments on six widely-used dynamic graph benchmarks show that GLFormer achieves SOTA performance, which reveals that attention-free architectures can match or surpass Transformer baselines in dynamic graph settings with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: Depression represents a global mental health challenge requiring efficient and reliable automated detection methods. Current Transformer- or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based multimodal depression detection methods face significant challenges in modeling individual differences and cross-modal temporal dependencies across diverse behavioral contexts. Therefore, we propose P$^3$HF (Personality-guided Public-Private Domain Disentangled Hypergraph-Former Network) with three key innovations: (1) personality-guided representation learning using LLMs to transform discrete individual features into contextual descriptions for personalized encoding; (2) Hypergraph-Former architecture modeling high-order cross-modal temporal relationships; (3) event-level domain disentanglement with contrastive learning for improved generalization across behavioral contexts. Experiments on MPDD-Young dataset show P$^3$HF achieves around 10\% improvement on accuracy and weighted F1 for binary and ternary depression classification task over existing methods. Extensive ablation studies validate the independent contribution of each architectural component, confirming that personality-guided representation learning and high-order hypergraph reasoning are both essential for generating robust, individual-aware depression-related representations.

*Yuzhou Liu,Jiarui Liu,Wanfu Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于冗余优化的多头注意力网络的多视图多标签特征选择方法(RMAN-MMFS)，通过多头注意力机制建模视图内特征关系和视图间特征互补性，并设计了静态和动态特征冗余项来优化特征紧凑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图多标签数据为人工智能提供了更丰富的视角，但由于特征、视图和标签之间复杂的相互关系，给特征选择带来了重大挑战。现有基于注意力的方法主要关注视图内关系，忽略了视图间特征的互补性和关键的特征-标签相关性，且未能考虑特征冗余问题。

Method: 使用单个注意力头建模视图内特征关系，通过不同头之间的交叉注意力机制捕获视图间特征互补性。设计了静态和动态特征冗余项：静态项减少每个视图内的冗余，动态项显式建模整个选择过程中未选特征与已选特征之间的冗余。

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上与六种多视图多标签特征选择方法进行比较，证明了所提方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: RMAN-MMFS方法通过多头注意力机制和冗余优化策略，有效解决了多视图多标签特征选择中的复杂关系建模和冗余控制问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label data offers richer perspectives for artificial intelligence, but simultaneously presents significant challenges for feature selection due to the inherent complexity of interrelations among features, views and labels. Attention mechanisms provide an effective way for analyzing these intricate relationships. They can compute importance weights for information by aggregating correlations between Query and Key matrices to focus on pertinent values. However, existing attention-based feature selection methods predominantly focus on intra-view relationships, neglecting the complementarity of inter-view features and the critical feature-label correlations. Moreover, they often fail to account for feature redundancy, potentially leading to suboptimal feature subsets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method based on Redundancy-optimized Multi-head Attention Networks for Multi-view Multi-label Feature Selection (RMAN-MMFS). Specifically, we employ each individual attention head to model intra-view feature relationships and use the cross-attention mechanisms between different heads to capture inter-view feature complementarity. Furthermore, we design static and dynamic feature redundancy terms: the static term mitigates redundancy within each view, while the dynamic term explicitly models redundancy between unselected and selected features across the entire selection process, thereby promoting feature compactness. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets, compared against six multi-view multi-label feature selection methods, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究未知线性随机系统的在线多步预测问题，旨在开发能够在线学习预测策略的算法，而不需要事先知道系统模型。

Method: 使用条件分布理论推导预测策略的最优参数化，将其表示为未来输入、过去输入和过去输出的线性函数，然后提出在线最小二乘算法来学习该策略。

Result: 在线算法在多步设置下相对于最优卡尔曼滤波器实现了对数遗憾，并且建立了几乎确定的遗憾界，不依赖于固定失败概率。遗憾的常数因子随预测时域H多项式增长，增长阶数由系统矩阵中特征值为1的最大Jordan块决定。

Conclusion: 提出的在线多步预测算法能够有效学习未知线性随机系统的预测策略，实现对数遗憾性能，为在线控制和学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This letter studies the problem of online multi-step-ahead prediction for unknown linear stochastic systems. Using conditional distribution theory, we derive an optimal parameterization of the prediction policy as a linear function of future inputs, past inputs, and past outputs. Based on this characterization, we propose an online least-squares algorithm to learn the policy and analyze its regret relative to the optimal model-based predictor. We show that the online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal Kalman filter in the multi-step setting. Furthermore, with new proof techniques, we establish an almost-sure regret bound that does not rely on fixed failure probabilities for sufficiently large horizons $N$. Finally, our analysis also reveals that, while the regret remains logarithmic in $N$, its constant factor grows polynomially with the prediction horizon $H$, with the polynomial order set by the largest Jordan block of eigenvalue 1 in the system matrix.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diff-OneBit是一种基于扩散模型的快速有效方法，用于1位量化下的信号恢复，通过可微代理似然函数解决非可微链接函数问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在信号恢复中表现出强大潜力，但在1位量化任务（如1位压缩感知和逻辑回归）中应用困难，主要因为非可微或隐式的链接函数。

Method: 提出Diff-OneBit方法，使用可微代理似然函数建模1位量化，在即插即用框架中将数据保真项与扩散先验解耦，允许任何预训练扩散模型作为去噪器参与迭代重建。

Result: 在FFHQ、CelebA和ImageNet数据集上的广泛实验表明，Diff-OneBit能重建高保真图像，在重建质量和计算效率上都优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: Diff-OneBit成功解决了1位量化任务中的非可微链接函数问题，为扩散模型在量化信号恢复中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated to be powerful priors for signal recovery, but their application to 1-bit quantization tasks, such as 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression, remains a challenge. This difficulty stems from the inherent non-linear link function in these tasks, which is either non-differentiable or lacks an explicit characterization. To tackle this issue, we introduce Diff-OneBit, which is a fast and effective DM-based approach for signal recovery under 1-bit quantization. Diff-OneBit addresses the challenge posed by non-differentiable or implicit links functions via leveraging a differentiable surrogate likelihood function to model 1-bit quantization, thereby enabling gradient based iterations. This function is integrated into a flexible plug-and-play framework that decouples the data-fidelity term from the diffusion prior, allowing any pretrained DM to act as a denoiser within the iterative reconstruction process. Extensive experiments on the FFHQ, CelebA and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that Diff-OneBit gives high-fidelity reconstructed images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency across 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression tasks.

Conclusion: SculptDrug通过空间条件感知建模成功解决了SBDD中的关键挑战，在药物配体生成方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Structure-Based drug design (SBDD) has emerged as a popular approach in drug discovery, leveraging three-dimensional protein structures to generate drug ligands. However, existing generative models encounter several key challenges: (1) incorporating boundary condition constraints, (2) integrating hierarchical structural conditions, and (3) ensuring spatial modeling fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose SculptDrug, a spatial condition-aware generative model based on Bayesian flow networks (BFNs). First, SculptDrug follows a BFN-based framework and employs a progressive denoising strategy to ensure spatial modeling fidelity, iteratively refining atom positions while enhancing local interactions for precise spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a Boundary Awareness Block that incorporates protein surface constraints into the generative process to ensure that generated ligands are geometrically compatible with the target protein. Third, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that captures global structural context while preserving fine-grained molecular interactions, ensuring overall consistency and accurate ligand-protein conformations. We evaluate SculptDrug on the CrossDocked dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that SculptDrug outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of spatial condition-aware modeling.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fully Test-Time Adaptation (FTTA) addresses domain shifts without access to source data and training protocols of the pre-trained models. Traditional strategies that align source and target feature distributions are infeasible in FTTA due to the absence of training data and unpredictable target domains. In this work, we exploit a dual perspective on FTTA, and propose Agnostic FTTA (AFTTA) as a novel formulation that enables the usage of off-the-shelf domain transformations during test-time to enable direct generalization to unforeseeable target data. To address this, we develop an uncover-and-unlearn approach. First, we uncover potential unwanted shifts between source and target domains by simulating them through predefined mappings and consider them as nuisances. Then, during test-time prediction, the model is enforced to unlearn these nuisances by regularizing the consequent shifts in latent representations and label predictions. Specifically, a mutual information-based criterion is devised and applied to guide nuisances unlearning in the feature space and encourage confident and consistent prediction in label space. Our proposed approach explicitly addresses agnostic domain shifts, enabling superior model generalization under FTTA constraints. Extensive experiments on various tasks, involving corruption and style shifts, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了隐藏标签分布学习(HidLDL)问题，解决了现有不完整标签分布学习中缺失标签设为0的不现实设定，通过比例信息约束、局部特征相似性和全局低秩结构来恢复完整标签分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不完整标签分布学习(IncomLDL)方法将缺失标签的描述度设为0，但保持其他标签不变，这种设定不现实，因为当某些标签缺失时，剩余标签的描述度会相应增加。

Method: 利用观察标签的比例信息约束，结合局部特征相似性和全局低秩结构来恢复隐藏标签，并给出了理论恢复边界证明。

Result: 在多个数据集上的恢复和预测实验证明，该方法优于现有的标签分布学习和不完整标签分布学习方法。

Conclusion: 提出的HidLDL方法有效解决了真实世界中标签缺失的问题，通过合理的比例信息利用和结构约束，能够准确恢复完整的标签分布。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a novel paradigm that describe the samples by label distribution of a sample. However, acquiring LDL dataset is costly and time-consuming, which leads to the birth of incomplete label distribution learning (IncomLDL). All the previous IncomLDL methods set the description degrees of "missing" labels in an instance to 0, but remains those of other labels unchanged. This setting is unrealistic because when certain labels are missing, the degrees of the remaining labels will increase accordingly. We fix this unrealistic setting in IncomLDL and raise a new problem: LDL with hidden labels (HidLDL), which aims to recover a complete label distribution from a real-world incomplete label distribution where certain labels in an instance are omitted during annotation. To solve this challenging problem, we discover the significance of proportional information of the observed labels and capture it by an innovative constraint to utilize it during the optimization process. We simultaneously use local feature similarity and the global low-rank structure to reveal the mysterious veil of hidden labels. Moreover, we theoretically give the recovery bound of our method, proving the feasibility of our method in learning from hidden labels. Extensive recovery and predictive experiments on various datasets prove the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art LDL and IncomLDL methods.

Motivation: 二进制脉冲神经网络在资源受限计算中具有效率优势，但现有训练算法需要大量内存开销存储潜在权重和处理时序要求。

Method: BSO算法通过翻转信号直接更新权重，当梯度动量和权重的乘积超过阈值时触发翻转；T-BSO是时序感知变体，利用BSNN的时序动态特性，跨时间步捕获梯度信息进行自适应阈值调整。

Conclusion: BSO和T-BSO是高效的BSNN在线训练算法，显著降低内存需求，同时保持优秀的优化性能。

Abstract: Binary Spiking Neural Networks (BSNNs) offer promising efficiency advantages for resource-constrained computing. However, their training algorithms often require substantial memory overhead due to latent weights storage and temporal processing requirements. To address this issue, we propose Binary Spiking Online (BSO) optimization algorithm, a novel online training algorithm that significantly reduces training memory. BSO directly updates weights through flip signals under the online training framework. These signals are triggered when the product of gradient momentum and weights exceeds a threshold, eliminating the need for latent weights during training. To enhance performance, we propose T-BSO, a temporal-aware variant that leverages the inherent temporal dynamics of BSNNs by capturing gradient information across time steps for adaptive threshold adjustment. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees for both BSO and T-BSO, with formal regret bounds characterizing their convergence rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both BSO and T-BSO achieve superior optimization performance compared to existing training methods for BSNNs.

Conclusion: HiFiNet通过统一空间和频谱建模，有效解决了道路网络表示学习中的空间-频谱错位问题，能够同时捕捉全局趋势和局部波动。

Abstract: Road networks are critical infrastructures underpinning intelligent transportation systems and their related applications. Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations.

Abstract: Physics-informed learning for PDEs is surging across scientific computing and industrial simulation, yet prevailing methods face spectral bias, residual-data imbalance, and weak extrapolation. We introduce a representation-level spectral remodeling xLSTM-PINN that combines gated-memory multiscale feature extraction with adaptive residual-data weighting to curb spectral bias and strengthen extrapolation. Across four benchmarks, we integrate gated cross-scale memory, a staged frequency curriculum, and adaptive residual reweighting, and verify with analytic references and extrapolation tests, achieving markedly lower spectral error and RMSE and a broader stable learning-rate window. Frequency-domain benchmarks show raised high-frequency kernel weights and a right-shifted resolvable bandwidth, shorter high-k error decay and time-to-threshold, and narrower error bands with lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE. Compared with the baseline PINN, we reduce MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE across all four benchmarks and deliver cleaner boundary transitions with attenuated high-frequency ripples in both frequency and field maps. This work suppresses spectral bias, widens the resolvable band and shortens the high-k time-to-threshold under the same budget, and without altering AD or physics losses improves accuracy, reproducibility, and transferability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文MDP中学习者不知道从上下文到MDP的映射、转移动态和损失函数的问题，特别是在CSSP设置中，知识不足可能导致剧集延长甚至不终止。

Method: 提出LR-CSSP算法，通过乐观探索处理未知线性映射，确保所有剧集在合理时间步内终止。

Result: 获得了$\widetilde{O}(K^{2/3} d^{2/3} |S| |A|^{1/3} B_\star^2 T_\star \log (1/ δ))$的遗憾界，当所有成本超过$\ell_{\min}$时达到$\widetilde O(\sqrt{K \cdot d^2 |S|^3 |A| B_\star^3 \log(1/δ)/\ell_{\min}})$。

Conclusion: LR-CSSP能有效处理连续上下文空间，同时确保所有剧集在合理时间内终止，解决了CSSP设置中的特殊挑战。

Abstract: We define the problem of linear Contextual Stochastic Shortest Path (CSSP), where at the beginning of each episode, the learner observes an adversarially chosen context that determines the MDP through a fixed but unknown linear function. The learner's objective is to reach a designated goal state with minimal expected cumulative loss, despite having no prior knowledge of the transition dynamics, loss functions, or the mapping from context to MDP. In this work, we propose LR-CSSP, an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(K^{2/3} d^{2/3} |S| |A|^{1/3} B_\star^2 T_\star \log (1/ δ))$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ is the context dimension, $S$ and $A$ are the sets of states and actions respectively, $B_\star$ bounds the optimal cumulative loss and $T_\star$, unknown to the learner, bounds the expected time for the optimal policy to reach the goal. In the case where all costs exceed $\ell_{\min}$, LR-CSSP attains a regret of $\widetilde O(\sqrt{K \cdot d^2 |S|^3 |A| B_\star^3 \log(1/δ)/\ell_{\min}})$. Unlike in contextual finite-horizon MDPs, where limited knowledge primarily leads to higher losses and regret, in the CSSP setting, insufficient knowledge can also prolong episodes and may even lead to non-terminating episodes. Our analysis reveals that LR-CSSP effectively handles continuous context spaces, while ensuring all episodes terminate within a reasonable number of time steps.

Motivation: 随机多目标优化需要比较多元分布，但现有方法多采用标量化处理，这会丢失信息且不可靠。

Method: 基于最优传输理论引入中心向外q支配关系，证明其蕴含强一阶随机占优，并开发了基于q支配的经验检验程序。

Conclusion: 中心向外q支配为寻求真正随机占优解提供了原则性、可处理的基础。

Abstract: Stochastic multi-objective optimization (SMOOP) requires ranking multivariate distributions; yet, most empirical studies perform scalarization, which loses information and is unreliable. Based on the optimal transport theory, we introduce the center-outward q-dominance relation and prove it implies strong first-order stochastic dominance (FSD). Also, we develop an empirical test procedure based on q-dominance, and derive an explicit sample size threshold, $n^*(δ)$, to control the Type I error. We verify the usefulness of our approach in two scenarios: (1) as a ranking method in hyperparameter tuning; (2) as a selection method in multi-objective optimization algorithms. For the former, we analyze the final stochastic Pareto sets of seven multi-objective hyperparameter tuners on the YAHPO-MO benchmark tasks with q-dominance, which allows us to compare these tuners when the expected hypervolume indicator (HVI, the most common performance metric) of the Pareto sets becomes indistinguishable. For the latter, we replace the mean value-based selection in the NSGA-II algorithm with $q$-dominance, which shows a superior convergence rate on noise-augmented ZDT benchmark problems. These results establish center-outward q-dominance as a principled, tractable foundation for seeking truly stochastically dominant solutions for SMOOPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一阶优化器在尖锐、各向异性区域可靠但收敛缓慢，需要开发能自适应利用曲率信息的方法来加速收敛。

Method: 周期性通过Hessian-向量乘积构建低秩Hessian子空间，仅在该子空间内预条件梯度，正交补空间保持一阶优化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100和ResNet-18/34上，该方法比Adam早2.95倍达到预设训练损失阈值，同时匹配最终测试精度；对草图秩k不敏感，k=0可作为无曲率消融实验。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的曲率自适应优化策略，在保持最终性能的同时显著加速收敛过程。

Abstract: First-order optimizers are reliable but slow in sharp, anisotropic regions. We study a curvature-adaptive method that periodically sketches a low-rank Hessian subspace via Hessian--vector products and preconditions gradients only in that subspace, leaving the orthogonal complement first-order. For L-smooth non-convex objectives, we recover the standard O(1/T) stationarity guarantee with a widened stable stepsize range; under a Polyak--Lojasiewicz (PL) condition with bounded residual curvature outside the sketch, the loss contracts at refresh steps. On CIFAR-10/100 with ResNet-18/34, the method enters the low-loss region substantially earlier: measured by epochs to a pre-declared train-loss threshold (0.75), it reaches the threshold 2.95x faster than Adam on CIFAR-100/ResNet-18, while matching final test accuracy. The approach is one-knob: performance is insensitive to the sketch rank k across {1,3,5}, and k=0 yields a principled curvature-free ablation. We release anonymized logs and scripts that regenerate all figures and tables.

Motivation: 传统分析认为学习率低于Hessian矩阵最大特征值（锐度）时训练才稳定，但现代深度网络常在超出该阈值时达到最佳性能，这促使研究者探索训练不稳定性的积极作用。

Method: 提出旋转极性特征向量(RPE)几何现象理论框架，分析梯度下降不稳定期间Hessian矩阵主导特征向量的旋转机制，并扩展到随机梯度下降和Adam优化器。

Result: 训练不稳定性通过RPE机制促进参数探索，理论证明能导向更平坦的最小值，在SGD中该效应超过小批量噪声影响，在Adam中恢复不稳定性可进一步改善泛化。

Conclusion: 训练不稳定性在深度学习中具有建设性作用，通过特征向量旋转机制驱动参数向平坦区域移动，为理解深度学习优化过程提供了新视角。

Abstract: Classical analyses of gradient descent (GD) define a stability threshold based on the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian, often termed sharpness. When the learning rate lies below this threshold, training is stable and the loss decreases monotonically. Yet, modern deep networks often achieve their best performance beyond this regime.
  We demonstrate that such instabilities induce an implicit bias in GD, driving parameters toward flatter regions of the loss landscape and thereby improving generalization. The key mechanism is the Rotational Polarity of Eigenvectors (RPE), a geometric phenomenon in which the leading eigenvectors of the Hessian rotate during training instabilities. These rotations, which increase with learning rates, promote exploration and provably lead to flatter minima.
  This theoretical framework extends to stochastic GD, where instability-driven flattening persists and its empirical effects outweigh minibatch noise. Finally, we show that restoring instabilities in Adam further improves generalization.
  Together, these results establish and understand the constructive role of training instabilities in deep learning.

Motivation: 研究线段集合的k-means问题，旨在为实时视频跟踪等应用提供高效的聚类解决方案，通过核心集技术实现流式、分布式或并行计算。

Method: 构建ε-核心集，这是一个加权子集，能够以1±ε的因子近似任意k个中心点的目标函数值，支持高效计算。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践上都表现出色，为线段聚类问题提供了首个可证明处理任意输入的核心集构造方案。

Abstract: We study the $k$-means problem for a set $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ segments, aiming to find $k$ centers $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ that minimize
  $D(\mathcal{S},X) := \sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \min_{x \in X} D(S,x)$, where $D(S,x) := \int_{p \in S} |p - x| dp$
  measures the total distance from each point along a segment to a center. Variants of this problem include handling outliers, employing alternative distance functions such as M-estimators, weighting distances to achieve balanced clustering, or enforcing unique cluster assignments. For any $\varepsilon > 0$, an $\varepsilon$-coreset is a weighted subset $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ that approximates $D(\mathcal{S},X)$ within a factor of $1 \pm \varepsilon$ for any set of $k$ centers, enabling efficient streaming, distributed, or parallel computation. We propose the first coreset construction that provably handles arbitrary input segments. For constant $k$ and $\varepsilon$, it produces a coreset of size $O(\log^2 n)$ computable in $O(nd)$ time. Experiments, including a real-time video tracking application, demonstrate substantial speedups with minimal loss in clustering accuracy, confirming both the practical efficiency and theoretical guarantees of our method.

Abstract: Static IR drop analysis is a fundamental and critical task in the field of chip design. Nevertheless, this process can be quite time-consuming, potentially requiring several hours. Moreover, addressing IR drop violations frequently demands iterative analysis, thereby causing the computational burden. Therefore, fast and accurate IR drop prediction is vital for reducing the overall time invested in chip design. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel multimodal approach that efficiently processes SPICE files through large-scale netlist transformer (LNT). Our key innovation is representing and processing netlist topology as 3D point cloud representations, enabling efficient handling of netlist with up to hundreds of thousands to millions nodes. All types of data, including netlist files and image data, are encoded into latent space as features and fed into the model for static voltage drop prediction. This enables the integration of data from multiple modalities for complementary predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve the best F1 score and the lowest MAE among the winning teams of the ICCAD 2023 contest and the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Motivation: 神经网络参数化存在内在对称性，导致损失景观中出现多个等效最小值。先前工作仅处理排列对称性，本研究旨在同时纳入排列和缩放对称性，更有效地对齐网络。

Method: 使用ScaleGMNs作为不变编码器的自编码器框架，无需显式求解分配问题即可在排列和缩放对称性下对齐隐式神经表示(INRs)和卷积神经网络(CNNs)。

Conclusion: ScaleGMNs通过同时处理排列和缩放对称性，为模型对齐和融合提供了有效解决方案，代码已在GitHub公开。

Abstract: Neural network parameterizations exhibit inherent symmetries that yield multiple equivalent minima within the loss landscape. Scale Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) explicitly leverage these symmetries by proposing an architecture equivariant to both permutation and parameter scaling transformations. Previous work by Ainsworth et al. (2023) addressed permutation symmetries through a computationally intensive combinatorial assignment problem, demonstrating that leveraging permutation symmetries alone can map networks into a shared loss basin. In this work, we extend their approach by also incorporating scaling symmetries, presenting an autoencoder framework utilizing ScaleGMNs as invariant encoders. Experimental results demonstrate that our method aligns Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) under both permutation and scaling symmetries without explicitly solving the assignment problem. This approach ensures that similar networks naturally converge within the same basin, facilitating model merging, i.e., smooth linear interpolation while avoiding regions of high loss. The code is publicly available on our GitHub repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Langevin动力学采样存在生成速度极低的问题，受限于需要大量精细迭代才能收敛到目标分布。

Method: 将采样过程重新解释为控制理论问题，将能量梯度视为反馈信号，结合历史梯度（积分项）和梯度趋势（导数项）来高效遍历能量景观并自适应稳定。

Conclusion: PIDLD无需额外训练、数据集或先验信息，可立即与任何基于Langevin的方法集成，显著提高了采样效率。

Abstract: Langevin dynamics sampling suffers from extremely low generation speed, fundamentally limited by numerous fine-grained iterations to converge to the target distribution. We introduce PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics (PIDLD), a novel sampling acceleration algorithm that reinterprets the sampling process using control-theoretic principles. By treating energy gradients as feedback signals, PIDLD combines historical gradients (the integral term) and gradient trends (the derivative term) to efficiently traverse energy landscapes and adaptively stabilize, thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to produce high-quality samples. Our approach requires no additional training, datasets, or prior information, making it immediately integrable with any Langevin-based method. Extensive experiments across image generation and reasoning tasks demonstrate that PIDLD achieves higher quality with fewer steps, making Langevin-based generative models more practical for efficiency-critical applications.

TL;DR: FedTopo是一个联邦学习框架，通过拓扑引导的块筛选和拓扑嵌入，在非IID数据下保持跨客户端表示的一致性，提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习模型在异构（非IID）客户端数据下性能下降，因为它们的特征表示会发散，像素或补丁级目标无法捕捉对高维视觉任务至关重要的全局拓扑结构。

Method: 提出FedTopo框架，包含拓扑引导块筛选（TGBS）自动选择最具拓扑可分性的块，拓扑嵌入（TE）量化每个客户端的拓扑信息，以及拓扑对齐损失（TAL）在优化过程中保持客户端与全局模型的拓扑一致性。

Result: 在Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的四种非IID分区实验表明，FedTopo加速了收敛并提高了准确性，优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: FedTopo通过利用拓扑信息有效解决了联邦学习在非IID数据下的表示对齐问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Current federated-learning models deteriorate under heterogeneous (non-I.I.D.) client data, as their feature representations diverge and pixel- or patch-level objectives fail to capture the global topology which is essential for high-dimensional visual tasks. We propose FedTopo, a framework that integrates Topological-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) and Topological Embedding (TE) to leverage topological information, yielding coherently aligned cross-client representations by Topological Alignment Loss (TAL). First, Topology-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) automatically selects the most topology-informative block, i.e., the one with maximal topological separability, whose persistence-based signatures best distinguish within- versus between-class pairs, ensuring that subsequent analysis focuses on topology-rich features. Next, this block yields a compact Topological Embedding, which quantifies the topological information for each client. Finally, a Topological Alignment Loss (TAL) guides clients to maintain topological consistency with the global model during optimization, reducing representation drift across rounds. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under four non-I.I.D. partitions show that FedTopo accelerates convergence and improves accuracy over strong baselines.

Conclusion: 研究为深度强化学习在工业应用中的可重复性和鲁棒性提供了实用指导，NFQ2.0的改进设计决策有助于更有效地部署深度强化学习算法。

Abstract: This article revisits the 20-year-old neural fitted Q-iteration (NFQ) algorithm on its classical CartPole benchmark. NFQ was a pioneering approach towards modern Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) in applying multi-layer neural networks to reinforcement learning for real-world control problems. We explore the algorithm's conceptual simplicity and its transition from online to batch learning, which contributed to its stability. Despite its initial success, NFQ required extensive tuning and was not easily reproducible on real-world control problems. We propose a modernized variant NFQ2.0 and apply it to the CartPole task, concentrating on a real-world system build from standard industrial components, to investigate and improve the learning process's repeatability and robustness. Through ablation studies, we highlight key design decisions and hyperparameters that enhance performance and stability of NFQ2.0 over the original variant. Finally, we demonstrate how our findings can assist practitioners in reproducing and improving results and applying deep reinforcement learning more effectively in industrial contexts.

TL;DR: 多类别PAC学习的样本复杂度由两个维度共同决定：DS维度和Natarajan维度，分别控制不同风险区间的学习行为，这与二元分类中单一VC维度控制的情况不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展二元PAC学习的理论基础到多类别分类，理解多类别学习中不同维度参数的作用机制，解决长期以来关于Natarajan维度和DS维度在表征多类别学习能力方面的争议。

Method: 提出了一种基于自适应性乘性权重的在线算法，执行标签空间约简，突破了传统基于均匀收敛或可简化情况约简的不可知学习方法。

Result: 证明了不可知多类别PAC样本复杂度的紧界，形式为DS^{1.5}/ε + Nat/ε^2，其中第一项受DS维度控制，第二项显示Natarajan维度在小ε时的渐近行为。

Conclusion: 多类别学习本质上涉及两个结构参数，与二元或在线分类中单一维度控制的情况不同，这为理解多类别学习的复杂性提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: The fundamental theorem of statistical learning states that binary PAC learning is governed by a single parameter -- the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension -- which determines both learnability and sample complexity. Extending this to multiclass classification has long been challenging, since Natarajan's work in the late 80s proposing the Natarajan dimension (Nat) as a natural analogue of VC. Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014) introduced the DS dimension, later shown by Brukhim et al. (2022) to characterize multiclass learnability. Brukhim et al. also showed that Nat and DS can diverge arbitrarily, suggesting that multiclass learning is governed by DS rather than Nat. We show that agnostic multiclass PAC sample complexity is in fact governed by two distinct dimensions. Specifically, we prove nearly tight agnostic sample complexity bounds that, up to log factors, take the form $\frac{DS^{1.5}}ε + \frac{Nat}{ε^2}$ where $ε$ is the excess risk. This bound is tight up to a $\sqrt{DS}$ factor in the first term, nearly matching known $Nat/ε^2$ and $DS/ε$ lower bounds. The first term reflects the DS-controlled regime, while the second shows that the Natarajan dimension still dictates asymptotic behavior for small $ε$. Thus, unlike binary or online classification -- where a single dimension (VC or Littlestone) controls both phenomena -- multiclass learning inherently involves two structural parameters. Our technical approach departs from traditional agnostic learning methods based on uniform convergence or reductions to realizable cases. A key ingredient is a novel online procedure based on a self-adaptive multiplicative-weights algorithm performing a label-space reduction, which may be of independent interest.

Conclusion: FLClear能同时实现无碰撞水印聚合、增强水印安全性和直观的所有权验证，有效保护联邦学习中客户端的知识产权。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared global model while preserving the privacy of their local data. Within this paradigm, the intellectual property rights (IPR) of client models are critical assets that must be protected. In practice, the central server responsible for maintaining the global model may maliciously manipulate the global model to erase client contributions or falsely claim sole ownership, thereby infringing on clients' IPR. Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for asserting model ownership and protecting intellectual property. However, existing FL watermarking approaches remain limited, suffering from potential watermark collisions among clients, insufficient watermark security, and non-intuitive verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FLClear, a novel framework that simultaneously achieves collision-free watermark aggregation, enhanced watermark security, and visually interpretable ownership verification. Specifically, FLClear introduces a transposed model jointly optimized with contrastive learning to integrate the watermarking and main task objectives. During verification, the watermark is reconstructed from the transposed model and evaluated through both visual inspection and structural similarity metrics, enabling intuitive and quantitative ownership verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted over various datasets, aggregation schemes, and attack scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FLClear and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL watermarking methods.

Abstract: Weather prediction is a quintessential problem involving the forecasting of a complex, nonlinear, and chaotic high-dimensional dynamical system. This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.

Conclusion: LP-FT通过缓解联邦特征扭曲现象，在部分特征重叠和协变量-概念偏移等条件下优于标准微调，为联邦学习中的鲁棒个性化提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized, privacy-preserving model training but struggles to balance global generalization and local personalization due to non-identical data distributions across clients. Personalized Fine-Tuning (PFT), a popular post-hoc solution, fine-tunes the final global model locally but often overfits to skewed client distributions or fails under domain shifts. We propose adapting Linear Probing followed by full Fine-Tuning (LP-FT), a principled centralized strategy for alleviating feature distortion (Kumar et al., 2022), to the FL setting. Through systematic evaluation across seven datasets and six PFT variants, we demonstrate LP-FT's superiority in balancing personalization and generalization. Our analysis uncovers federated feature distortion, a phenomenon where local fine-tuning destabilizes globally learned features, and theoretically characterizes how LP-FT mitigates this via phased parameter updates. We further establish conditions (e.g., partial feature overlap, covariate-concept shift) under which LP-FT outperforms standard fine-tuning, offering actionable guidelines for deploying robust personalization in FL.

Abstract: Training general agents to follow complex instructions (tasks) in intricate environments (levels) remains a core challenge in reinforcement learning. Random sampling of task-level pairs often produces unsolvable combinations, highlighting the need to co-design tasks and levels. While unsupervised environment design (UED) has proven effective at automatically designing level curricula, prior work has only considered a fixed task. We present ATLAS (Aligning Tasks and Levels for Autocurricula of Specifications), a novel method that generates joint autocurricula over tasks and levels. Our approach builds upon UED to automatically produce solvable yet challenging task-level pairs for policy training. To evaluate ATLAS and drive progress in the field, we introduce an evaluation suite that models tasks as reward machines in Minigrid levels. Experiments demonstrate that ATLAS vastly outperforms random sampling approaches, particularly when sampling solvable pairs is unlikely. We further show that mutations leveraging the structure of both tasks and levels accelerate convergence to performant policies.

Conclusion: AdaMeshNet通过自适应重连过程成功解决了网格GNN中的过压缩问题，更好地模拟了物理相互作用的渐进传播特性。

Abstract: Mesh-based simulation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been recognized as a promising approach for modeling fluid dynamics. However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.

Abstract: Bipartite learning is a machine learning task that aims to predict interactions between pairs of instances. It has been applied to various domains, including drug-target interactions, RNA-disease associations, and regulatory network inference. Despite being widely investigated, current methods still present drawbacks, as they are often designed for a specific application and thus do not generalize to other problems or present scalability issues. To address these challenges, we propose Oxytrees: proxy-based biclustering model trees. Oxytrees compress the interaction matrix into row- and column-wise proxy matrices, significantly reducing training time without compromising predictive performance. We also propose a new leaf-assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the time taken for prediction. Finally, Oxytrees employ linear models using the Kronecker product kernel in their leaves, resulting in shallower trees and thus even faster training. Using 15 datasets, we compared the predictive performance of ensembles of Oxytrees with that of the current state-of-the-art. We achieved up to 30-fold improvement in training times compared to state-of-the-art biclustering forests, while demonstrating competitive or superior performance in most evaluation settings, particularly in the inductive setting. Finally, we provide an intuitive Python API to access all datasets, methods and evaluation measures used in this work, thus enabling reproducible research in this field.

### [666] [On Robustness of Linear Classifiers to Targeted Data Poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12722)
*Nakshatra Gupta,Sumanth Prabhu,Supratik Chakraborty,R Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种评估训练数据集对标签污染攻击鲁棒性的方法，通过计算鲁棒性的上下界来检测数据中毒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据中毒攻击会破坏学习模型的可信度，而手动检测中毒数据在大型训练数据集中很困难，因此需要自动评估数据集对这类攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能高效计算多个公开数据集的鲁棒性边界，当污染超过识别边界时会显著影响测试点分类，且在现有技术失败的情况下仍能计算边界。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效评估数据集对标签污染攻击的鲁棒性，为检测数据中毒攻击提供了实用的自动化工具。

Abstract: Data poisoning is a training-time attack that undermines the trustworthiness of learned models. In a targeted data poisoning attack, an adversary manipulates the training dataset to alter the classification of a targeted test point. Given the typically large size of training dataset, manual detection of poisoning is difficult. An alternative is to automatically measure a dataset's robustness against such an attack, which is the focus of this paper. We consider a threat model wherein an adversary can only perturb the labels of the training dataset, with knowledge limited to the hypothesis space of the victim's model. In this setting, we prove that finding the robustness is an NP-Complete problem, even when hypotheses are linear classifiers. To overcome this, we present a technique that finds lower and upper bounds of robustness. Our implementation of the technique computes these bounds efficiently in practice for many publicly available datasets. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, a poisoning exceeding the identified robustness bounds significantly impacts test point classification. We are also able to compute these bounds in many more cases where state-of-the-art techniques fail.

### [667] [LAYA: Layer-wise Attention Aggregation for Interpretable Depth-Aware Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12723)
*Gennaro Vessio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LAYA（层间注意力聚合器），一种新颖的输出头，通过注意力机制动态聚合神经网络中间层的表示，而不是仅使用最后一层表示进行预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络仅依赖最后一层隐藏表示进行预测，但中间层包含从低层模式到高层抽象的丰富互补信息，这些信息通常被丢弃。

Method: LAYA学习输入条件化的注意力权重，对层间特征进行动态聚合，形成可解释且架构无关的预测机制。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，LAYA始终匹配或优于标准输出头，准确率相对提升约1个百分点，同时提供明确的层归因分数。

Conclusion: LAYA不仅提升了性能，还直接从模型计算中产生可解释性信号，无需外部事后解释方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically rely on the representation produced by their final hidden layer to make predictions, implicitly assuming that this single vector fully captures the semantics encoded across all preceding transformations. However, intermediate layers contain rich and complementary information -- ranging from low-level patterns to high-level abstractions -- that is often discarded when the decision head depends solely on the last representation. This paper revisits the role of the output layer and introduces LAYA (Layer-wise Attention Aggregator), a novel output head that dynamically aggregates internal representations through attention. Instead of projecting only the deepest embedding, LAYA learns input-conditioned attention weights over layer-wise features, yielding an interpretable and architecture-agnostic mechanism for synthesizing predictions. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that LAYA consistently matches or improves the performance of standard output heads, with relative gains of up to about one percentage point in accuracy, while providing explicit layer-attribution scores that reveal how different abstraction levels contribute to each decision. Crucially, these interpretability signals emerge directly from the model's computation, without any external post hoc explanations. The code to reproduce LAYA is publicly available at: https://github.com/gvessio/LAYA.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理图像的各种变形，提供平滑且可微的函数近似，并具有理论上的收敛保证。

Abstract: A method for creating a forest of model trees to fit samples of a function defined on images is described in several steps: down-sampling the images, determining a tree's hyperplanes, applying convolutions to the hyperplanes to handle small distortions of training images, and creating forests of model trees to increase accuracy and achieve a smooth fit. A 1-to-1 correspondence among pixels of images, coefficients of hyperplanes and coefficients of leaf functions offers the possibility of dealing with larger distortions such as arbitrary rotations or changes of perspective. A theoretical method for smoothing forest outputs to produce a continuously differentiable approximation is described. Within that framework, a training procedure is proved to converge.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为潜在空间过滤（LSF）的新方法，通过过滤混合数据集中不太真实的合成数据来缓解模型崩溃问题，无需增加训练成本或依赖人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成数据在互联网上的扩散，它们经常被用来训练后续几代生成模型，形成了"自消耗循环"，可能导致训练不稳定或模型崩溃。现有的解决方案要么增加计算成本，要么需要昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 通过分析自消耗扩散模型的潜在空间动态，发现合成数据的低维潜在表示结构会随着代际退化。基于这一洞察，提出了潜在空间过滤（LSF）方法，从混合数据集中过滤掉不太真实的合成数据。

Result: 实验表明，LSF在多个真实世界数据集上持续优于现有基线方法，有效缓解了模型崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 潜在空间过滤是一种有效的解决方案，能够在不增加训练成本或依赖人工标注的情况下缓解模型崩溃问题。

Abstract: As synthetic data proliferates across the Internet, it is often reused to train successive generations of generative models. This creates a ``self-consuming loop" that can lead to training instability or \textit{model collapse}. Common strategies to address the issue -- such as accumulating historical training data or injecting fresh real data -- either increase computational cost or require expensive human annotation. In this paper, we empirically analyze the latent space dynamics of self-consuming diffusion models and observe that the low-dimensional structure of latent representations extracted from synthetic data degrade over generations. Based on this insight, we propose \textit{Latent Space Filtering} (LSF), a novel approach that mitigates model collapse by filtering out less realistic synthetic data from mixed datasets. Theoretically, we present a framework that connects latent space degradation to empirical observations. Experimentally, we show that LSF consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple real-world datasets, effectively mitigating model collapse without increasing training cost or relying on human annotation.

TL;DR: DIVIDE框架通过结合机制特定的深度编码器和结构化高斯过程，分离科学数据集中多个独立机制的影响，实现可解释的机制感知预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据集通常来自多个独立机制（如空间、分类或结构效应）的组合影响，这些影响的混合掩盖了各自的贡献，需要分离这些机制来理解其独立作用。

Method: 集成机制特定的深度编码器与结构化高斯过程在联合潜在空间中，编码器分离不同机制，高斯过程捕捉其组合效应并校准不确定性，支持结构化先验。

Result: 在合成数据集、FerroSIM铁电模式模拟和PbTiO3薄膜实验PFM磁滞回线上，DIVIDE成功分离机制，重现加性和缩放相互作用，并在噪声下保持稳健。

Conclusion: DIVIDE框架能有效分离科学数据中的独立机制，支持可解释预测和高效主动学习，可自然扩展到多功能数据集。

Abstract: Scientific datasets often arise from multiple independent mechanisms such as spatial, categorical or structural effects, whose combined influence obscures their individual contributions. We introduce DIVIDE, a framework that disentangles these influences by integrating mechanism-specific deep encoders with a structured Gaussian Process in a joint latent space. Disentanglement here refers to separating independently acting generative factors. The encoders isolate distinct mechanisms while the Gaussian Process captures their combined effect with calibrated uncertainty. The architecture supports structured priors, enabling interpretable and mechanism-aware prediction as well as efficient active learning. DIVIDE is demonstrated on synthetic datasets combining categorical image patches with nonlinear spatial fields, on FerroSIM spin lattice simulations of ferroelectric patterns, and on experimental PFM hysteresis loops from PbTiO3 films. Across benchmarks, DIVIDE separates mechanisms, reproduces additive and scaled interactions, and remains robust under noise. The framework extends naturally to multifunctional datasets where mechanical, electromagnetic or optical responses coexist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL在复杂驾驶场景中奖励函数难以完全捕捉语义和社会复杂性，以及LLM直接控制存在稳定性、一致性和延迟问题，探索小型LLM通过奖励塑造辅助RL的可行性。

Method: 采用案例研究方法，比较纯RL、纯LLM和混合方法。在混合方法中，LLM通过在训练期间对状态-动作转移进行评分来增强RL奖励，而测试时仍使用标准RL策略执行。

Result: 纯RL代理成功率73-89%，效率合理；纯LLM代理成功率可达94%但速度性能严重下降；混合方法介于两者之间。LLM影响的方法表现出系统性保守偏差和显著的模型依赖性变异。

Conclusion: 当前小型LLM在安全关键控制任务中存在重要局限性，尽管能提高成功率，但会导致保守行为和效率下降，不适合直接用于安全关键控制。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks.

Motivation: 为了解决非线性动力系统中Koopman不变表示的自适应更新问题，防止过拟合并减少不必要的模型更新。

Method: 结合深度特征学习和提升空间中的多步预测一致性，采用符合性机制评估当前Koopman模型的一致性，仅在预测误差超过动态阈值时触发更新。

Result: 在基准动力系统上的实证结果表明，COLoKe能保持长期预测准确性，同时显著减少不必要更新并避免过拟合。

Conclusion: COLoKe框架有效实现了非线性动力系统Koopman嵌入的自适应学习，在保持预测精度的同时优化了更新效率。

Abstract: We introduce Conformal Online Learning of Koopman embeddings (COLoKe), a novel framework for adaptively updating Koopman-invariant representations of nonlinear dynamical systems from streaming data. Our modeling approach combines deep feature learning with multistep prediction consistency in the lifted space, where the dynamics evolve linearly. To prevent overfitting, COLoKe employs a conformal-style mechanism that shifts the focus from evaluating the conformity of new states to assessing the consistency of the current Koopman model. Updates are triggered only when the current model's prediction error exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold, allowing selective refinement of the Koopman operator and embedding. Empirical results on benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate the effectiveness of COLoKe in maintaining long-term predictive accuracy while significantly reducing unnecessary updates and avoiding overfitting.

Conclusion: INC通过形式化误差减少实现了稳定高效的PDE仿真，为具有可靠物理保证的更快科学和工程模拟铺平了道路。

Abstract: When simulating partial differential equations, hybrid solvers combine coarse numerical solvers with learned correctors. They promise accelerated simulations while adhering to physical constraints. However, as shown in our theoretical framework, directly applying learned corrections to solver outputs leads to significant autoregressive errors, which originate from amplified perturbations that accumulate during long-term rollouts, especially in chaotic regimes. To overcome this, we propose the Indirect Neural Corrector (\(\mathrm{INC}\)), which integrates learned corrections into the governing equations rather than applying direct state updates. Our key insight is that \(\mathrm{INC}\) reduces the error amplification on the order of \(Δt^{-1} + L\), where \(Δt\) is the timestep and $L$ the Lipschitz constant. At the same time, our framework poses no architectural requirements and integrates seamlessly with arbitrary neural networks and solvers. We test \(\mathrm{INC}\) in extensive benchmarks, covering numerous differentiable solvers, neural backbones, and test cases ranging from a 1D chaotic system to 3D turbulence. INC improves the long-term trajectory performance (\(R^2\)) by up to 158.7\%, stabilizes blowups under aggressive coarsening, and for complex 3D turbulence cases yields speed-ups of several orders of magnitude. INC thus enables stable, efficient PDE emulation with formal error reduction, paving the way for faster scientific and engineering simulations with reliable physics guarantees.

Abstract: Understanding and continuously refining multimodal molecular knowledge is crucial for advancing biomedicine, chemistry, and materials science. Molecule language models (MoLMs) have become powerful tools in these domains, integrating structural representations (e.g., SMILES strings, molecular graphs) with rich contextual descriptions (e.g., physicochemical properties). However, MoLMs can encode and propagate inaccuracies due to outdated web-mined training corpora or malicious manipulation, jeopardizing downstream discovery pipelines. While knowledge editing has been explored for general-domain AI, its application to MoLMs remains uncharted, presenting unique challenges due to the multifaceted and interdependent nature of molecular knowledge. In this paper, we take the first step toward MoLM editing for two critical tasks: molecule-to-caption generation and caption-to-molecule generation. To address molecule-specific challenges, we propose MolEdit, a powerful framework that enables targeted modifications while preserving unrelated molecular knowledge. MolEdit combines a Multi-Expert Knowledge Adapter that routes edits to specialized experts for different molecular facets with an Expertise-Aware Editing Switcher that activates the adapters only when input closely matches the stored edits across all expertise, minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. To systematically evaluate editing performance, we introduce MEBench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing multiple dimensions, including Reliability (accuracy of the editing), Locality (preservation of irrelevant knowledge), and Generality (robustness to reformed queries). Across extensive experiments on two popular MoLM backbones, MolEdit delivers up to 18.8% higher Reliability and 12.0% better Locality than baselines while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently estimating policies that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). Given $n$ objectives (or tasks), we seek the optimal partition of these objectives into $k \ll n$ groups, where each group comprises related objectives that can be trained together. This problem arises in applications such as robotics, control, and preference optimization in language models, where learning a single policy for all $n$ objectives is suboptimal as $n$ grows. We introduce a two-stage procedure -- meta-training followed by fine-tuning -- to address this problem. We first learn a meta-policy for all objectives using multitask learning. Then, we adapt the meta-policy to multiple randomly sampled subsets of objectives. The adaptation step leverages a first-order approximation property of well-trained policy networks, which is empirically verified to be accurate within a $2\%$ error margin across various RL environments. The resulting algorithm, PolicyGradEx, efficiently estimates an aggregate task-affinity score matrix given a policy evaluation algorithm. Based on the estimated affinity score matrix, we cluster the $n$ objectives into $k$ groups by maximizing the intra-cluster affinity scores. Experiments on three robotic control and the Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $16\%$ on average, while delivering up to $26\times$ faster speedup relative to performing full training to obtain the clusters. Ablation studies validate each component of our approach. For instance, compared with random grouping and gradient-similarity-based grouping, our loss-based clustering yields an improvement of $19\%$. Finally, we analyze the generalization error of policy networks by measuring the Hessian trace of the loss surface, which gives non-vacuous measures relative to the observed generalization errors.

Abstract: The semiconductor industry faces a computational crisis in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography optimization, where traditional methods consume billions of CPU hours while failing to achieve sub-nanometer precision. We present a physics-constrained adaptive learning framework that automatically calibrates electromagnetic approximations through learnable parameters $\boldsymbolθ = \{θ_d, θ_a, θ_b, θ_p, θ_c\}$ while simultaneously minimizing Edge Placement Error (EPE) between simulated aerial images and target photomasks. The framework integrates differentiable modules for Fresnel diffraction, material absorption, optical point spread function blur, phase-shift effects, and contrast modulation with direct geometric pattern matching objectives, enabling cross-geometry generalization with minimal training data. Through physics-constrained learning on 15 representative patterns spanning current production to future research nodes, we demonstrate consistent sub-nanometer EPE performance (0.664-2.536 nm range) using only 50 training samples per pattern. Adaptive physics learning achieves an average improvement of 69.9\% over CNN baselines without physics constraints, with a significant inference speedup over rigorous electromagnetic solvers after training completion. This approach requires 90\% fewer training samples through cross-geometry generalization compared to pattern-specific CNN training approaches. This work establishes physics-constrained adaptive learning as a foundational methodology for real-time semiconductor manufacturing optimization, addressing the critical gap between academic physics-informed neural networks and industrial deployment requirements through joint physics calibration and manufacturing precision objectives.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate look-back horizon remains a fundamental challenge in time series forecasting (TSF), particularly in the federated learning scenarios where data is decentralized, heterogeneous, and often non-independent. While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) -- the capacity of a model to infer and apply abstract patterns from examples provided within its input -- has been extensively studied in large language models trained for next-token prediction on human text. In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?
  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.

TL;DR: 本文首次为自消费生成模型的递归再训练对对齐的长期影响提供了形式化分析框架，揭示了三种收敛机制，并证明了基于Bradley-Terry的筛选机制无法同时保持多样性、对称影响和消除初始化依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自消费生成模型中，模型在自身输出上训练，使得与用户偏好的对齐成为一个递归而非一次性过程。需要分析这种递归再训练对对齐的长期影响。

Method: 采用基于Bradley-Terry模型的两阶段筛选机制，将对齐建模为模型所有者和公共用户两个派系之间的交互，分析不同偏好对齐程度下的收敛机制。

Result: 发现了三种结构性收敛机制：共识崩溃、共享最优妥协和不对称精炼。证明了基于BT的递归筛选机制无法同时满足多样性保持、对称影响和初始化独立性。

Conclusion: 对齐不是静态目标而是演化均衡，既受权力不对称影响，也受路径依赖影响。需要将对齐过程视为动态社会选择问题。

Abstract: In self-consuming generative models that train on their own outputs, alignment with user preferences becomes a recursive rather than one-time process. We provide the first formal foundation for analyzing the long-term effects of such recursive retraining on alignment. Under a two-stage curation mechanism based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, we model alignment as an interaction between two factions: the Model Owner, who filters which outputs should be learned by the model, and the Public User, who determines which outputs are ultimately shared and retained through interactions with the model. Our analysis reveals three structural convergence regimes depending on the degree of preference alignment: consensus collapse, compromise on shared optima, and asymmetric refinement. We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: no recursive BT-based curation mechanism can simultaneously preserve diversity, ensure symmetric influence, and eliminate dependence on initialization. Framing the process as dynamic social choice, we show that alignment is not a static goal but an evolving equilibrium, shaped both by power asymmetries and path dependence.

TL;DR: 使用定量线性时序逻辑(LTL_f[F])合成奖励监视器，为可观测状态轨迹生成密集奖励流，解决稀疏奖励问题，提升强化学习训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中，设计信息丰富且密集的奖励函数是一个关键挑战，直接影响智能体训练效率。当前文献中主导的布尔语义会导致长时决策中的稀疏奖励问题。

Method: 利用定量线性时序逻辑在有限轨迹上的表达能力，合成奖励监视器，生成密集奖励流。该框架与算法无关，仅依赖状态标记函数，自然支持非马尔可夫性质的规范。

Result: 实证结果表明，定量监视器始终优于布尔监视器，在最大化任务完成度的定量度量方面表现更好，并能减少收敛时间，具体效果取决于环境。

Conclusion: 定量线性时序逻辑为强化学习提供了有效的密集奖励生成框架，能够显著改善长时决策中的稀疏奖励问题，提升训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Specifying informative and dense reward functions remains a pivotal challenge in Reinforcement Learning, as it directly affects the efficiency of agent training. In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\text{LTL}_f[\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties. Empirical results show that our quantitative monitors consistently subsume and, depending on the environment, outperform Boolean monitors in maximizing a quantitative measure of task completion and in reducing convergence time.

Conclusion: 尽管存在局限性，但利用知识图谱是医疗领域自动事实性评估的重要方向，其可解释性有助于理解和缓解当前LLM的局限。

Abstract: The recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs) holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare, with strong capabilities in diverse medical tasks. Yet, deploying LLMs in high-stakes healthcare settings requires rigorous verification and validation to understand any potential harm. This paper investigates the reliability and viability of using medical knowledge graphs (KGs) for the automated factuality evaluation of LLM-generated responses. To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities. It is also robust to textual variances. The inherent explainability of its scoring can further help users understand and mitigate the limitations of current LLMs. We conclude that while limitations exist, leveraging KGs is a prominent direction for automated factuality assessment in healthcare.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了KANs在持续学习中的优势和局限性，为持续学习系统设计提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a longstanding challenge in continual learning, where models lose knowledge from earlier tasks when learning new ones. While various mitigation strategies have been proposed for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), recent architectural advances like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been suggested to offer intrinsic resistance to forgetting by leveraging localized spline-based activations. However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension. We validate these analyses through systematic experiments on synthetic and vision tasks, measuring forgetting dynamics under varying model configurations and data complexity. Further, we introduce KAN-LoRA, a novel adapter design for parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of language models, and evaluate its effectiveness in knowledge editing tasks. Our findings reveal that while KANs exhibit promising retention in low-dimensional algorithmic settings, they remain vulnerable to forgetting in high-dimensional domains such as image classification and language modeling. These results advance the understanding of KANs' strengths and limitations, offering practical insights for continual learning system design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Co-Sparsify是一个连接感知的稀疏化框架，通过将2节点消息传递限制在连通组件中，3节点交互限制在双连通组件中，在保持2-FWL表达能力的同时消除冗余计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高阶图神经网络（HOGNNs）基于2-FWL测试，虽然表达能力更强但计算成本高达O(n³)。现有的效率优化方法通常以降低表达能力为代价来缓解计算负担。

Method: Co-Sparsify框架的关键洞察是：3节点交互仅在双连通组件（每个节点对都在环上的最大子图）中具有表达必要性。在这些组件之外，结构关系可以通过2节点消息传递或全局读取完全捕获。

Result: 在PPGN上，Co-Sparsify在合成子结构计数任务中匹配或超过准确率，在真实世界基准（ZINC, QM9）上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明高表达能力和可扩展性并不相互排斥：基于原理的拓扑引导稀疏化能够实现具有理论保证的强大高效GNNs。

Abstract: Higher-order Graph Neural Networks (HOGNNs) based on the 2-FWL test achieve superior expressivity by modeling 2- and 3-node interactions, but at $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ computational cost. However, this computational burden is typically mitigated by existing efficiency methods at the cost of reduced expressivity. We propose \textbf{Co-Sparsify}, a connectivity-aware sparsification framework that eliminates \emph{provably redundant} computations while preserving full 2-FWL expressive power. Our key insight is that 3-node interactions are expressively necessary only within \emph{biconnected components} -- maximal subgraphs where every pair of nodes lies on a cycle. Outside these components, structural relationships can be fully captured via 2-node message passing or global readout, rendering higher-order modeling unnecessary. Co-Sparsify restricts 2-node message passing to connected components and 3-node interactions to biconnected ones, removing computation without approximation or sampling. We prove that Co-Sparsified GNNs are as expressive as the 2-FWL test. Empirically, on PPGN, Co-Sparsify matches or exceeds accuracy on synthetic substructure counting tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks (ZINC, QM9). This study demonstrates that high expressivity and scalability are not mutually exclusive: principled, topology-guided sparsification enables powerful, efficient GNNs with theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线变化检测方法假设精确系统知识，这在实际中不现实，且在大规模系统中效率低下。

Method: 通过紧密松弛和重构OCD优化问题，采用神经展开实现GPU加速的并行计算。

Result: 实验验证了RoS-Guard的有效性，并在大规模系统场景中显示出显著的计算加速。

Conclusion: RoS-Guard解决了现有OCD方法在鲁棒性和效率方面的局限性，为具有不确定性的线性系统提供了理论保证的高效变化检测方案。

Abstract: Online change detection (OCD) aims to rapidly identify change points in streaming data and is critical in applications such as power system monitoring, wireless network sensing, and financial anomaly detection. Existing OCD methods typically assume precise system knowledge, which is unrealistic due to estimation errors and environmental variations. Moreover, existing OCD methods often struggle with efficiency in large-scale systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose RoS-Guard, a robust and optimal OCD algorithm tailored for linear systems with uncertainty. Through a tight relaxation and reformulation of the OCD optimization problem, RoS-Guard employs neural unrolling to enable efficient parallel computation via GPU acceleration. The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees on performance, including expected false alarm rate and worst-case average detection delay. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoS-Guard and demonstrate significant computational speedup in large-scale system scenarios.

Motivation: 深度神经网络虽然性能优异但难以进行机制性解释，需要一种系统性的方法来分析网络内部计算过程。

Method: 对于给定输入，在对应的隐藏激活模式周围线性化网络，构建状态空间模型，状态由隐藏神经元激活组成。通过输入状态和状态输出Jacobians定义局部可控性和可观测性Gramians，计算Hankel奇异值和相关模式。

Result: 在简单前馈网络上验证了该框架，包括1-2-2-1 SwiGLU网络和2-3-3-2 GELU网络。通过比较不同操作点，展示了激活饱和如何降低可控性、缩小主导Hankel奇异值，并将主导内部模式转移到不同的神经元子集。

Conclusion: 该方法将神经网络转化为局部白盒动态模型集合，并指出了哪些内部方向是剪枝或约束的自然候选，以提高可解释性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve state of the art performance but remain difficult to interpret mechanistically. In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability.

Result: DDQN在大型或高度不确定环境中优于传统策略，表现出更优的计算能力、策略可靠性和适应性，能够获得更高的期望NPV。

Conclusion: DDQN不仅能在复杂项目优化中实现更高的期望NPV，还提供了一个稳定有效的策略实施框架，双网络架构和目标网络对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: This paper investigates a project with stochastic activity durations and cash flows under discrete scenarios, where activities must satisfy precedence constraints generating cash inflows and outflows. The objective is to maximize expected net present value (NPV) by accelerating inflows and deferring outflows. We formulate the problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) approach. Comparative experiments demonstrate that DDQN outperforms traditional rigid and dynamic strategies, particularly in large-scale or highly uncertain environments, exhibiting superior computational capability, policy reliability, and adaptability. Ablation studies further reveal that the dual-network architecture mitigates overestimation of action values, while the target network substantially improves training convergence and robustness. These results indicate that DDQN not only achieves higher expected NPV in complex project optimization but also provides a reliable framework for stable and effective policy implementation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的理论框架，从计算性、信息论和几何约束角度系统分析了LLM扩展的五大基本限制：幻觉、上下文压缩、推理退化、检索脆弱性和多模态不对齐，并提供了理论证明和缓解路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM扩展限制多停留在经验描述层面，缺乏连接计算、信息和学习基础理论的严谨理论综合。本文旨在填补这一空白，为LLM扩展的内在理论上限提供统一框架。

Method: 采用证明驱动的统一框架，从三个理论维度分析：计算性与不可计算性导致固有错误；信息论和统计约束限制可达精度；几何和计算效应导致上下文压缩。结合定理证明和实证证据。

Result: 证明了LLM扩展存在根本性理论天花板：计算性限制导致不可约错误；信息论约束限制准确性；几何效应压缩上下文；基于似然的训练偏好模式完成而非推理；检索受语义漂移影响；多模态扩展仅实现浅层对齐。

Conclusion: LLM扩展在某些领域有效，但在特定任务上会饱和或无法进展。提出了有界检索、位置课程、稀疏注意力等实用缓解路径，为理解LLM能力边界提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.

Conclusion: Wasserstein距离能够有效捕捉点态密度差异，并将这些信息与支撑差异相协调，在有限样本设置下具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: Leveraging the Wasserstein distance -- a summation of sample-wise transport distances in data space -- is advantageous in many applications for measuring support differences between two underlying density functions. However, when supports significantly overlap while densities exhibit substantial pointwise differences, it remains unclear whether and how this transport information can accurately identify these differences, particularly their analytic characterization in finite-sample settings. We address this issue by conducting an analysis of the information processing capabilities of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance with finite samples. By utilizing the Poisson process and isolating the rate factor, we demonstrate the capability of capturing the pointwise density difference with Wasserstein distances and how this information harmonizes with support differences. The analyzed properties are confirmed using neural spike train decoding and amino acid contact frequency data. The results reveal that the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance highlights meaningful density differences related to both rate and support.

Abstract: Training neural operators to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces often requires extensive datasets generated by either demanding experimental setups or computationally expensive numerical solvers. This dependence on solver-based data limits scalability and constrains exploration across physical systems. Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training.

Abstract: This paper studies the interpretability of neural network features from a Bayesian Gaussian view, where optimizing a cost is reaching a probabilistic bound; learning a model approximates a density that makes the bound tight and the cost optimal, often with a Gaussian mixture density. The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle.
  We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs.
  Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively.

Abstract: In industrial recommendation systems, pre-ranking models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) commonly adopt a sequential execution framework: feature fetching and model forward computation are triggered only after receiving candidates from the upstream retrieval stage. This design introduces inherent bottlenecks, including redundant computations of identical users/items and increased latency due to strictly sequential operations, which jointly constrain the model's capacity and system efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Asynchronous Inference Framework (AIF), a cost-effective computational architecture that decouples interaction-independent components, those operating within a single user or item, from real-time prediction. AIF reorganizes the model inference process by performing user-side computations in parallel with the retrieval stage and conducting item-side computations in a nearline manner. This means that interaction-independent components are calculated just once and completed before the real-time prediction phase of the pre-ranking stage. As a result, AIF enhances computational efficiency and reduces latency, freeing up resources to significantly improve the feature set and model architecture of interaction-independent components. Moreover, we delve into model design within the AIF framework, employing approximated methods for interaction-dependent components in online real-time predictions. By co-designing both the framework and the model, our solution achieves notable performance gains without significantly increasing computational and latency costs. This has enabled the successful deployment of AIF in the Taobao display advertising system.

TL;DR: APT是一种轻量级插件模块，通过时间戳条件原型学习动态生成仿射参数，将全局分布特征注入归一化-预测流程，显著提升分布偏移下的时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖局部统计归一化，无法捕捉全局分布偏移；RevIN等方法在缺失值、噪声观测和无效通道仿射变换方面仍存在困难。

Method: 提出APT模块，利用时间戳条件原型学习动态生成仿射参数，调制输入和输出序列，使主干网络能从自监督的分布感知聚类实例中学习。

Result: 在六个基准数据集和多种主干-归一化组合上的广泛实验表明，APT显著提高了分布偏移下的预测性能。

Conclusion: APT是一个轻量灵活、与任意预测主干和归一化策略兼容的插件模块，在分布偏移场景下能有效提升时间序列预测效果。

Abstract: Time series forecasting under distribution shift remains challenging, as existing deep learning models often rely on local statistical normalization (e.g., mean and variance) that fails to capture global distribution shift. Methods like RevIN and its variants attempt to decouple distribution and pattern but still struggle with missing values, noisy observations, and invalid channel-wise affine transformation. To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances. APT is compatible with arbitrary forecasting backbones and normalization strategies while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets and multiple backbone-normalization combinations demonstrate that APT significantly improves forecasting performance under distribution shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场波动性强，传统深度学习模型难以捕捉长期依赖和复杂周期模式，需要更有效的异常检测和风险预测方法

Method: 集成频率增强分解Transformer(FEDformer)、基于残差的异常检测器和风险预测头，在时域和频域建模时间动态，分解趋势和季节成分

Result: 在S&P 500、NASDAQ和布伦特原油数据集上测试，RMSE降低15.7%，异常检测F1分数提升11.5%

Conclusion: 该模型能有效捕捉金融波动性，为市场崩盘预测和风险管理提供可靠的早期预警系统

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently volatile and prone to sudden disruptions such as market crashes, flash collapses, and liquidity crises. Accurate anomaly detection and early risk forecasting in financial time series are therefore crucial for preventing systemic instability and supporting informed investment decisions. Traditional deep learning models, such as LSTM and GRU, often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex periodic patterns in highly nonstationary financial data. To address this limitation, this study proposes a FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series, which integrates the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer) with a residual-based anomaly detector and a risk forecasting head. The FEDformer module models temporal dynamics in both time and frequency domains, decomposing signals into trend and seasonal components for improved interpretability. The residual-based detector identifies abnormal fluctuations by analyzing prediction errors, while the risk head predicts potential financial distress using learned latent embeddings. Experiments conducted on the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Brent Crude Oil datasets (2000-2024) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over benchmark methods, achieving a 15.7 percent reduction in RMSE and an 11.5 percent improvement in F1-score for anomaly detection. These results confirm the effectiveness of the model in capturing financial volatility, enabling reliable early-warning systems for market crash prediction and risk management.

Conclusion: 改进基于transformer的架构为太阳耀斑预测任务提供了一个高潜力的替代方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series classification is increasingly investigated in space weather research as a means to predict intense solar flare events, which can cause widespread disruptions across modern technological systems. Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical paradigm for building reliable, knowledge-intensive Large Language Model (LLM) applications. However, the multi-stage pipeline (retrieve, generate) and unique workload characteristics (e.g., knowledge dependency) of RAG systems pose significant challenges for serving performance optimization. Existing generic LLM inference traces fail to capture these RAG-specific dynamics, creating a significant performance gap between academic research and real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RAGPulse, an open-source RAG workload trace dataset. This dataset was collected from an university-wide Q&A system serving that has served more than 40,000 students and faculties since April 2024. We detail RAGPulse's system architecture, its privacy-preserving hash-based data format, and provide an in-depth statistical analysis. Our analysis reveals that real-world RAG workloads exhibit significant temporal locality and a highly skewed hot document access pattern. RAGPulse provides a high-fidelity foundation for researchers to develop and validate novel optimization strategies for RAG systems, such as content-aware batching and retrieval caching, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of RAG services.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对双曲网络的几何感知对抗攻击方法，通过利用双曲空间的几何特性，在切空间中分解梯度为径向和角度分量，仅从角度方向生成扰动，从而更有效地攻击双曲嵌入。

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法如FGSM和PGD未考虑双曲网络的非欧几何结构，可能导致效率低下或几何不一致的攻击，需要在曲率表示空间中重新评估攻击策略。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在曲率表示空间中几何感知对抗策略的重要性，并为攻击层次嵌入提供了一个原则性框架。

Abstract: Adversarial examples in neural networks have been extensively studied in Euclidean geometry, but recent advances in \textit{hyperbolic networks} call for a reevaluation of attack strategies in non-Euclidean geometries. Existing methods such as FGSM and PGD apply perturbations without regard to the underlying hyperbolic structure, potentially leading to inefficient or geometrically inconsistent attacks. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack that explicitly leverages the geometric properties of hyperbolic space. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the loss function in the tangent space of hyperbolic space, decompose it into a radial (depth) component and an angular (semantic) component, and apply perturbation derived solely from the angular direction. Our method generates adversarial examples by focusing perturbations in semantically sensitive directions encoded in angular movement within the hyperbolic geometry. Empirical results on image classification, cross-modal retrieval tasks and network architectures demonstrate that our attack achieves higher fooling rates than conventional adversarial attacks, while producing high-impact perturbations with deeper insights into vulnerabilities of hyperbolic embeddings. This work highlights the importance of geometry-aware adversarial strategies in curved representation spaces and provides a principled framework for attacking hierarchical embeddings.

Conclusion: 强化学习有潜力为MILP求解器开发鲁棒且自适应的分支策略。

Abstract: Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) is the dominant exact solution method for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP), yet its exponential time complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale instances. The growing capabilities of machine learning have spurred efforts to improve B\&B by learning data-driven branching policies. However, most existing approaches rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which tends to overfit to expert demonstrations and struggles to generalize to structurally diverse or unseen instances. In this work, we propose Tree-Gate Proximal Policy Optimization (TGPPO), a novel framework that employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, to train a branching policy aimed at improving generalization across heterogeneous MILP instances. Our approach builds on a parameterized state space representation that dynamically captures the evolving context of the search tree. Empirical evaluations show that TGPPO often outperforms existing learning-based policies in terms of reducing the number of nodes explored and improving p-Primal-Dual Integrals (PDI), particularly in out-of-distribution instances. These results highlight the potential of RL to develop robust and adaptable branching strategies for MILP solvers.

Conclusion: 分形节点方法有效缓解了过压缩问题，改善了MPNN的长距离依赖建模，实现了局部效率和全局建模的良好平衡。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.

Method: 进行大规模实证研究，系统分析R-Learner在图上表现，提出端到端Graph R-Learner，并通过"Hub-Periphery Trade-off"分析揭示GNN过压缩问题。

Result: 统计显著证明(p<0.001)图盲最终阶段完全失败(MSE>4.0)，而Graph R-Learner显著优于非DML GNN T-Learner基线，并识别出拓扑依赖的"nuisance bottleneck"。

Conclusion: R-Learner在图上应用存在"最终阶段瓶颈"，最终阶段模型的图感知能力至关重要，为未来研究提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: The R-Learner is a powerful, theoretically-grounded framework for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, prized for its robustness to nuisance model errors. However, its application to network data, where causal heterogeneity is often graph-dependent, presents a critical challenge to its core assumption of a well-specified final-stage model. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to systematically dissect the R-Learner framework on graphs. We provide the first rigorous evidence that the primary driver of performance is the inductive bias of the final-stage CATE estimator, an effect that dominates the choice of nuisance models. Our central finding is the quantification of a catastrophic "representation bottleneck": we prove with overwhelming statistical significance (p < 0.001) that R-Learners with a graph-blind final stage fail completely (MSE > 4.0), even when paired with powerful GNN nuisance models. Conversely, our proposed end-to-end Graph R-Learner succeeds and significantly outperforms a strong, non-DML GNN T-Learner baseline. Furthermore, we identify and provide a mechanistic explanation for a subtle, topology-dependent "nuisance bottleneck," linking it to GNN over-squashing via a targeted "Hub-Periphery Trade-off" analysis. Our findings are validated across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. We release our code as a reproducible benchmark to facilitate future research on this critical "final-stage bottleneck."

Conclusion: 处理预处理多样性是构建可泛化神经基础模型的关键步骤，TSAP为解决时间尺度不匹配问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: General-purpose foundation models for neural time series can help accelerate neuroscientific discoveries and enable applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). A key component in scaling these models is population-level representation learning, which leverages information across channels to capture spatial as well as temporal structure. Population-level approaches have recently shown that such representations can be both efficient to learn on top of pretrained temporal encoders and produce useful representations for decoding a variety of downstream tasks. However, these models remain sensitive to mismatches in preprocessing, particularly on time-scales, between pretraining and downstream settings. We systematically examine how time-scale mismatches affects generalization and find that existing representations lack invariance. To address this, we introduce Time-scale Augmented Pretraining (TSAP), which consistently improves robustness to different time-scales across decoding tasks and builds invariance in the representation space. These results highlight handling preprocessing diversity as a key step toward building generalizable neural foundation models.

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in Small Language Models (SLMs) as resource-efficient alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to unresolved efficiency gaps in model compression. While quantization has proven effective for LLMs, its applicability to SLMs is significantly underexplored, with critical questions about differing quantization bottlenecks and efficiency profiles. This paper introduces SLMQuant, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM compression techniques when applied to SLMs. Through comprehensive multi-track evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks, we analyze how state-of-the-art quantization methods perform on SLMs. Our findings reveal fundamental disparities between SLMs and LLMs in quantization sensitivity, demonstrating that direct transfer of LLM-optimized techniques leads to suboptimal results due to SLMs' unique architectural characteristics and training dynamics. We identify key factors governing effective SLM quantization and propose actionable design principles for SLM-tailored compression. SLMQuant establishes a foundational framework for advancing efficient SLM deployment on low-end devices in edge applications, and provides critical insights for deploying lightweight language models in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a one-step generative policy for offline reinforcement learning that maps noise directly to actions via a residual reformulation of MeanFlow, making it compatible with Q-learning. While one-step Gaussian policies enable fast inference, they struggle to capture complex, multimodal action distributions. Existing flow-based methods improve expressivity but typically rely on distillation and two-stage training when trained with Q-learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate MeanFlow to enable direct noise-to-action generation by integrating the velocity field and noise-to-action transformation into a single policy network-eliminating the need for separate velocity estimation. We explore several reformulation variants and identify an effective residual formulation that supports expressive and stable policy learning. Our method offers three key advantages: 1) efficient one-step noise-to-action generation, 2) expressive modelling of multimodal action distributions, and 3) efficient and stable policy learning via Q-learning in a single-stage training setup. Extensive experiments on 73 tasks across the OGBench and D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance in both offline and offline-to-online reinforcement learning settings.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法需要大量数据，限制了在稀疏或不完整场景中的应用。图机器学习虽然提供了替代方案，但在处理知识图谱时仍面临信息隐藏的局限性。

Method: 结合Node2Vec（通过无监督随机游走捕获结构模式）和GraphSAGE（以监督方式聚合邻域信息）。首先计算Node2Vec嵌入表示图拓扑，然后用基于中心性的指标丰富节点特征作为GraphSAGE输入，最后通过融合层结合两种表示。

Conclusion: Bi-View方法通过融合拓扑和语义属性，能够利用数据集中存在但未明确表示的信息特征，有效增强知识图谱的图嵌入表示。

Abstract: Traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods require large amounts of data to perform well, limiting their applicability in sparse or incomplete scenarios and forcing the usage of additional synthetic data to improve the model training. To overcome this challenge, the research community is looking more and more at Graph Machine Learning (GML) as it offers a powerful alternative by using relationships within data. However, this method also faces limitations, particularly when dealing with Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can hide huge information due to their semantic nature. This study introduces Bi-View, a novel hybrid approach that increases the informative content of node features in KGs to generate enhanced Graph Embeddings (GEs) that are used to improve GML models without relying on additional synthetic data. The proposed work combines two complementary GE techniques: Node2Vec, which captures structural patterns through unsupervised random walks, and GraphSAGE, which aggregates neighbourhood information in a supervised way. Node2Vec embeddings are first computed to represent the graph topology, and node features are then enriched with centrality-based metrics, which are used as input for the GraphSAGE model. Moreover, a fusion layer combines the original Node2Vec embeddings with the GraphSAGE-influenced representations, resulting in a dual-perspective embedding space. Such a fusion captures both topological and semantic properties of the graph, enabling the model to exploit informative features that may exist in the dataset but that are not explicitly represented. Our approach improves downstream task performance, especially in scenarios with poor initial features, giving the basis for more accurate and precise KG-enanched GML models.

Abstract: We study a matrix completion problem where both the ground truth $R$ matrix and the unknown sampling distribution $P$ over observed entries are low-rank matrices, and \textit{share a common subspace}. We assume that a large amount $M$ of \textit{unlabeled} data drawn from the sampling distribution $P$ is available, together with a small amount $N$ of labeled data drawn from the same distribution and noisy estimates of the corresponding ground truth entries. This setting is inspired by recommender systems scenarios where the unlabeled data corresponds to `implicit feedback' (consisting in interactions such as purchase, click, etc. ) and the labeled data corresponds to the `explicit feedback', consisting of interactions where the user has given an explicit rating to the item. Leveraging powerful results from the theory of low-rank subspace recovery, together with classic generalization bounds for matrix completion models, we show error bounds consisting of a sum of two error terms scaling as $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{nd}{M}}\right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{dr}{N}}\right)$ respectively, where $d$ is the rank of $P$ and $r$ is the rank of $M$. In synthetic experiments, we confirm that the true generalization error naturally splits into independent error terms corresponding to the estimations of $P$ and and the ground truth matrix $\ground$ respectively. In real-life experiments on Douban and MovieLens with most explicit ratings removed, we demonstrate that the method can outperform baselines relying only on the explicit ratings, demonstrating that our assumptions provide a valid toy theoretical setting to study the interaction between explicit and implicit feedbacks in recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限数据下进行监督微调时，语言模型容易过拟合，依赖虚假模式或损害预训练获得的通用能力

Method: 提出学习自不良方法(LfU)，通过一致性正则化使模型内部表示与不良更新后的表示对齐，利用表示级数据增强

Result: 在数学任务上比普通SFT平均提升16.8%，输出性能标准差降低92.1%，显示更好的鲁棒性

Conclusion: LfU作为有效先验，在有限数据下增强适应性同时保持预训练知识，具有通用效果

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are often adapted through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to specialize their capabilities for downstream tasks. However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to "undesirable" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects.

<details>

Motivation: 核学习方法能显著提高Hopfield网络的存储容量，但其背后的动力学增强机制仍不清楚，需要深入理解网络能量景观的几何特性。

Method: 引入"峰顶锐度"新指标量化吸引子局部稳定性，通过系统改变核宽度和存储负载分析吸引子形状相图，理论分解景观梯度为直接"驱动"力和间接"反馈"力。

Result: 发现了"优化脊"现象，对应两种力强反相关的状态，其中高压存储负载放大的直接力主导了反对的集体反馈力，形成鲁棒能量景观。

Conclusion: 网络自适应地利用模式间相互作用作为协同反馈控制系统来塑造鲁棒能量景观，为高容量联想记忆的稳定性提供了新的物理图像和设计原则。

Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, ``Pinnacle Sharpness,'' to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a ``ridge of optimization,'' where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct ``driving'' force and an indirect ``feedback'' force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个针对延迟反馈和顺序敏感动态的在线决策系统的理论框架，通过Bregman散度作为损失基准，证明了超额基准损失的结构化下界，包含延迟惩罚、顺序敏感性惩罚及其几何交互项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线决策系统经常在延迟反馈和顺序敏感动态下运行，其中动作会影响观察结果的到达顺序。现有方法难以统一处理这些异质性效应，需要一个新的理论框架来量化这些影响。

Method: 使用Bregman散度作为损失基准，推导出超额基准损失的结构化下界，包含延迟惩罚g1、顺序敏感性惩罚g2、几何交互项g12和非凸性惩罚D_ncx。扩展到近正则和弱凸设置，并通过2×2随机化实验和流式诊断进行估计和监控。

Result: 得到了一个包含四个可解释项的结构化下界不等式，能够统一量化延迟、非交换性和实现差距效应。该框架在凸Legendre假设下非凸性惩罚消失，在更一般的设置下仍保持鲁棒性保证。

Conclusion: 该框架将异质性延迟、非交换性和实现差距效应打包成一个单一可解释的下界陈述，可以在实际系统中进行压力测试和调优，为在线决策系统提供了新的理论工具和实用方法。

Abstract: Online decision systems routinely operate under delayed feedback and order-sensitive (noncommutative) dynamics: actions affect which observations arrive, and in what sequence. Taking a Bregman divergence $D_Φ$ as the loss benchmark, we prove that the excess benchmark loss admits a structured lower bound $L \ge L_{\mathrm{ideal}} + g_1(λ) + g_2(\varepsilon_\star) + g_{12}(λ,\varepsilon_\star) - D_{\mathrm{ncx}}$, where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are calibrated penalties for latency and order-sensitivity, $g_{12}$ captures their geometric interaction, and $D_{\mathrm{ncx}}\ge 0$ is a nonconvexity/approximation penalty that vanishes under convex Legendre assumptions. We extend this inequality to prox-regular and weakly convex settings, obtaining robust guarantees beyond the convex case. We also give an operational recipe for estimating and monitoring the four terms via simple $2\times 2$ randomized experiments and streaming diagnostics (effective sample size, clipping rate, interaction heatmaps). The framework packages heterogeneous latency, noncommutativity, and implementation-gap effects into a single interpretable lower-bound statement that can be stress-tested and tuned in real-world systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SpMV方法在LLM剪枝产生的低且非结构化稀疏度(30-90%)下性能不佳，导致非结构化剪枝只能提供有限的内存减少和加速效果。

Method: 提出MACKO-SpMV，一种GPU优化的格式和内核协同设计，减少存储开销同时保持与GPU执行模型的兼容性，无需专用硬件单元或格式特定的预计算。

Result: 在50%稀疏度下，MACKO是首个实现显著1.5倍内存减少和1.2-1.5倍加速的方法；相比其他SpMV基线：比cuSPARSE快2.8-13.0倍，比Sputnik快1.9-2.6倍，比DASP快2.2-2.5倍。在Llama2-7B上应用Wanda剪枝到50%稀疏度，实现1.5倍内存减少和1.5倍推理加速。

Conclusion: MACKO使得50%稀疏度的非结构化剪枝在真实世界LLM工作负载中变得可行和合理。

Abstract: Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) is a fundamental operation in the inference of sparse Large Language Models (LLMs). Because existing SpMV methods perform poorly under the low and unstructured sparsity (30-90%) commonly observed in pruned LLMs, unstructured pruning provided only limited memory reduction and speedup. We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision. Thanks to MACKO, unstructured pruning at 50% sparsity is now justified in real-world LLM workloads.

Conclusion: SAGMM为现实世界图学习提供了鲁棒且自适应的解决方案，能够自动选择最适合的模型组合。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.

Abstract: Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) operate in high-pressure environments, making rapid, life-critical decisions under heavy cognitive and operational loads. We present EMSGlass, a smart-glasses system powered by EMSNet, the first multimodal multitask model for Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and EMSServe, a low-latency multimodal serving framework tailored to EMS scenarios. EMSNet integrates text, vital signs, and scene images to construct a unified real-time understanding of EMS incidents. Trained on real-world multimodal EMS datasets, EMSNet simultaneously supports up to five critical EMS tasks with superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art unimodal baselines. Built on top of PyTorch, EMSServe introduces a modality-aware model splitter and a feature caching mechanism, achieving adaptive and efficient inference across heterogeneous hardware while addressing the challenge of asynchronous modality arrival in the field. By optimizing multimodal inference execution in EMS scenarios, EMSServe achieves 1.9x -- 11.7x speedup over direct PyTorch multimodal inference. A user study evaluation with six professional EMTs demonstrates that EMSGlass enhances real-time situational awareness, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency through intuitive on-glass interaction. In addition, qualitative insights from the user study provide actionable directions for extending EMSGlass toward next-generation AI-enabled EMS systems, bridging multimodal intelligence with real-world emergency response workflows.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial, enabling the establishment of appropriate treatment plans and markedly enhancing patient prognosis. While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的MARL架构在大规模网络系统中具有实现可扩展和可泛化控制的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for large-scale network control, yet existing methods face two major limitations. First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.

Result: 在三个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，GFOES在logit和表示层面都实现了有效遗忘，同时保持强性能。

Conclusion: GFOES为数据受限条件下的隐私保护机器学习提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of specific data from trained models to ensure privacy compliance. However, most existing methods assume full access to the original training dataset, which is often impractical. We address a more realistic yet challenging setting: few-shot zero-glance, where only a small subset of the retained data is available and the forget set is entirely inaccessible. We introduce GFOES, a novel framework comprising a Generative Feedback Network (GFN) and a two-phase fine-tuning procedure. GFN synthesises Optimal Erasure Samples (OES), which induce high loss on target classes, enabling the model to forget class-specific knowledge without access to the original forget data, while preserving performance on retained classes. The two-phase fine-tuning procedure enables aggressive forgetting in the first phase, followed by utility restoration in the second. Experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that GFOES achieves effective forgetting at both logit and representation levels, while maintaining strong performance using only 5% of the original data. Our framework offers a practical and scalable solution for privacy-preserving machine learning under data-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Predicting single-cell perturbation outcomes directly advances gene function analysis and facilitates drug candidate selection, making it a key driver of both basic and translational biomedical research. However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions. Joint training enables accurate perturbation modeling and captures single-cell heterogeneity. Experiments on public genetic and drug perturbation datasets show that our model effectively captures heterogeneous single-cell responses and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于掩码的多任务强化学习方法存在两个主要问题：粗粒度的二元掩码过度抑制关键冲突参数，阻碍任务间知识共享；不同任务冲突程度不同，但现有方法使用固定稀疏度策略，限制了模型的泛化能力和学习效率。

Conclusion: SoCo-DT通过软冲突解决和动态稀疏度调整，有效解决了多任务强化学习中的梯度冲突问题，显著提升了模型性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) seeks to learn a unified policy for diverse tasks, but often suffers from gradient conflicts across tasks. Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency.
  To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance.

Conclusion: pFed1BS框架成功实现了通信压缩与个性化学习的平衡，为联邦学习的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training across decentralized data, but faces key challenges of bidirectional communication overhead and client-side data heterogeneity. To address communication costs while embracing data heterogeneity, we propose pFed1BS, a novel personalized federated learning framework that achieves extreme communication compression through one-bit random sketching. In personalized FL, the goal shifts from training a single global model to creating tailored models for each client. In our framework, clients transmit highly compressed one-bit sketches, and the server aggregates and broadcasts a global one-bit consensus. To enable effective personalization, we introduce a sign-based regularizer that guides local models to align with the global consensus while preserving local data characteristics. To mitigate the computational burden of random sketching, we employ the Fast Hadamard Transform for efficient projection. Theoretical analysis guarantees that our algorithm converges to a stationary neighborhood of the global potential function. Numerical simulations demonstrate that pFed1BS substantially reduces communication costs while achieving competitive performance compared to advanced communication-efficient FL algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning techniques not only improve the adaptability to diverse downstream tasks, but also mitigate adverse effects of model quantization. Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions.

Abstract: Quadratic programming (QP) solvers are widely used in real-time control and optimization, but their computational cost often limits applicability in time-critical settings. We propose a learning-to-optimize approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict active sets in the dual active-set solver DAQP. The method exploits the structural properties of QPs by representing them as bipartite graphs and learning to identify the optimal active set for efficiently warm-starting the solver. Across varying problem sizes, the GNN consistently reduces the number of solver iterations compared to cold-starting, while performance is comparable to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline. Furthermore, a GNN trained on varying problem sizes generalizes effectively to unseen dimensions, demonstrating flexibility and scalability. These results highlight the potential of structure-aware learning to accelerate optimization in real-time applications such as model predictive control.

Abstract: With the development of digital twins and smart manufacturing systems, there is an urgent need for real-time distortion field prediction to control defects in metal Additive Manufacturing (AM). However, numerical simulation methods suffer from high computational cost, long run-times that prevent real-time use, while conventional Machine learning (ML) models struggle to extract spatiotemporal features for long-horizon prediction and fail to decouple thermo-mechanical fields. This paper proposes a Physics-informed Neural Operator (PINO) to predict z and y-direction distortion for the future 15 s. Our method, Physics-informed Deep Operator Network-Recurrent Neural Network (PIDeepONet-RNN) employs trunk and branch network to process temperature history and encode distortion fields, respectively, enabling decoupling of thermo-mechanical responses. By incorporating the heat conduction equation as a soft constraint, the model ensures physical consistency and suppresses unphysical artifacts, thereby establishing a more physically consistent mapping between the thermal history and distortion. This is important because such a basis function, grounded in physical laws, provides a robust and interpretable foundation for predictions. The proposed models are trained and tested using datasets generated from experimentally validated Finite Element Method (FEM). Evaluation shows that the model achieves high accuracy, low error accumulation, time efficiency. The max absolute errors in the z and y-directions are as low as 0.9733 mm and 0.2049 mm, respectively. The error distribution shows high errors in the molten pool but low gradient norms in the deposited and key areas. The performance of PINO surrogate model highlights its potential for real-time long-horizon physics field prediction in controlling defects.

Abstract: Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy is a powerful and rapid technique widely used in medicine, material science, and chemical analyses. However, its effectiveness is hindered by the presence of a non-resonant background that interferes with and distorts the true Raman signal. Deep learning methods have been employed to reconstruct the true Raman spectrum from measured CARS data using labeled datasets. A more recent development integrates the domain knowledge of Kramers-Kronig relationships and smoothness constraints in the form of physics-informed loss functions. However, these deterministic models lack the ability to quantify uncertainty, an essential feature for reliable deployment in high-stakes scientific and biomedical applications. In this work, we evaluate and compare various uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques within the context of CARS-to-Raman signal reconstruction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating physics-informed constraints into these models improves their calibration, offering a promising path toward more trustworthy CARS data analysis.

Abstract: Self-play reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in learning complex strategic and interactive behaviors in competitive multi-agent games. However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments. These challenges often cause methods to converge slowly or fail to converge at all to a Nash equilibrium, making agents vulnerable to strategic exploitation by unseen opponents. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $ε$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games. Simulation results show that the learned policies are robust against diverse opponents and outperform baseline reinforcement learning policies. Our approach achieves up to 3$\times$ faster convergence and 30$\times$ higher success rates on average against RL-based baselines, demonstrating its robustness to opponent strategies and stability across training iterations

Result: 在序列长度达624K的数据集上测试，ParaDySe成功解决了LLM训练中的内存不足和通信并行化取消瓶颈。

Conclusion: ParaDySe通过系统集成长序列优化与现有框架，实现了最优策略的无缝热切换，有效提升了LLM训练效率。

Abstract: Dynamic sequences with varying lengths have been widely used in the training of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). However, current training frameworks adopt a pre-defined static parallel strategy for these sequences, causing neither communication-parallelization cancellation on short sequences nor out-of-memory on long sequences. To mitigate these issues, we propose ParaDySe, a novel adaptive Parallel strategy switching framework for Dynamic Sequences. ParaDySe enables on-the-fly optimal strategy adoption according to the immediate input sequence. It first implements the modular function libraries for parallel strategies with unified tensor layout specifications, and then builds sequence-aware memory and time cost models with hybrid methods. Guided by cost models, ParaDySe selects optimal layer-wise strategies for dynamic sequences via an efficient heuristic algorithm. By integrating these techniques together, ParaDySe achieves seamless hot-switching of optimal strategies through its well-designed function libraries. We compare ParaDySe with baselines on representative LLMs under datasets with sequence lengths up to 624K. Experimental results indicate that ParaDySe addresses OOM and CPC bottlenecks in LLM training by systematically integrating long-sequence optimizations with existing frameworks.

TL;DR: TokenSqueeze是一种新的Long2Short方法，通过自适应选择推理深度和分布对齐的语言精炼，在保持准确性的同时显著减少推理LLMs的token使用量，实现50%的平均token减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理LLMs生成的长链式思维轨迹导致token使用量增加，带来更高的推理延迟和内存消耗。现有Long2Short方法在减少推理长度的同时往往牺牲准确性，需要一种在降低token成本的同时保持性能的方法。

Method: 1. 自适应选择推理深度：根据问题复杂度匹配推理深度，防止过度压缩导致性能下降；2. 分布对齐的语言精炼：在不改变底层推理路径的情况下优化语言表达，提高推理路径的清晰度和简洁性。

Result: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B使用该方法在MATH500基准测试中实现了50%的平均token减少，同时保持准确性。该方法仅使用模型自生成数据，无需依赖人工整理的短答案数据集。

Conclusion: TokenSqueeze有效解决了推理LLMs的效率-准确性权衡问题，能够在保持性能的同时显著降低token使用量，适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Emerging reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces. However, these long CoTs result in increased token usage, leading to higher inference latency and memory consumption. As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark. TokenSqueeze exclusively utilizes the model's self-generated data, enabling efficient and high-fidelity reasoning without relying on manually curated short-answer datasets across diverse applications.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis posits that high-dimensional data typically resides on low-dimensional sub spaces. In this paper, we assume manifold hypothesis to investigate graph-based semi-supervised learning

  an infinite-dimensional setting. To achieve this, we prove variational convergence of a discrete graph p- Dirichlet energy to its continuum counterpart. In addition, we characterize the Laplace-Beltrami operator
  on asubmanifold of the Wasserstein space. Finally, we validate the proposed theoretical framework through
  numerical experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the consistency of our classification performance in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Traditional gradient boosting algorithms employ static tree structures with fixed splitting criteria that remain unchanged throughout training, limiting their ability to adapt to evolving gradient distributions and problem-specific characteristics across different learning stages. This work introduces MorphBoost, a new gradient boosting framework featuring self-organizing tree structures that dynamically morph their splitting behavior during training. The algorithm implements adaptive split functions that evolve based on accumulated gradient statistics and iteration-dependent learning pressures, enabling automatic adjustment to problem complexity. Key innovations include: (1) morphing split criterion combining gradient-based scores with information-theoretic metrics weighted by training progress; (2) automatic problem fingerprinting for intelligent parameter configuration across binary/multiclass/regression tasks; (3) vectorized tree prediction achieving significant computational speedups; (4) interaction-aware feature importance detecting multiplicative relationships; and (5) fast-mode optimization balancing speed and accuracy. Comprehensive benchmarking across 10 diverse datasets against competitive models (XGBoost, LightGBM, GradientBoosting, HistGradientBoosting, ensemble methods) demonstrates that MorphBoost achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming XGBoost by 0.84% on average. MorphBoost secured the overall winner position with 4/10 dataset wins (40% win rate) and 6/30 top-3 finishes (20%), while maintaining the lowest variance (σ=0.0948) and highest minimum accuracy across all models, revealing superior consistency and robustness. Performance analysis across difficulty levels shows competitive results on easy datasets while achieving notable improvements on advanced problems due to higher adaptation levels.

Conclusion: CONFETTI通过最小化改变提供可操作的见解，提高了可解释性和决策支持能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have improved multivariate time series (MTS) classification and regression by capturing complex patterns, but their lack of transparency hinders decision-making. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer partial insights, yet often fall short of conveying the full decision space. Counterfactual Explanations (CE) provide a promising alternative, but current approaches typically prioritize either accuracy, proximity or sparsity -- rarely all -- limiting their practical value. To address this, we propose CONFETTI, a novel multi-objective CE method for MTS. CONFETTI identifies key MTS subsequences, locates a counterfactual target, and optimally modifies the time series to balance prediction confidence, proximity and sparsity. This method provides actionable insights with minimal changes, improving interpretability, and decision support. CONFETTI is evaluated on seven MTS datasets from the UEA archive, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains. CONFETTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CE methods in its optimization objectives, and in six other metrics from the literature, achieving $\geq10\%$ higher confidence while improving sparsity in $\geq40\%$.

Abstract: Real-world tasks and environments exhibit differences from the static datasets that large language models (LLMs) are typically evaluated on. Such tasks can involve sequential interaction, requiring coherent updating of beliefs in light of new evidence, and making appropriate decisions based on those beliefs. Predicting how LLMs will perform in such dynamic environments is important, but can be tricky to determine from measurements in static settings. In this work, we examine two critical components of LLM performance: the ability of LLMs to coherently update their beliefs, and the extent to which the actions they take are consistent with those beliefs. First, we find that LLMs are largely inconsistent in how they update their beliefs; models can exhibit up to a 30% average difference between the directly elicited posterior, and the correct update of their prior. Second, we find that LLMs also often take actions which are inconsistent with the beliefs they hold. On a betting market, for example, LLMs often do not even bet in the same direction as their internally held beliefs over the underlying outcomes. We also find they have moderate self-inconsistency in how they respond to challenges by users to given answers. Finally, we show that the above properties hold even for strong models that obtain high accuracy or that are well-calibrated on the tasks at hand. Our results highlight the difficulties of predicting LLM behavior in complex real-world settings.

Abstract: Multimodal Model Editing (MMED) aims to correct erroneous knowledge in multimodal models. Existing evaluation methods, adapted from textual model editing, overstate success by relying on low-similarity or random inputs, obscure overfitting. We propose a comprehensive locality evaluation framework, covering three key dimensions: random-image locality, no-image locality, and consistent-image locality, operationalized through seven distinct data types, enabling a detailed and structured analysis of multimodal edits. We introduce De-VQA, a dynamic evaluation for visual question answering, uncovering a phenomenon we term transient blindness, overfitting to edit-similar text while ignoring visuals. Token analysis shows edits disproportionately affect textual tokens. We propose locality-aware adversarial losses to balance cross-modal representations. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing transient blindness and improving locality by 17% on average.

Abstract: Accurate protein structures are essential for understanding biological function, yet incorporating experimental data into protein generative models remains a major challenge. Most predictors of experimental observables are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with gradient-based conditional sampling. This is especially limiting in nuclear magnetic resonance, where rich data such as chemical shifts are hard to directly integrate into generative modeling. We introduce a framework for non-differentiable guidance of protein generative models, coupling a continuous diffusion-based generator with any black-box objective via a tailored genetic algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness across three modalities: pairwise distance constraints, nuclear Overhauser effect restraints, and for the first time chemical shifts. These results establish chemical shift guided structure generation as feasible, expose key weaknesses in current predictors, and showcase a general strategy for incorporating diverse experimental signals. Our work points toward automated, data-conditioned protein modeling beyond the limits of differentiability.

Motivation: 为ogbn-proteins数据集建立可复现、边缘感知的基准方法，研究实践中主导的两个系统选择：边缘证据如何聚合为节点输入，以及如何在消息传递中使用边缘。

Method: 使用PyTorch Geometric实现GraphSAGE，比较不同的边缘特征聚合方法（sum、mean、max）和归一化技术（LayerNorm、BatchNorm、Conditional LayerNorm），并应用后处理技术如温度缩放和标签相关平滑。

Result: 在主要实验设置中，sum聚合始终优于mean和max；BatchNorm获得最佳AUC，Conditional LayerNorm在AUC前沿匹配的同时具有更好的阈值F1；后处理技术显著提升micro-F1和校准误差，对AUC影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 建立了ogbn-proteins的标准化基线，确定了最佳实践方法组合，并展示了后处理技术对模型决策质量的显著提升，为后续研究提供了可靠基准。

Abstract: We present reproducible, edge-aware baselines for ogbn-proteins in PyTorch Geometric (PyG). We study two system choices that dominate practice: (i) how 8-dimensional edge evidence is aggregated into node inputs, and (ii) how edges are used inside message passing. Our strongest baseline is GraphSAGE with sum-based edge-to-node features. We compare LayerNorm (LN), BatchNorm (BN), and a species-aware Conditional LayerNorm (CLN), and report compute cost (time, VRAM, parameters) together with accuracy (ROC-AUC) and decision quality. In our primary experimental setup (hidden size 512, 3 layers, 3 seeds), sum consistently beats mean and max; BN attains the best AUC, while CLN matches the AUC frontier with better thresholded F1. Finally, post-hoc per-label temperature scaling plus per-label thresholds substantially improves micro-F1 and expected calibration error (ECE) with negligible AUC change, and light label-correlation smoothing yields small additional gains.

Abstract: GPU kernels are critical for ML performance but difficult to optimize across diverse accelerators. We present KForge, a platform-agnostic framework built on two collaborative LLM-based agents: a generation agent that produces and iteratively refines programs through compilation and correctness feedback, and a performance analysis agent that interprets profiling data to guide optimization. This agent-based architecture requires only a single-shot example to target new platforms.
  We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.

Conclusion: 基于Voronoi分区的局部专业化线性模型蒸馏方法能够有效平衡模型复杂性和性能，提供可解释的控制器同时保持或提升原始性能。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning is one of the state-of-the-art methods for producing near-optimal system controllers. However, deep RL algorithms train a deep neural network, that lacks transparency, which poses challenges when the controller has to meet regulations, or foster trust. To alleviate this, one could transfer the learned behaviour into a model that is human-readable by design using knowledge distilla- tion. Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller. We evaluate our approach on a gridworld environment and a classic control task. We observe that our proposed distillation to locally- specialized linear models produces policies that are explainable and show that the distillation matches or even slightly outperforms the black-box policy they are distilled from.

Conclusion: 位置编码在表格Transformer中具有意想不到的作用，能够通过降低问题维度来改善泛化性能。

Abstract: Supervised learning with tabular data presents unique challenges, including low data sizes, the absence of structural cues, and heterogeneous features spanning both categorical and continuous domains. Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了岩体结构的定量表征，支持更安全、更可靠的数据驱动岩土工程设计。

Abstract: Rock discontinuities critically govern the mechanical behavior and stability of rock masses. Their internal distributions remain largely unobservable and are typically inferred from surface-exposed discontinuities using generative prediction approaches. However, surface-exposed observations are inherently sparse, and existing generative prediction approaches either fail to capture the underlying complex distribution patterns or lack robustness under data-sparse conditions. Here, we proposed a simple yet robust approach for statistically accurate generative prediction of rock discontinuities by utilizing a tabular foundation model. By leveraging the powerful sample learning capability of the foundation model specifically designed for small data, our approach can effectively capture the underlying complex distribution patterns within limited measured discontinuities. Comparative experiments on ten datasets with diverse scales and distribution patterns of discontinuities demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness over conventional statistical models and deep generative approaches. This work advances quantitative characterization of rock mass structures, supporting safer and more reliable data-driven geotechnical design.

Abstract: Food analysis has become increasingly critical for health-related tasks such as personalized nutrition and chronic disease prevention. However, existing large multimodal models (LMMs) in food analysis suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks, requiring costly retraining from scratch. To address this, we propose a novel continual learning framework for multimodal food learning, integrating a Dual-LoRA architecture with Quality-Enhanced Pseudo Replay. We introduce two complementary low-rank adapters for each task: a specialized LoRA that learns task-specific knowledge with orthogonal constraints to previous tasks' subspaces, and a cooperative LoRA that consolidates shared knowledge across tasks via pseudo replay. To improve the reliability of replay data, our Quality-Enhanced Pseudo Replay strategy leverages self-consistency and semantic similarity to reduce hallucinations in generated samples. Experiments on the comprehensive Uni-Food dataset show superior performance in mitigating forgetting, representing the first effective continual learning approach for complex food tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in distributed healthcare, including consolidating specialized domain knowledge across institutions while maintaining privacy, reducing computational overhead, and preventing catastrophic forgetting during model updates.This paper presents a systematic evaluation of six parameter-space merging techniques applied to two architecturally compatible medical LLMs derived from the Mistral-7B base model. We introduce a novel hierarchical method that combines selective Optimal Transport (OT) alignment for attention layers with cosine similarity-weighted interpolation, designed to address permutation variance while minimizing computational overhead for edge deployment scenarios. Our study evaluates Task Arithmetic, Linear Averaging, DARE-TIES, DELLA, Breadcrumbs, and our Hierarchical approach across five medical benchmarks. Results demonstrate that architecturally compatible models benefit significantly from simple averaging methods, with Task Arithmetic achieving 45.80% accuracy on MedQA, outperforming complex pruning-based approaches. These findings offer critical insights for the deployment of distributed medical AI in resource-constrained IoT environments, where computational efficiency and model compatibility are paramount. Our work establishes that for architecturally compatible models, simple averaging provides a robust and computationally efficient baseline for knowledge consolidation, offering a pragmatic path forward for scalable medical AI systems.

Abstract: Since Isaac Newton first studied the Kissing Number Problem in 1694, determining the maximal number of non-overlapping spheres around a central sphere has remained a fundamental challenge. This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry problems.

Abstract: Bayesian parameter inference for complex stochastic simulators is challenging due to intractable likelihood functions. Existing simulation-based inference methods often require large number of simulations and become costly to use in high-dimensional parameter spaces or in problems with partially uninformative outputs. We propose a new method for differentiable simulators that delivers accurate posterior inference with substantially reduced runtimes. Building on the Optimization Monte Carlo framework, our approach reformulates stochastic simulation as deterministic optimization problems. Gradient-based methods are then applied to efficiently navigate toward high-density posterior regions and avoid wasteful simulations in low-probability areas. A JAX-based implementation further enhances the performance through vectorization of key method components. Extensive experiments, including high-dimensional parameter spaces, uninformative outputs, multiple observations and multimodal posteriors show that our method consistently matches, and often exceeds, the accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches, while reducing the runtime by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.

Abstract: Accurate short-range prediction of extreme air temperature events remains a fundamental challenge in operational climate-risk management. We present Multi-Modal Weather State Transition Model with Anomaly-Driven Recurrent Attention Network Plus (MMWSTM-ADRAN+), a dual-stream deep learning architecture that couples a regime-aware dynamics model with an anomaly-focused attention mechanism to forecast daily maximum temperature and its extremes. The first stream, MMWSTM, combines bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) units with a learnable Markov state transition matrix to capture synoptic-scale weather regime changes. The second stream, ADRAN, integrates bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs), multi-head self-attention, and a novel anomaly amplification layer to enhance sensitivity to low-probability signals. A lightweight attentive fusion gate adaptively determines the contribution of each stream to the final prediction. Model optimization employs a custom ExtremeWeatherLoss function that up-weights errors on the upper 5% and lower 5% of the temperature distribution, and a time-series data augmentation suite (jittering, scaling, time/magnitude warping) that effectively quadruples the training data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的数据缩放定律主要研究单轮训练海量数据的情况，但在有限数据和多轮训练下的缩放规律尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别关注多轮训练如何改变数据缩放定律。

Method: 在线性回归框架下，通过理论分析研究SGD在强凸性或Zipf分布数据下的缩放行为，定义了有效重用率E(K,N)作为核心指标，并进行实证验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：小K时E(K,N)≈K，每轮训练带来线性增益；大K时E(K,N)达到与N相关的平台值（强凸情况下为Θ(logN)），说明大数据集可以重复更多轮次。实证结果支持理论发现。

Conclusion: 数据重用效果不仅取决于训练轮数K，还依赖于数据规模N和分布特性，这指出了在数据缩放定律研究中需要同时建模这两个因素的重要性。

Abstract: While data scaling laws of large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined in the one-pass regime with massive corpora, their form under limited data and repeated epochs remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of how a common workaround, training for multiple epochs on the same dataset, reshapes the data scaling laws in linear regression. Concretely, we ask: to match the performance of training on a dataset of size $N$ for $K$ epochs, how much larger must a dataset be if the model is trained for only one pass? We quantify this using the \textit{effective reuse rate} of the data, $E(K, N)$, which we define as the multiplicative factor by which the dataset must grow under one-pass training to achieve the same test loss as $K$-epoch training. Our analysis precisely characterizes the scaling behavior of $E(K, N)$ for SGD in linear regression under either strong convexity or Zipf-distributed data: (1) When $K$ is small, we prove that $E(K, N) \approx K$, indicating that every new epoch yields a linear gain; (2) As $K$ increases, $E(K, N)$ plateaus at a problem-dependent value that grows with $N$ ($Θ(\log N)$ for the strongly-convex case), implying that larger datasets can be repeated more times before the marginal benefit vanishes. These theoretical findings point out a neglected factor in a recent empirical study (Muennighoff et al. (2023)), which claimed that training LLMs for up to $4$ epochs results in negligible loss differences compared to using fresh data at each step, \textit{i.e.}, $E(K, N) \approx K$ for $K \le 4$ in our notation. Supported by further empirical validation with LLMs, our results reveal that the maximum $K$ value for which $E(K, N) \approx K$ in fact depends on the data size and distribution, and underscore the need to explicitly model both factors in future studies of scaling laws with data reuse.

Abstract: Industrial process monitoring increasingly relies on sensor-generated time-series data, yet the lack of labels, high variability, and operational noise make it difficult to extract meaningful patterns using conventional methods. Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems.

Abstract: Right heart failure (RHF) is a disease characterized by abnormalities in the structure or function of the right ventricle (RV), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice.

Abstract: In the area of explainable artificial intelligence, Symbolic Regression (SR) has emerged as a promising approach by discovering interpretable mathematical expressions that fit data. However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture. Experimental results demonstrate competitive predictive performance alongside high interpretability, effectively extending symbolic regression to broader real-world multi-output tasks.

Abstract: Since the 21st century, artificial intelligence has been leading a new round of industrial revolution. Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima. Entering the era of large language models, although the scale of model parameters and data has increased, Adam remains the mainstream optimization algorithm. However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance.

Result: 在美国东部六个生态多样流域的河流温度预测实验中，GREAT在零样本场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GREAT为环境应用提供了实用解决方案，在全面监测不可行的情况下改善模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Environmental modeling faces critical challenges in predicting ecosystem dynamics across unmonitored regions due to limited and geographically imbalanced observation data. This challenge is compounded by spatial heterogeneity, causing models to learn spurious patterns that fit only local data. Unlike conventional domain generalization, environmental modeling must preserve invariant physical relationships and temporal coherence during augmentation. In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments. Experimental results show that GREAT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot scenarios. This work provides a practical solution for environmental applications where comprehensive monitoring is infeasible.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has attracted growing interest with the rapid parallel advances in large-scale classical machine learning and quantum technologies. Similar to classical machine learning, QML models also face challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled data, particularly as their scale and complexity increase. Here, we introduce self-supervised pretraining of quantum representations that reduces reliance on labeled data by learning invariances from unlabeled examples. We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples. Unlike prior work, our pipeline derives similarity from measured quantum overlaps and executes all training and classification stages on hardware. These results establish a label-efficient route to quantum representation learning, with direct relevance to quantum-native datasets and a clear path to larger classical inputs.

Abstract: This paper presents Naga, a deep State Space Model (SSM) encoding approach inspired by structural concepts from Vedic mathematics. The proposed method introduces a bidirectional representation for time series by jointly processing forward and time-reversed input sequences. These representations are then combined through an element-wise (Hadamard) interaction, resulting in a Vedic-inspired encoding that enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies across distant time steps. We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI. The experimental results show that Naga outperforms 28 current state of the art models and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing deep SSM-based approaches. The findings suggest that incorporating structured, Vedic-inspired decomposition can provide an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for long-range sequence modeling.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is a critical challenge in machine learning. While neural networks are highly versatile and capable of learning complex patterns, they often lack interpretability due to their ``black box'' nature. On the other hand, probabilistic ``white box'' models, though interpretable, often suffer from a significant performance gap when compared to neural networks. To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability. By mapping the kernel mean embedding (KME) of a time series data vector to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we construct a tensor network-inspired 1D spin chain Hamiltonian, with the KME as one of its eigen-functions or eigen-modes. We then solve the associated Schr{ö}dinger equation and apply perturbation theory to quantify uncertainty, thereby improving the interpretability of tasks performed with the quantum tensor network-based model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, compared to state-of-the-art ``white box" models, in change point detection and time series clustering, providing insights into the uncertainties associated with decision-making throughout the process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于patch的分类方法虽然能降低标注成本、简化训练，但会引入patch组成与标签之间的伪相关性（肿瘤patch通常包含更大组织区域，而非肿瘤patch多为背景）。

Method: 采用GERNE去偏方法，该方法可适配以最大化最差组准确率(WGA)，用于缓解patch组成与标签之间的伪相关性问题。

Result: 相比ERM方法，在两个不同阈值下二值化伪特征时，WGA提升了约7%，在关键少数情况（小组织的肿瘤patch和大组织的非肿瘤patch）上表现更好。

Conclusion: 在基于patch的分类问题中，考虑伪相关性的学习至关重要，去偏策略能有效提升模型在关键少数情况下的性能。

Abstract: Patch-wise multi-label classification provides an efficient alternative to full pixel-wise segmentation on high-resolution images, particularly when the objective is to determine the presence or absence of target objects within a patch rather than their precise spatial extent. This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in Graph Neural Networks is fundamental to promoting trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility.

Motivation: 现有图OOD检测方法通常只捕捉内分布特征计算OOD分数，限制了预训练模型表示分布边界的能力，且图数据的潜在结构由多个因素控制的问题未被充分探索。

Method: BaCa方法通过估计图核并应用混合策略生成边界感知的判别性拓扑，构建双动态字典捕获潜在ID和OOD表示，用于边界感知的OOD分数校准。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，BaCa在OOD检测方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: BaCa是一种有效的测试时图OOD检测方法，通过动态字典和边界感知校准提高了检测性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in graph out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies in the absence of ground-truth OOD samples during training. Existing methods are typically optimized to capture features within the in-distribution (ID) data and calculate OOD scores, which often limits pre-trained models from representing distributional boundaries, leading to unreliable OOD detection. Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration. To the best of our knowledge, extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that BaCa significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in OOD detection.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC), which aims to separate the multi-view data into distinct clusters in an unsupervised manner, is a fundamental yet challenging task. To enhance its applicability in real-world scenarios, this paper addresses a more challenging task: MVC under multi-source noises, including missing noise and observation noise. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Reliability-Aware Contrastive Deep Multi-View Clustering (RAC-DMVC), which constructs a reliability graph to guide robust representation learning under noisy environments. Specifically, to address observation noise, we introduce a cross-view reconstruction to enhances robustness at the data level, and a reliability-aware noise contrastive learning to mitigates bias in positive and negative pairs selection caused by noisy representations. To handle missing noise, we design a dual-attention imputation to capture shared information across views while preserving view-specific features. In addition, a self-supervised cluster distillation module further refines the learned representations and improves the clustering performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that RAC-DMVC outperforms SOTA methods on multiple evaluation metrics and maintains excellent performance under varying ratios of noise.

Conclusion: 通过解耦拟牛顿更新并保持采集函数调用的批量化，可以有效解决贝叶斯优化中采集函数优化的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) efficiently finds high-performing parameters by maximizing an acquisition function, which models the promise of parameters. A major computational bottleneck arises in acquisition function optimization, where multi-start optimization (MSO) with quasi-Newton (QN) methods is required due to the non-convexity of the acquisition function. BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence. To address this problem, we propose to decouple QN updates using a coroutine while batching the acquisition function calls. Our approach not only yields the theoretically identical convergence to the sequential MSO but also drastically reduces the wall-clock time compared to the previous approaches.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) is fueled by the growing reliance on datasets that blend real and synthetic data. While synthetic data offers scalability and cost-efficiency, it often introduces systematic distributional discrepancies, particularly underrepresenting long-tail knowledge due to truncation effects from data generation mechanisms like top-p sampling, temperature scaling, and finite sampling. These discrepancies pose fundamental challenges in characterizing and evaluating the utility of mixed real-synthetic datasets. In this paper, we identify a three-phase scaling behavior characterized by two breakpoints that reflect transitions in model behavior across learning head and tail knowledge. We further derive an LLM generalization bound designed for real and synthetic mixtures, revealing several key factors that govern their generalization performance. Building on our theoretical findings, we propose an effective yet efficient data valuation method that scales to large-scale datasets. Comprehensive experiments across four tasks, including image classification, sentiment classification, instruction following, and complex reasoning, demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in data valuation with significantly low computational cost.

Abstract: Finding human-understandable circuits in language models is a central goal of the field of mechanistic interpretability. We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part responsible for the task. These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models. Our work produces circuits that achieve an unprecedented level of human understandability and validates them with considerable rigor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析了优化超参数（如学习率、权重衰减、动量和批大小）对迁移攻击和查询攻击鲁棒性的影响，发现学习率对两类攻击存在相反影响，并提出分布式训练模型通过超参数调优能最有效地同时抵御两类攻击。

Motivation: 研究优化超参数如何影响对抗攻击鲁棒性，填补了现有研究在超参数对迁移攻击和查询攻击影响机制方面的空白，旨在为实际部署场景提供鲁棒性增强策略。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，在集中训练、集成学习和分布式训练等多种实际部署设置下，系统研究学习率、权重衰减、动量和批大小等超参数对两类攻击鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 发现学习率对两类攻击存在显著二分现象：降低学习率可使迁移攻击鲁棒性提升高达64%，而提高学习率可使查询攻击鲁棒性提升高达28%。分布式模型通过超参数调优能最有效地同时缓解两类攻击。

Conclusion: 优化超参数是增强模型对抗攻击鲁棒性的有效手段，特别是分布式训练模型通过精心设计的超参数调优，能够实现对抗迁移攻击和查询攻击的最佳权衡。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first detailed analysis of how optimization hyperparameters -- such as learning rate, weight decay, momentum, and batch size -- influence robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups.

Abstract: Modern scientific simulations, observations, and large-scale experiments generate data at volumes that often exceed the limits of storage, processing, and analysis. This challenge drives the development of data reduction methods that efficiently manage massive datasets while preserving essential physical features and quantities of interest. In many scientific workflows, it is also crucial to enable data recovery from compressed representations - a task known as super-resolution - with guarantees on the preservation of key physical characteristics. A notable example is checkpointing and restarting, which is essential for long-running simulations to recover from failures, resume after interruptions, or examine intermediate results. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for scientific data compression and super-resolution, grounded in recent advances in learning exponential families. Our method preserves and quantifies uncertainty in physical quantities of interest and supports flexible trade-offs between compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: A learning task, understood as the problem of fitting a parametric model from supervised data, fundamentally requires the dataset to be large enough to be representative of the underlying distribution of the source. When data is limited, the learned models fail generalize to cases not seen during training. This paper introduces a multi-task \emph{cross-learning} framework to overcome data scarcity by jointly estimating \emph{deterministic} parameters across multiple, related tasks. We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical. We provide theoretical guarantees in a controlled framework with Gaussian data, and show the efficiency of our cross-learning method in applications with real data including image classification and propagation of infectious diseases.

Abstract: In this study, we tackle the challenging task of predicting secondary structures from protein primary sequences, a pivotal initial stride towards predicting tertiary structures, while yielding crucial insights into protein activity, relationships, and functions. Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model, SSRGNet surpasses the baseline on f1-scores.

Conclusion: CDL_K为决策制定中的校准理论引入了新的定义和算法技术，在保持理论严谨性的同时解决了计算可行性问题。

Abstract: A decision-theoretic characterization of perfect calibration is that an agent seeking to minimize a proper loss in expectation cannot improve their outcome by post-processing a perfectly calibrated predictor. Hu and Wu (FOCS'24) use this to define an approximate calibration measure called calibration decision loss ($\mathsf{CDL}$), which measures the maximal improvement achievable by any post-processing over any proper loss. Unfortunately, $\mathsf{CDL}$ turns out to be intractable to even weakly approximate in the offline setting, given black-box access to the predictions and labels.
  We suggest circumventing this by restricting attention to structured families of post-processing functions $K$. We define the calibration decision loss relative to $K$, denoted $\mathsf{CDL}_K$ where we consider all proper losses but restrict post-processings to a structured family $K$. We develop a comprehensive theory of when $\mathsf{CDL}_K$ is information-theoretically and computationally tractable, and use it to prove both upper and lower bounds for natural classes $K$. In addition to introducing new definitions and algorithmic techniques to the theory of calibration for decision making, our results give rigorous guarantees for some widely used recalibration procedures in machine learning.

Motivation: 非线性相互作用和随机效应的不完全知识使得自下而上的建模方法效果不佳，特别是在基因调控网络和信号通路等复杂系统中，考虑随机效应对于理解动态行为至关重要。

Method: Trine采用三阶段算法，结合可解析求解的子问题和结构化核架构，能够捕捉突发的噪声驱动波动和平滑的状态依赖方差变化。

Result: 在生物和生态系统上的验证表明，Trine能够在不依赖预定义参数假设的情况下揭示隐藏动态，在多个基准问题上达到与oracle相当的性能。

Conclusion: Trine框架为理解内在噪声如何影响复杂系统行为开辟了新途径，其oracle可被视为能够直接追踪细胞内分子浓度或反应事件随机波动的理想化观察者。

Abstract: Understanding the principles that govern dynamical systems is a central challenge across many scientific domains, including biology and ecology. Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems.

Method: 提出ST-ProC框架，结合图原型核心和基础SSL支持。核心部分通过图正则化、原型锚定和边缘感知伪标签策略利用数据流形并主动拒绝噪声；支持部分通过对比学习和师生一致性损失确保高质量表示和鲁棒优化。

Conclusion: ST-ProC通过有效利用数据流形结构和多目标优化策略，成功解决了出行模式识别中的标签稀缺问题，为半监督学习在轨迹数据分析中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Travel mode identification (TMI) from GPS trajectories is critical for urban intelligence, but is hampered by the high cost of annotation, leading to severe label scarcity. Prevailing semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are ill-suited for this task, as they suffer from catastrophic confirmation bias and ignore the intrinsic data manifold. We propose ST-ProC, a novel graph-prototypical multi-objective SSL framework to address these limitations. Our framework synergizes a graph-prototypical core with foundational SSL Support. The core exploits the data manifold via graph regularization, prototypical anchoring, and a novel, margin-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to actively reject noise. This core is supported and stabilized by foundational contrastive and teacher-student consistency losses, ensuring high-quality representations and robust optimization. ST-ProC outperforms all baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world sparse-label settings, with a performance boost of 21.5% over state-of-the-art methods like FixMatch.

Result: 泛癌分析显示聚类几乎完美对齐组织来源；在KIRC中发现k=5的聚类方案，包含一个罕见亚型C0（6.85%患者），具有高度稳定性（Jaccard=0.787）。

Conclusion: 泛癌聚类受组织来源主导，而基于稳定性的癌症内分析方法能够发现罕见且可复现的KIRC亚型。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning on high-dimensional RNA-seq data can reveal molecular subtypes beyond standard labels. We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI "Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype.

Abstract: As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of extreme events such as wildfires, the need for accurate, explainable, and actionable forecasting becomes increasingly urgent. While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, accessible, and trustworthy, essential for effective use in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and climate resilience planning.

Abstract: The growing use of triaxial particles in microfluidic, microrobotic, and biological systems makes it essential to understand how their rotational dynamics couples with lateral migration in microscale flows. Our experiments in inertial Poiseuille flow reveal that geometric asymmetry in triaxial, multifaceted disks governs their orientation, migration, and rotational period, distinguishing them from classical axisymmetric objects. We identified a Reynolds- and geometry-dependent shift in preferred rotational orientation, arising from the Dzhanibekov effect, with transition modes determined by the particle's principal-axis configuration. We quantified a scalar offset from Jeffery's orbit prediction and introduced a fitting parameter that generalizes the Jeffery equation to include moment-of-inertia effects on rotational dynamics. Finally, we report the diameter of gyration as a predictor of the lateral equilibrium position of inertially focused triaxial particles. Our results link particle asymmetry to migration and rotation in flow, expanding our understanding of particle dynamics.

Abstract: Systematic deflection of microparticles off of initial streamlines is a fundamental task in microfluidics, aiming at applications including sorting, accumulation, or capture of the transported particles. In a large class of setups, including Deterministic Lateral Displacement and porous media filtering, particles in non-inertial (Stokes) flows are deflected by an array of obstacles. We show that net deflection of force-free particles passing an obstacle in Stokes flow is possible solely by hydrodynamic interactions if the flow and obstacle geometry break fore-aft symmetries. The net deflection is maximal for certain initial conditions and we analytically describe its scaling with particle size, obstacle shape, and flow geometry, confirmed by direct trajectory simulations. For realistic parameters, separation by particle size is comparable to what is found assuming contact (roughness) interactions. Our approach also makes systematic predictions on when short-range attractive forces lead to particle capture or sticking. In separating hydrodynamic effects on particle motion strictly from contact interactions, we provide novel, rigorous guidelines for elementary microfluidic particle manipulation and filtering.

Conclusion: 该方法为壁面湍流模拟开辟了新途径，有助于深入理解壁面微起伏在触发湍流转捩中的作用。

Abstract: We present a two-level (fluid-kinetic) coupling procedure for the simulation of wall-bounded flows at Reynolds numbers up to thousands. The method combines a kinetic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) treatment of the near-wall layer, with a high-order Lattice-Boltzmann (HOLB) scheme as a fluid solver in the bulk flow. Given the kinetic nature of HOLB, this coupling is expected to provide a physically accurate treatment of the near-wall instabilities which trigger the transition to turbulence above a critical threshold around $Re_c \sim 750$.
  The coupled DSMC-HOLB solver is validated by simulating plane Poiseuille and Couette flows far from equilibrium, i.e at finite Knudsen number regimes. Based on this validation, we provide the first preliminary evidence that the combination of HOLB and DSMC permits to observe the regeneration cycles of coherent structures which arise above a critical value of the Reynolds number. This task would be hardly attainable by either of the two solvers separately; while DSMC can capture strong near-wall non-equilibrium effects, it lacks the compute power to deal with both near-wall and bulk flow at the same time. We look to HOLB to make it computationally feasible to perform such a simulation. The present two-level coupling procedure may pave the way to a new generation of fluid-kinetic simulations of wall-bounded turbulent flows, thus helping to gain deeper insights into the role of wall micro-corrugations in triggering the dynamic instabilities that drive the transition to turbulent regimes.

Abstract: We investigate the modal and non-modal linear amplification mechanisms in the flow over a subsonic open cavity and their subsequent interactions to identify optimal flow perturbations that propagate downstream the cavity and trigger flow transitions. Using both the stationary and time-varying base flows from a Direct Numerical Simulation of a cavity flow at Mach 0.6, we employ classical and harmonic resolvent analyses to explain the role of the cavity-generated perturbations in destabilizing the flow downstream. Our analysis of perturbation amplification about the mean flow identifies structures that resemble Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves at the Rossiter frequency in the attached boundary layer region after the cavity. A low-frequency centrifugal instability dominates inside the cavity. The mean flow also amplifies stationary streaks via a lift-up mechanism that extends throughout the boundary layer region downstream of the cavity. The harmonic resolvent analysis (HRA) reveals the amplification of additional perturbations by the unsteady Rossiter base flow. By restricting the input and output at the same frequency in the HRA, we find the amplification of the stationary perturbation to be the most dominant 3D instability mechanism. This amplification is driven by the interaction of the 3D streaks with the unsteady Rossiter base flow, which generates internal forcing in the form of oblique T-S waves, thereby further amplifying the streaks. The interaction between the centrifugal perturbation and the unsteady flow also generates streamwise elongated structures in the boundary layer region after the cavity. Together, the centrifugal-Rossiter and streak-Rossiter interactions synergistically amplify perturbations downstream of the cavity.

Abstract: A mathematical model is derived for the dynamics of a cylinder, or wheel, rolling over a thin viscous film. The model combines the Reynolds lubrication equation for the fluid with an equation of motion for the wheel. Two asymptotic limits are studied in detail to interrogate the dynamics of levitation: an infinitely wide wheel and a relatively narrow one. In both cases the front and back of the fluid-filled gap are either straight or nearly so. To bridge the gap between these two asymptotic limits, wheels of finite width are considered, introducing a further simplying approximation: although the front and back are no longer expected to remain straight for a finite width, the footprint of the fluid-filled gap is still taken to be rectangular, with boundary conditions imposed at the front and back in a wheel-averaged sense. The Reynolds equation can then be solved by separation of variables. For wider wheels, with a large amount of incoming flux or a relatively heavy loading of the wheel, the system is prone to flooding by back flow with fluid unable to pass underneath. Otherwise steady planing states are achieved. Both lift-off and touch-down are explored for a wheel rolling over a film of finite length. Theoretical predictions are compared with a set of experimental data.

Abstract: Wall-pressure fluctuations in turbulent boundary layers drive flow-induced noise, structural vibration, and hydroacoustic disturbances, especially in underwater and aerospace systems. Accurate prediction of their wavenumber-frequency spectra is critical for mitigation and design, yet empirical/analytical models rely on simplifying assumptions and miss the full spatiotemporal complexity, while high-fidelity simulations are prohibitive at high Reynolds numbers. Experimental measurements, though accessible, typically provide only pointwise signals and lack the resolution to recover full spatiotemporal fields. We propose a probabilistic generative framework that couples a patchwise (domain-decomposed) conditional neural field with a latent diffusion model to synthesize spatiotemporal wall-pressure fields under varying pressure-gradient conditions. The model conditions on sparse surface-sensor measurements and a low-cost mean-pressure descriptor, supports zero-shot adaptation to new sensor layouts, and produces ensembles with calibrated uncertainty. Validation against reference data shows accurate recovery of instantaneous fields and key statistics.

TL;DR: 本文改进了Wilcox k-ω湍流模型，通过引入基于物理信息的神经网络(PINN)来优化湍流扩散项建模，提出了k-ω-PINN-NN模型，在多种流动条件下显著改善了湍流动能的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wilcox k-ω湍流模型虽然能较好地预测湍流边界层，但普遍存在湍流动能预测过低的问题。通过与DNS数据对比发现，问题主要源于湍流扩散项的不准确建模。

Method: 将湍流扩散常数σ_k设为y/δ的函数，使用PINN求解湍流粘度的常微分方程，在耗散项和ω方程中分别引入新系数CK,NN和Cω2,NN，最终通过神经网络使所有系数成为两个新输入参数的函数。

Result: 新开发的k-ω-PINN-NN模型在Reτ=550至10,000的通道流和平板边界层流动中，均能产生优异的流速和湍流动能剖面，在周期山丘流动预测中也与DNS数据吻合良好。

Conclusion: 通过结合PINN和神经网络方法改进湍流扩散建模，成功解决了传统两方程湍流模型湍流动能预测不足的问题，新模型在多种复杂流动条件下均表现出色。

Abstract: The Wilcox $k-ω$ turbulence model predicts turbulent boundary layers well, both fully-developed channel flows and flat-plate boundary layers. However, it predicts too low a turbulent kinetic energy. This is a feature it shares with most other two-equation turbulence models. When comparing the terms in the $k$ equations with DNS data it is found that the production and dissipation terms are well predicted but the turbulent diffusion is not.
  In the present work the poor modeling of the turbulent diffusion is improved by making the turbulent diffusion constant, $σ_k$, a function of $y/δ$ ($y$ and $δ$ denote wall distance and boundary-layer thickness, respectively). The $k$ equation is turned into an ordinary differential equation for the turbulent viscosity which is solved using Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN). A new coefficient, $C_{K,NN}(y/δ)$, is added to the dissipation term and another, $C_{ω2,NN}(y/δ)$, to the destruction term in the $ω$ equation. Finally, all three coefficients -- $σ_{k,NN},$,$C_{K,NN}$ and $C_{ω2,NN}$ -- are made functions of two new input parameters, $\overline{|u'v'|}_{tot}/u_τ^2$ and $ν_t/(y u_τ)$, in a Neural Network (NN) model.
  The new turbulence model, called the $k-ω$-PINN-NN model, is shown to produce excellent velocity and turbulent kinetic profiles in channel flow at $Re_τ= 550$, $2\, 000$, $5\, 200$ and $Re_τ= 10\, 000$ as well as in flat-plate boundary layer flow. The $k-ω$-PINN-NN model is also used for predicting the flow over a periodic hill and the agreement with DNS is very good. The Python PINN and NN scripts and the Python CFD codes can be downloaded (Davidson, 2025a).

Abstract: This second part of the study develops a geometric and asymptotic description of how surface tension governs the modulational stability of interfacial waves in a two-layer fluid. Extending the analytical framework of Part~I, surface tension is treated as a freely adjustable parameter, enabling one to trace how nonlinear and dispersive properties evolve across a broad range of depth ratios and density contrasts. Using the nonlinear Schrödinger reduction together with long-wave asymptotics, the mechanisms shaping the boundaries between stable and unstable regimes are identified and their dependence on surface tension is quantified.
  The long-wave structure is governed by two density values that determine the bases of the loop and the corridor on the stability diagrams. Their ordering switches only when the lower layer is deeper, and loop-type structures arise exclusively in this regime. A second organising parameter is the classical Bond threshold, at which the dispersive and nonlinear singularities coincide. When surface tension exceeds this value and the upper layer is sufficiently deep, resonant and dispersive effects generate a capillary cut that replaces the corridor and characterises strongly capillary, upper-layer-dominated configurations.
  To unify these observations, full three-dimensional critical surfaces separating different types of nonlinear and dispersive behaviour are computed. The loop, corridor, and cut arise as planar sections of these surfaces, and their transitions follow from the deformation of the intersection between the resonant and dispersive sheets. Two depth ratios correspond to geometric degeneracies: equal layer depths, where the intersection reduces to a straight line, and the golden-ratio configuration, where the critical surface becomes horizontally tangent at the Bond threshold.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of surface acoustic wave (SAW)-induced acoustic streaming are highly sensitive to the choice of second-order boundary conditions. This study systematically compares the no-slip (NS) and Stokes slip (SD) boundary conditions through different numerical approaches. Two- and three-dimensional simulations based on the Reynolds stress method are performed for standing SAW and travelling SAW devices. Results are validated against particle image velocimetry measurements of streaming patterns and velocities. We show that the SD condition yields Lagrangian velocity fields in significantly better agreement with experiments than the NS condition, accurately capturing vortex number, rotation direction, and amplitude across varying device geometries and operating conditions. In contrast, the NS condition overpredicts velocities by 1-2 orders of magnitude and often fails to reproduce experimentally observed vortex structures. These findings highlight the essential role of the Stokes drift boundary condition in modelling acoustic streaming and provide clear guidance for its use in future simulations of SAW-based acoustofluidic systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to solve the modal form of the linearised one-way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations for investigating disturbance development in developing subsonic and supersonic boundary layers. The modal framework offers significant advantages in robustness and computational efficiency over the conventional non-modal OWNS framework. Notably, we demonstrate that modal OWNS (M-OWNS) retains the capability to capture non-modal disturbance development. Our technique leverages the modal ansatz of parabolised stability equations (PSE) whilst employing the recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy of non-modal OWNS to stabilise the streamwise-marching modal algorithm. A key contribution is that we overcome the minimum streamwise step-size requirement that constrains conventional PSE in capturing short-scale disturbance evolution. We demonstrate through canonical test cases that fine-scale variations in the baseflow can be captured effectively. The M-OWNS procedure permits arbitrarily small streamwisemarching step-sizes whilst maintaining stability. Crucially, we find the algorithm to be more robust than conventional non-modal OWNS, whilst recovering identical modal and non-modal phenomena.

Abstract: Ocean eddy dipoles are among the most common mesoscale features and may be ubiquitous across the global oceans. However, wave-current interactions in their proximity have not been extensively studied. Here we examine the impact of surface currents on the wave field near an ocean eddy dipole. Using the WW3 wave model, we conducted idealized numerical simulations to assess the influence of different configurations on the spatial variability of Significant Wave Height ($H_s$). Additionally, a two-month hindcast of a strong dipole event in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean was performed using three distinct surface current products: SSalto/Duacs, HYCOM NCODA and GlobCurrent. Among these, HYCOM, which incorporates ageostrophic effects, provided a more detailed representation of oceanic energy compared to GlobCurrent and SSalto/Duacs, which primarily reflect geostrophic components. The hindcast assessment employed denoised altimeter-derived $H_s$ data, with a spatial resolution of approximately 6~km. The greatest increase in wave energy occurs in the region between the peak values of positive and negative vorticity, where the opposing surface currents reach their maximum intensity. Therefore, dipoles act as converging lenses for surface waves, channeling their refraction towards the central jet. Despite its poorer spatial and temporal resolutions, SSalto-Duacs surface current data provides more reliable $H_s$ fields, in the study region where geostrophic dynamics are expected to be significant or even dominant.
  HYCOM captures a broader range of dynamical processes, essential for accurately representing the total energy, though discrepancies with SSalto/Duacs data may arise from assimilation inaccuracies and model limitations.

Abstract: While experiencing atmospheric turbulence on a commercial flight can be uncomfortable, it rarely compromises the stability of the aircraft. The situation is quite different for small air vehicles that operate in urban canyons, around mountainous terrains, and in the wakes of marine vessels, where they could encounter highly unsteady atmospheric conditions with relatively strong gusts. The spatiotemporal scales of such disturbances can be larger than the characteristic aerodynamic scales of the small vehicles, making the relative effect of disturbance significantly stronger than what a large commercial aircraft would experience. The gust ratio can exceed 1 in these extreme flight environments, making stable flight difficult, if not currently impossible. We refer to the study of aerodynamics for gust ratios over 1, extreme aerodynamics, and identify major challenges that require breakthroughs, particularly with data-driven approaches. Extreme aerodynamics present unique opportunities for innovative analysis techniques to study rich flow physics problems with strong nonlinearity, transient dynamics, and low-dimensional modeling over a large parameter space. Some of the approaches discussed herein should apply to a wider range of fluid dynamics problems with similar challenges.

Abstract: This study numerically examines the steady unconfined laminar flow of incompressible non-Newtonian power-law fluids past a pair of side-by-side counter-rotating circular cylinders using the finite element method. The cylinders simultaneously rotate at equal angular speeds in opposite directions, with the upper cylinder (UC) rotating clockwise and the lower cylinder (LC) counterclockwise. The numerical simulations are performed over wide parameter ranges: power-law index ($0.2 \le n \le 1.8$), rotational rate ($0 \le α\le 2$), gap ratio ($0.2 \le G \le 1$), and Reynolds number ($1 \le Re \le 40$). The detailed influence of these flow parameters on key flow characteristics, including streamlines, surface pressure, centerline velocity, and individual as well as total drag and lift coefficients, is systematically analyzed. For stationary cylinders ($α= 0$), a twin-vortex structure forms in the wake, which progressively vanishes with increasing rotation ($α= 2$). The surface pressure coefficient attains its maximum values for shear-thickening fluids ($n > 1$) at higher rotational speeds, irrespective of the gap ratio. The total drag coefficient ($C_D$) decreases with increasing $α$ and $n$, whereas the lift coefficient ($C_L$) exhibits a more intricate dependence on the flow parameters. The results provide fundamental insights into the interplay between rotation, non-Newtonian rheology, and geometric confinement in determining the hydrodynamic behavior of rotating cylinder systems.

Abstract: Electrokinetic flows in microchannels with opposite charge asymmetry, i.e., unequal and contrasting surface charges on opposing channel walls, significantly influence microfluidic hydrodynamics and can be exploited for enhanced control of mass transfer, mixing, and heat transport in microfluidic applications. This study numerically investigates electroviscous flow of a liquid electrolyte through an oppositely charged non-uniform microslit. The governing Poisson, Nernst-Planck, and Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the finite element method to determine the coupled electrokinetic fields for a wide range of dimensionless parameters: Reynolds number (Re = 0.01), Schmidt number (Sc = 1000), inverse Debye length (K = 2-20), top-wall surface charge density (St = 4-16), surface charge density ratio (Sr = -2 to 0), and contraction ratio (dc = 0.25). For completeness, results for like-charged devices, where both walls carry surface charges of the same sign (Sr = 0-2), are also included. The results show that maximum enhancement in total electrical potential (|ΔU|) and pressure drop (|ΔP|) reaches 296.82% at K = 20, St = 4, -2 \le Sr \le -1.25, and 14.57% at St = 16, Sr = 0, K = 2-20, respectively. The electroviscous correction factor Y exhibits maximum increases of 14.02% at K = 2, St = 16; 11.81% at K = 2, Sr = 0; and 14.57% at Sr = 0, St = 16, when Sr increases (-0.75 to 0), St increases (4 to 16), and K decreases (20 to 2), respectively. The overall maximum increment in Y is 15.13% at K = 2, Sr = 0, St = 16, relative to the non-electroviscous flow case. These findings demonstrate that opposite charge asymmetry, though weaker than similar asymmetry, still strongly influences electroviscous flow in non-uniform microchannels.

Abstract: Spinning ice discs in nature have been reported for more than a century, yet laboratory experiments have yielded diverse observations and contradictory explanations, leaving the mechanism behind the disc motion elusive. Here we combine numerical simulations and scaling analysis to investigate a freely moving ice disc in a lab-scale water tank. We observe the disc remaining stationary or experiencing spontaneous motion, depending on the disc-water temperature difference and water depth. The motion is initiated by a buoyancy-driven, downward plume arising from water's density anomaly -- its density peaks near $4^\circ$C. Crucially, the plume breaks rotational and mirror symmetries after descending beyond a critical distance due to a thermoconvective instability, thereby inducing the disc to move autonomously. Our findings quantitatively unify disc behaviors observed across independent experiments and establish a predictive criterion for the onset of disc motion. More broadly, we point to a route for thermally-driven transport: coupling of bulk thermoconvection and moving bodies, relevant to geophysical processes such as continental drift and iceberg capsizing.

Abstract: The behaviour of internal waves propagating in a background shear flow is studied in the case where the direction of shear is orthogonal to gravity. Ray-tracing theory is used to predict properties of the wave state at locations where instability occurs. It is found that local wave energy growth may result from two distinct mechanisms: an increase in wave steepness due to refraction by the shear, or an increase in streamwise velocity perturbations due to wave advection of the background flow. Based on the initial conditions, a dimensionless parameter $F$ is constructed to predict the relative importance of these two mechanisms in facilitating wave-breaking according to the local ratio of perturbation kinetic to potential energy. When $F$ is small but wave amplitudes are locally large, energy remains equipartitioned and subsequent instabilities are expected to develop due to a combination of shear and convection. On the other hand, as $F$ increases, kinetic energy dominates and wave advection of momentum may instead cause breaking to become increasingly driven by enhanced vertical shear. To test these predictions, fully nonlinear direct numerical simulations are conducted, spanning a range of wave-breaking dynamics. Good qualitative agreement with the theory is found despite substantial departures from the underlying assumptions. Wave breaking leads to significant turbulent dissipation, which in some cases greatly exceeds the initial wave energy. Momentum and energy transfers between the wave, background flow and turbulence are found to be sensitive to the dynamics of breaking, as are the mixing properties.

Abstract: To explore the combined effects of partial thermal stable stratification and magnetic back-reaction within Earth's tangent cylinder, we study the onset of magnetoconvection in an infinite plane layer subject to horizontal magnetic field imposed perpendicular to the rotation axis. Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are considered to examine their influence on convective onset. A broad range of rotation rates and diffusivity ratios captures the effects of rotation and thermal-to-magnetic diffusivity contrast, while magnetic back-reaction is analyzed by varying the imposed magnetic field strength. To assess the impact of stratification on convection threshold and flow structure, we derive local scaling laws for critical onset parameters and compute penetration percentages to quantify convective intrusion into the stable layer. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in rotation-dominated regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, faster rotation enhances columnarity and intensifies stratification effects while delaying onset. Under strong magnetic fields, thicker rolls persist even at rapid rotation, with limited but noticeable penetration into the stable layer. Magnetic stabilization is more effective at low to moderate diffusivity ratios but weakens at high diffusivity ratio. Penetration decreases with stronger magnetic fields and rotation, especially under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weak stratification and magnetic regimes. These findings highlight the complex interplay among stratification, rotation, and magnetic field strength in setting the onset and structure of rotating convection relevant to planetary interiors.

Abstract: This study examines the onset of rotating magnetoconvection under an axially imposed magnetic field in the presence of partial thermal stable stratification. Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are analyzed across Ekman numbers $E = 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}$, and $10^{-5}$ (rotation rates) and Roberts numbers $q = 0.01, 1$ and $10$ (diffusivity ratios). Magnetic back-reaction is explored by varying the Elsasser number ($Λ$) from 0 to 10. Symmetry-breaking effects of stable layer are assessed via an asymmetry index. Additionally, local scaling laws are derived for onset parameters and convective penetration is quantified numerically. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in weak field regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, symmetry breaking is pronounced but weakens for strong field regime. Convective roll thickening peaks at $Λ= 1$, while columnarity persists in both weak and strong field regimes due to rotational constraints and elongation effects along imposed field direction, respectively. Magnetic stabilization is most effective at low to moderate values of $q$ but weakens in high $q$ regimes. Penetration depth is inversely related to the magnetic field strength and rotation rates, particularly under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weakly stratified cases. In the non-magnetic limit, the critical Ekman number $E_c$, exhibiting maximum penetration effects, is obtained as $E_c = 10^{-4}$ for weak stable stratification and $E_c = 10^{-3}$ for strong stable stratification. Obtained results can provide insights into the complex interplay of various geophysical effects on planetary interiors.

Abstract: One challenge in developing a statistical field theory of turbulence is the analysis of the functional equations that govern the complete statistics of the flow field. Simplified models of turbulence may help to develop such a statistical framework. Here, we consider the advection and stretching of an incompressible passive vector field by a spatially linear stochastic field as a model for small-scale turbulence. The model encompasses non-Gaussian statistics due to an intermittent energy flux from large scales to small scales, thereby displaying hallmark features of turbulence. We explore this model using the Hopf functional formalism, which naturally leads to a decomposition of the complex non-Gaussian statistics into Gaussian sub-ensembles based on different realizations of the advecting field. We then characterize intermittency of the model using a numerical implementation, which takes advantage of this statistical decomposition.

Abstract: Flow networks are fundamental for understanding systems such as animal and plant vasculature or power distribution grids. These networks can encode, transmit, and transform information embodied in the spatial and temporal distribution of their flows. In this work, we focus on a minimal yet physically grounded system that allows us to isolate the fundamental mechanisms by which active flow networks generate and regulate emergent dynamics capable of supporting information transmission. The system is composed of active units that pump fluid and elastic units that store volume. From first principles, we derive a discrete model-an active flow network-that enables the simulation of large systems with many interacting units. Numerically, we show that the pressure field can develop solitary waves, resulting in the spontaneous creation and transmission of localized packets of information stored in the physical properties of the flow. We characterize how these solitary waves emerge from disordered initial conditions in a one-dimensional network, and how their size and propagation speed depend on key system parameters. Finally, when the elastic units are coupled to their neighbors, the solitary waves exhibit even richer dynamics, with diverse shapes and finite lifetimes that display power-law behaviors that we can predict analytically. Together, these results show how simple fluidic elements can collectively create, shape and transport information, laying the foundations for understanding-and ultimately engineering-information processing in active flow systems.

Abstract: The direction and magnitude of energy transfer between turbulence scale brought about by external forcing on a turbulent boundary layer are uncovered through the bispectrum, bicoherence, and biphase. The bispectrum is a third-order, complex-valued spectrum of the streamwise velocity that preserves the phase information between triadically consistent scales. Normalized bispectrum is the bicoherence, a measure of the relative amount of energy at a higher frequency that results from quadratic phase coupling of two lower frequencies. The phase of the bispectrum, the biphase, measures the phase lag between the high frequency and two lower frequencies that add to it, unveiling whether a triadic interaction produces a forward or reverse cascade of energy. Summing the bispectrum over triadically consistent frequencies allows a spectral decomposition of the velocity skewness and asymmetry, unveiling the triadically active scales in the energy transfer processes. An average sense of energy transfer is inferred from the phase of this skewness spectrum, which shows that scales smaller than the boundary layer thickness contribute to a forward cascade on average, while those larger than the boundary layer thickness have a mix of forward and reverse events. These measures show that the forced scales in the perturbed boundary layer have a mixture of forward and reverse energy transfer processes for different sets of triadic scales and wall-normal locations, providing a method of quantifying the effects of external perturbations on turbulent flows without any need for artificial filtering.
