The PDE model is a nonlinear, coupled system of two\nequations in two variables (attractiveness of residential sites and density of\ncriminals), similar to the Keller-Segel model for aggregation based on\nchemotaxis. Unlike previous works, which applied periodic boundary conditions,\nwe enforce boundary conditions that arise naturally from the variational\nformulation of the PDE problem, i.e., the starting point for the application of\na finite element method. These conditions specify the value of the normal\nderivatives of the system variables at the boundary. For the numerical solution\nof the PDE problem discretized in time and space, we propose a scheme that\ndecouples the computation of the attractiveness from the computation of the\ncriminal density at each time step, resulting in the solution of two linear\nalgebraic systems per iteration.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow\nimages that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or\ndevice-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where\nthe objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity\nfield, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed\nnoisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two\nsubproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem\nleverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field\nfrom noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims\nto infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping\nthat deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an\nalternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field\nand the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality\nreconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through\nexperiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under\nvarying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic\ngeometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness\nand robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to\nassess the influence of key hyperparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53bb\u566a\u8840\u6d41\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u6c42\u89e3\u6d41\u4f53\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u8840\u6d41\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u96c6\u6216\u8bbe\u5907\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6d41\u4f53\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u91cd\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff09\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u5171\u5f62\u6620\u5c04\u63a8\u65ad\u6d41\u52a8\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u8840\u6d41\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To achieve this,\nexperience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally\nexpensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts\nhave been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most\ntime-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on\ntheory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and\nintegrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to\nautomatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning\ntime. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by\nlearning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we\nintegrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed\nfor LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability\nissue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop\nvirtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy\nnetwork, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The\ninner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based\non objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in\nthis study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves\nthe effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively.

To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation\nframeworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the\nrelations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general\nnon-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been\nrecently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions\ncannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated\nfor ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate\ndesirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak\nadmissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the\ncentral modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak\nadmissibility.

Each institution must incrementally update models\nusing only local data. Traditional training overfits new samples and suffers\nfrom catastrophic forgetting, losing previously acquired knowledge. Medical\ndata distributions also shift due to varying diagnostic equipment and\ndemographics. Although continual learning (CL) has advanced, most methods\naddress natural images, leaving medical-domain-specific CL underexplored. We\npropose a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach featuring a unified\nprompt pool with a minimal expansion strategy: by expanding and freezing a\nsubset of prompts, our method reduces computational overhead, and a novel\nregularization term balances retention and adaptation.

This domain enables predictive\nidentification of key transitional events in the Nusselt number profile,\nincluding local extrema and slope inflections, across all inclination angles.\nThe analysis reveals that oblique displacement of active saddle points enhances\nheat transfer by promoting the shedding of repelling LCSs, while parallel\ndisplacement leads to weakened heat transfer due to the delayed detachment of\nrepelling coherent structures. The proposed framework enables the construction\nof a temporal function that closely replicates the monotonicity and\ntransitional features of the Nusselt number evolution. Furthermore, threshold\ndisplacement metrics are defined for dominant repelling LCSs to correspond with\npeak heat transfer efficiency.

While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image\noffers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial\nscene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)\nhave recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we\nextend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel\nre-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,\nwithout requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce\nPAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based\nRPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement\nstrategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on\nindoor benchmarks.

To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several\ncontinual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to\nefficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining\nlearned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on\nthe update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic\nDistillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of\nlearned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently\noutperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,\n1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with\nmethods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal\nperformance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive\nembedding dimensions in CKGE.

Since the virtual element method allows the use of\narbitrary polygonal elements, the inherent mesh flexibility of VEM allows\nlocalized mesh modifications without affecting global mesh structure, making it\nparticularly effective for the analysis of electronic packaging reliability\ninvolving complex geometries and multiple geometric scales. The approach\nimplements a novel non-matching mesh generation strategy that strategically\ncombines polygonal meshes for complex small-scale regions with regular\nquadrilateral meshes for larger domains. The VEM formulation addresses both\nheat conduction and thermomechanical coupling problems, with comprehensive\nverification through analytical benchmarks and practical electronic packaging\ncase studies, including Through-Silicon Via (TSV), Ball Grid Array (BGA), and\nPlastic Ball Grid Array (PBGA) structures.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic\ninteractive GUI environments.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the\nvarying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy\noptimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based\nsignals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced\nfeedback during training.

The framework\ncomprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal\nGenerator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate\nhigh-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)\nDenoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors\nfrom annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to\nthe state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our\napproach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating\nthe superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D\ncan serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also\nas a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary\ndetection or annotation pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHQ-OV3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5c01\u95ed\u5f0f3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408IMCV\u63d0\u6848\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548cACA\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7c7b\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u4f18\u5316\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u7c7b\u4e0amAP\u63d0\u53477.37%\uff0c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HQ-OV3D\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6216\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Advanced mathematical models governing these\ncoupled processes typically combine fluid flow, poroelasticity, and fracture\ncontact mechanics, representing fractures as co-dimension one objects within\nthe porous medium.

As a result, convergence issues with nonlinear solvers are common,\nwhich hinders the practical implementation of such models.\n  One particular source of difficulty for the nonlinear solvers comes from the\nfracture contact mechanics, due to its inherently nonsmooth character. In this\npaper, we investigate solvers based on the augmented Lagrangian formulation of\nthe frictional contact problem. This includes two classical solvers, namely the\ngeneralized Newton method (using complementarity functions) and the return map\nmethod. In addition, we propose a new augmented Lagrangian solver that combines\nthe two approaches.\n  Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to assess the\nperformance of the solvers on problems of mixed-dimensional poromechanics with\nfracture contact mechanics. The experiments indicate that for simpler setups,\nthe solvers behave quite predictably and in accordance with established\nheuristics from the contact mechanics literature. However, as the complexity of\nthe problem increases, the solvers become more unpredictable, and break with\nthese heuristics.

While prior work on SLTH showed that pruning allows approximation of\na certain class of neural networks, we demonstrate that, in the quantized\nsetting, the analogous class of target discrete neural networks can be\nrepresented exactly, and we prove optimal bounds on the necessary\noverparameterization of the initial network as a function of the precision of\nthe target network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5f3a\u5f69\u7968\u5047\u8bbe\uff08SLTH\uff09\u5230\u91cf\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u79bb\u6563\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u7f51\u7edc\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eBorgs\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u6570\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u91cf\u5316\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55SLTH\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u6709\u9650\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u79bb\u6563\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u88ab\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u521d\u59cb\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u754c\u9650\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86SLTH\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

However, in extreme degradation scenarios\n(e.g., scale $> 8\\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often\nseverely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models\nto reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to\ngenerate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images\nlacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nFSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID\nrestoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.\nOur approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region\nin the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)\n\\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style\nguidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)\nimages for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first\npretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing\nit to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity\nembeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform\nlightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID\nimages. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID\ninformation, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual\nquality.

We address these limitations by\nintroducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval\npredictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs\nprediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty\nsets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors\ncan be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can\napply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we\nfocus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression\ntasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification\nsettings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible\nclasses. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for\ndetecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical\nexperiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than\ninterval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while\nachieving a similar coverage over the test data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3azono-conformal prediction\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4bzonotopes\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u6355\u6349\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165zono-conformal prediction\uff0c\u5c06zonotopic\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u7ebf\u6027\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0czono-conformal predictors\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5c11\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "zono-conformal prediction\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u8282\u7701\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Adaptation\nto prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and\ncitizenship modification.\n  Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained\nbias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios\nand topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e14\u4e3b\u9898\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6781\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af-\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u6218\u4e89\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u654f\u611f\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6781\u5316\u654f\u611f\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5bf9\u4e4c\u514b\u5170\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u666e\u904d\u66f4\u79ef\u6781\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6781\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u8865\u3002"}}

Alerting to the presence of these objects is\ntherefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and\ntriggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a\nspecial kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and\nmachine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform\nappearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this\nproblem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,\na distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but\ngeometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with\nthis problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of\norientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an\nArtcode.

The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation\nstudies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial\ntraining results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that\neffectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,\nIPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for\nconstructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced\nreasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of\nthis study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization\nnot only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such\nas autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models\nmust remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u589e\u91cf\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\uff08IPG\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad811.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eIPG\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u5bf9AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u91cf\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\uff08IPG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5982YOLO\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "IPG\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "IPG\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u9632\u5fa1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u5b89\u9632\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While current VQA benchmarks\nconsider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically\nblend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of\nreasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic\nevaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning\nlevels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by\nprior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this\nbenchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object\nproperties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based\nquestions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings\nreveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing\nmodel only reaching 40\\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic\n(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional\nproperties, and higher counts.

Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited\nto single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image\nintegration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive\nnature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce\nMedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language\nmodels on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four\nkey features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,\nmulti-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core\ntasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn\nquestion answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease\ndiagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates\ntemporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging\nmodalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to\nperform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts.

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)\nto generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns\nacross large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to\ncapture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their\ndiagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of\npersonalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors\nbased on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past\nquestion-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that\neffectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task\nis challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which\noften lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based\ngroup-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free\ntwo-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific\nmisconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover\nthe student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second\nstage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new\nquestions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with\nthe student's recurring misconceptions.

Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for\nfiltering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However,\nsimultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations\nremains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated\nindependently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions\nbetween items and user preferences.

A graph attention mechanism dynamically\nweights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture\nof key interactions and generating precise representations for both user\npreferences and outfit compatibility.

While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model.

However, due to the parameter explosion and data\nsparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order\nfeature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the\noccurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence\nBayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,\nNeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn\ndistributional representations of feature values and parameterize the\nconditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic\ngradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model\nefficiently.

This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini\nPro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty\npragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions\nare framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and\nuniversity student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for\nsentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that\noptimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all\noutputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values.\nGratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as\nanger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly\ninfluenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels\nof negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama\ndemonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental\nhealth condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts\nelicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated\nelevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while\nstress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with\nelevated joy and trust.

This potential has\nbeen partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various\nfine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned\nvariants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data\nthat often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional\nshifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range\nof medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a\ntraining-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both\ngeneralist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical\nimage segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that\nrely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we\npropose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal\nlayer-wise merging solutions.

With AI, we can now extract detailed\nmeasurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D\nclinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define\nbody composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using\nlarge-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms\nabdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through\nsegmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random\nforest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection\nthrough SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns\n(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences\n(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.\nThere were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal\nmuscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or\nfat-laden pancreas.

However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and\ntransmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which\nlimits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection\n(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain\nadaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training\nparadigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse\ncaused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense\nobjects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain\nannotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision\nfoundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised\nframework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision\nFoundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a \"free lunch\" manner,\nleveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise\nwhile improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we\nintroduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's\nsemantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated\npseudo-labels.

This is a challenging\nproblem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the\nnewly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.\nMost CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery\nand classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the\nprocess of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use\nknowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more\nstorage space.

Extensive experiments on\nfour challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently\noutperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known\nclasses and generalizing to unknown classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e0b\u6e38\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9002\u914d\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5c06\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLatHAdapter\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "LatHAdapter\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and\npatch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly\nallocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in\nlow-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging\nwithout explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this\nwork, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video\ntokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We\nfirst extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a\nset of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian\nEmbedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D\nGaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,\nlower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information\ncontent during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding\nper-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a\nGaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into\nstatic and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across\ndifferent time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a\ncompact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,\nwhile also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression\nusing the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets.

We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation.

To support model\ntraining and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question\nanswering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples\ncovering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,\ntransportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results\nshow that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the\nQwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which\nis 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT\nimproves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical\ntasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical\nflexibility and the robustness of inference.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable\noptimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than\nsurrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds\nfor DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,\nthat computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can\nbe performed using feedforward neural network layers.

However, existing methods struggle to align with\nfine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion\nnaturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference.

To address this, we present a\nnovel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy\nversus on-policy lens.

Based on an\nanalysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular\nlevels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the\nframework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the\ntransition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies\na token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert\ntokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from\noff-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,\nproviding empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient\nlearning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with\non-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over\nbaselines.

However, existing methods for CBT learning\nsuch as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nhindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due\nto their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive\nfocus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the\ngenerated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory\nCOgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)\nto learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD\n(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow\nfor tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling\nthe modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By\nintegrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO\ncaptures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process\ninformation and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:\n(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional\nconnectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to\nthe best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity\nstudies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive\nreservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show\nthat our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms\nof centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory\nmemory retention.

However, monocular\nendoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,\nincluding depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent\nendoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To\novercome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue\nreconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with\ntemporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework\nincorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust\ninitialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in\nconjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth\nestimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel\ncorrespondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on\nLPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from\nphysiological tissue deformation and motion.

A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object\nmotion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories.

This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing\ngeometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant\nobjects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address\nthis, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable\nspatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency\nTracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified\nspatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative\ntrajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our\ncue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature\nrepresentations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a\ndynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for\nstable online tracking.

In this work, we present Holistic Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds\nexplanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those\nexplanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,\nlearning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a\nsingle taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,\ndata analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;\nour survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in\ntheories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and\nfindings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that\nmake explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a\nMeta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise\noffset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to\nreplace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the\neffectiveness of NoOp.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNoOp\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08DC\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u5339\u914d\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u539f\u5219\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08DC\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4e0d\u540c\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u7c7b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNoOp\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3Meta-Network\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u66ff\u4ee3\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNoOp\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "NoOp\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DC\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

When adopting a transformer-based detection model to\nperform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning\nthe detection performance on previously learned categories may severely\ndegenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)\nto mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based\ndetection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a\ncorrespondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase\ndetection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched\nqueries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,\nHungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of\nthe current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at\ndifferent iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each\nquery may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of\npreviously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we\npropose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation\n(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD\nestablishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase\nmodels that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned\ndistillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of\nprevious categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic\nand spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new\ncategories.

This paper then proposes a semantics-guided\nframework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge\ntransfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate\nseveral state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity\nsources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect\nto the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our\nexperiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these\nmodels consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static\nlexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class\nrelationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a\npreliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \\textit{a\npriori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models\nfor constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial\nbenchmarks across architectures and datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u7b7e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6216\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528BERT\u3001TinyLLAMA\u548cCLIP\u7b49\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u6700\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u4f73\u548c\u6700\u5dee\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff08\u5982WordNet\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u7c7b\u522b\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

While supervised deep\nlearning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on\nextensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical\nworkflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often\nstruggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In\nthis study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot\nsegmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first\ntrains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to\nproduce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically\nprocessed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,\nwhich are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The\nproposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice\ncoefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that\nCoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated\nwith conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation\nresults.

Ablation studies confirm the\nsynergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests\nindicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise\ninterference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for\nautomated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical\nengineering value.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faYOLOv11-KW-TA-FP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001KernelWarehouse\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u4e09\u91cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548cFP-IoU\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u88c2\u7f1d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u6c5f\u4e09\u89d2\u6d32\u5730\u533a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8001\u5316\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u88c2\u7f1d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eYOLOv11n\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001KernelWarehouse\u5377\u79ef\uff08KWConv\uff09\u3001\u4e09\u91cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08TA\uff09\u548cFP-IoU\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u738791.3%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u738776.6%\uff0cmAP@50\u8fbe86.4%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this\nfield, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)\nlack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for\nsufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data\npreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports\nbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to\nlearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet\nlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual\nfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive\nloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an\nunsupervised manner.

In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while\npreserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this\nbehavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal\ninformation is integrated within the model.

This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges\nfrom inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,\nwhich implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we\npropose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a\ntemporal exit mechanism for early token truncation.

However, existing approaches struggle\nto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended\nsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in\nadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently\noffers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform\ndiverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning\ncapabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20\nbenchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,\nparticularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faThyme\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0cThyme\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7SFT\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u518d\u7528RL\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faGRPO-ATS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cThyme\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Thyme\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
