One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific\ncharacteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid\nvelocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete\npoints in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or\ncomputational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data\nis ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the\nmean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.\nTherefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical\ncharacteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector\nsimilarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here\nand implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting\nproblem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in\nPIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant\nchallenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities. The\ntest case uses PIV data from the highly turbulent flow in the well-known\nTransparent Combustion Chamber III (TCC-III) engine. Loss functions based on\nthe cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences are proposed; the\nresults show that the vector-based loss functions lead to significantly\nimproved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns, while a hybrid (vector and\nmean-square error) loss function enables a good compromise to be found between\npreserving multi-scale behaviour and pixel-wise accuracy."}

They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as\nnavigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices\nfollowing the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This\ncontinuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed\nto retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches\nrequire annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient\nmethodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage\nLLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies\nmessages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple\nLLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were\nevaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score\nand 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and\n76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures\nand HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The\nprocessed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool\nthat transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to\nhealthcare professionals.

In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the\njoint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification\nmechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant\nbiasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves\naverage relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%\non KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths."}

To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data\npoints whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance\n$\\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a\nframework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural\nnetworks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small.

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions\nand propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific\ntarget. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models\nwhile significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.\nIt exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a\ngood approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original\ntraining data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be\nadapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable\nin plug-and-play scenarios."}

Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To\nmitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a\nprojection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of\neach training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis\nshows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the\nrefusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by\noverall performance barriers.

To address these limitations,\nwe propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual\nsemantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of\nCLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first\nclusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features\nretrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then\nconcatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder.

For example, a model that can change a variable name like\nuserIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index\nwithout reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and\ndiscovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned\non forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability\nto reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse.

Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial\neffort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own\nwork, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the\nassociated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify\nthe resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat\nagent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through\nnatural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that\nleverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy\nand TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses.

In addition, we predict 12\nmonths lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning\nGraph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth\ntrajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction\nreaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first\nfollow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance\nof up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more\nflexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.\nOur results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the\ncomprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal\nMRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the\ninvestigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical\ndecision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care."}

These models often leverage fundamental time series\nproperties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an\nintrinsic link between model performance and data properties.

Additionally, there\nis no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost\nexpenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream\napplications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing\nrelation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for\nrecommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we\nconstruct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a\ncomprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct\nan extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the\nrelationship between time series properties and modeling strategies.

In the present work, we establish how and when\nhallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept\nrepresentations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with\nexperimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic\nexperiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer\nmodel grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured.

At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide\nvariety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate\nactivations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we\nconfirm through targeted steering.

A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral\nimagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while\nhyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior\nhyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix\nfactorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and\nspectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based\nmodel that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while\npreserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes\nfive multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at\nthe same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors\ngrow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To\naddress this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively\nexpands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.\nMoreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and\norders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise\nrelations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework.

While several\nimproved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length\nsuffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains\nunexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that\nemploys learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.\nOur approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact\npositions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only\nreduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby\nlowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve\nsuccessful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the\noriginal GCG and several improved variants.

To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies.

This deviates from the expectation that the model should\nincrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data\nstreams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the\ndiscriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to\nrestricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class\nconfusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation\nlearning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown\nrepresentations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an\nangular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating\nexcessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt\na virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known\nrepresentations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through\nboundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification\nstrategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation\nbias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and\npositive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100\nand TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR.

One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific\ncharacteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid\nvelocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete\npoints in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or\ncomputational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data\nis ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the\nmean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.\nTherefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical\ncharacteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector\nsimilarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here\nand implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting\nproblem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in\nPIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant\nchallenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities.

Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on\nbenign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive\nrates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques\nhave demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by\nlearning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In\nparticular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the\ndistance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it\nbetween dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive\nviews through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In\ncontrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative\npairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented\nsamples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious\ndistributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This\napproach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after\npretraining on benign traffic.

By leveraging direct\naccess to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors\n(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,\ndelivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output\nthan RGB-based frame-to-event converters.\n  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable\nsimulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further\ndesign a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,\nRGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset\ncreation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams\nclosely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher\nresolution and autofocus capabilities.

We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination\nbehavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model\nchoosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual\nrecall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on\npreviously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case\nstudies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to\noverconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that\ncompared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data\nare available at https://github.com/XuZhao0/tts-knowledge"}

In practice, deep networks\noften produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode\noverlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering\ngeneralization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss\nprovide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a\nfailure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly\nquantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices\nderived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics\nagainst a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,\ninterpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.\nWe validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST\nvariants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple\narchitectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low\nrho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction\nerror, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.\nEstimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower\nbounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen\nEstimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)\ncan guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware\nregularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across\nmodels and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool\nfor evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations."}

This critical issue is often\noverlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive\nand computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we\nintroduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,\nbackpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model\ngeneralization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural\nadapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time\ndevice data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data\ndistributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The\nprototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,\nfacilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer\nknowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter\nchanges and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and\nrecommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and\ngenerality."}
