One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific\ncharacteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid\nvelocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete\npoints in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or\ncomputational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data\nis ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the\nmean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.\nTherefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical\ncharacteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector\nsimilarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here\nand implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting\nproblem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in\nPIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant\nchallenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities. The\ntest case uses PIV data from the highly turbulent flow in the well-known\nTransparent Combustion Chamber III (TCC-III) engine. Loss functions based on\nthe cosine similarity and vector magnitude differences are proposed; the\nresults show that the vector-based loss functions lead to significantly\nimproved predictions of multi-scale flow patterns, while a hybrid (vector and\nmean-square error) loss function enables a good compromise to be found between\npreserving multi-scale behaviour and pixel-wise accuracy."}

They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as\nnavigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices\nfollowing the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This\ncontinuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed\nto retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches\nrequire annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient\nmethodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage\nLLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies\nmessages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple\nLLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were\nevaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score\nand 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and\n76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures\nand HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The\nprocessed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool\nthat transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to\nhealthcare professionals.

Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled\nto produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information\nacross various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual\nrecognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the\njoint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification\nmechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant\nbiasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves\naverage relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%\non KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths."}

To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data\npoints whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance\n$\\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a\nframework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural\nnetworks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small.

Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided\ndecoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method\nselection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of\nstructured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights\nand practical guidance for LLM deployment."}

The panoramic model\nserves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates\nmulti-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose\noptimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of\nindividual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the\nmisalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we\npropose an extrinsic compensation method.

However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise\nLLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,\nraising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To\nmitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a\nprojection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of\neach training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis\nshows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the\nrefusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by\noverall performance barriers.

We\nalso reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select\nhigh-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning\nsamples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our\ncurated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,\nencourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain\n(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA\nconfigurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new\nparadigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search.

A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral\nimagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while\nhyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior\nhyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix\nfactorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and\nspectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based\nmodel that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while\npreserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes\nfive multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at\nthe same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors\ngrow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To\naddress this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively\nexpands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.\nMoreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and\norders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise\nrelations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our\nmodel achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,\noutperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by\nmore than half.

NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the\nphysical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,\nroughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is\ninefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.\nlithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models\nhave been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.\nAlthough such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when\nreplacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a\nnovel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by\nperforming gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,\nautomatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of\nthe error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these\nquantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful\nmodern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited\nin the context of neutron reflectometry.

In the present work, we establish how and when\nhallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept\nrepresentations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with\nexperimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic\nexperiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer\nmodel grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the\nface of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes\nprone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to\nhallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide\nvariety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate\nactivations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we\nconfirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the\noutput of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept\npatterns embedded in transformer layer activations.

A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral\nimagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while\nhyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior\nhyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix\nfactorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and\nspectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based\nmodel that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while\npreserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes\nfive multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at\nthe same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors\ngrow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To\naddress this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively\nexpands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.\nMoreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and\norders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise\nrelations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework.

One way to achieve this is by leveraging the specific\ncharacteristics of the data at hand. In the case of turbulent flows, fluid\nvelocities can be measured and recorded as multi-component vectors at discrete\npoints in space, using techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) or\ncomputational fluid mechanics (CFD). However, the vectorised nature of the data\nis ignored by standard ML approaches, as widely-used loss functions such as the\nmean-square error treat each component of a velocity vector in isolation.\nTherefore, the aim of this work is to better preserve the physical\ncharacteristics of the data by introducing loss functions that utilise vector\nsimilarity metrics. To this end, vector-based loss functions are developed here\nand implemented alongside a U-Net model for a turbulent flow field inpainting\nproblem, amounting to the prediction of velocity vectors inside large gaps in\nPIV images. The intention is for the inpainting task to pose a significant\nchallenge for the ML models in order to shed light on their capabilities.

Our\nCNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively\nsurpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported\nmachine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on\nthe power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and\ncomplex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed\npressure.

Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on\nbenign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive\nrates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques\nhave demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by\nlearning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In\nparticular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the\ndistance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it\nbetween dissimilar (negative) views.

We perform\nthis by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number\nof distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess\nthe similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use\nthree conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight\ndeep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations\nfrom multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per\ninstance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast\nmajority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak\ncorrelation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate\ncorrelation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing\nthe prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can\nprovide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing\naleatoric uncertainty remains limited."}

In practice, deep networks\noften produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode\noverlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering\ngeneralization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss\nprovide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a\nfailure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly\nquantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices\nderived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics\nagainst a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,\ninterpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.\nWe validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST\nvariants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple\narchitectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low\nrho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction\nerror, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.\nEstimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower\nbounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen\nEstimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)\ncan guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware\nregularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across\nmodels and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool\nfor evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations."}

Persona employs a neural\nadapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time\ndevice data.

The\nprototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,\nfacilitating efficient evolution.
