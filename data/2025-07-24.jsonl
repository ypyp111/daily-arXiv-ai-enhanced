Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold.

However, current methods are often affected by\nmisalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to\ninaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during\ncross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in\nprojection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and\nrolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key\ninsight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at\nobject-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.\nBased on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align\ncross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose\nPrior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct\nlocal misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve\nglobal misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)\nto process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly\nenhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively\nutilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural\nGuidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to\nefficiently fuse aligned depth and image features.

The root cause of this misalignment lies in\nprojection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and\nrolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key\ninsight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at\nobject-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.\nBased on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align\ncross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose\nPrior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct\nlocal misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs.

To enable\nfair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise\nstorage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\\times$\ngreater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy.

This study fills in this theoretical\ngap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization\nproblem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable\nnoise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies\nthe negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a\ncritical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect\ntraining. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware\ntime minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the\ncompression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and\ntraining task. DeCo-SGD achieves up to 5.07 and 1.37 speed-ups over D-SGD and\nstatic strategy in high-latency and low, varying bandwidth networks,\nrespectively."}

Data augmentation is a powerful\nstrategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view\nsequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we\npropose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation\nframework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on\nsingle-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core\nchallenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic\nviews and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low\ncomputational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical\nobjects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of\ninnovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we\nintroduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that\nlearns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.\nSecond, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse\nSpatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views\nand remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the\nviews to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,\nwe incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large\nLanguage Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted\nexpert guidance only when necessary.

In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how\ndifferent forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral\ncompressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,\nrevealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$\nrobustness via their effects on the learned representations.

In this work,\nwe introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD\nrobustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative\nnuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual\nnuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion\nmodels. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that\noutperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with\ngenerative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study\nto evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance\nshifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model\nrankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be\ncaptured when applying common binary shifts.

In this\npaper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a\nnovel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a\nsingle stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative\nmodels (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates\nsparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled\napproximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the\nnumerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using\nboth EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\\ge 1.8\\times$ speedups with\nminimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\\leq 0.10$ and FID $\\leq 4.5$) compared to\nunmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA\nadapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet\nwithout any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\\times$ with $\\sim\n0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS."}

Dataset distillation mitigates this by\ncompressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while\npreserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance\nunder fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations\nfor redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this\nwork, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset\ndistillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes\ndecoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of\nquantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss\nas the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable\nfair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise\nstorage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\\times$\ngreater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across\ndiverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our\napproach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs."}

Fundus-Engine automates localization and\nleverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease\nclassification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis\nwithin a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically\naligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable\nreasoning paths.

To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various\nrobust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric\nlosses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict\nconstraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly\noptimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting\nability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding\nadvanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging\ntheoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust\nloss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.\nHowever, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced\noptimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and\napplicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric\nlosses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario\nand propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We\nrigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE\nsatisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric\npassive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss\nframework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL).

While compressibility and robustness have each been\nstudied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains\nelusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how\ndifferent forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral\ncompressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,\nrevealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$\nrobustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the\nvulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -\nwhether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.\nThrough empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm\nour theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities\npersist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the\nemergence of universal adversarial perturbations.

We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce\ndesirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,\nclass separation, and activation sparsity.
