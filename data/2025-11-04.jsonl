A key focus is on\nmitigating the oscillatory behavior often encountered in traditional spectral\nmethods while retaining high-order accuracy in smooth regions. We present a\nsystematic comparison between CWENO7-based and generalized polynomial chaos\n(gPC)-based approaches. Although gPC methods achieve spectral convergence, they\nare prone to Gibbs-type oscillations in nonsmooth settings. By contrast, CWENO7\nutilizes local stencils to achieve a balance: non-oscillatory behavior near\ndiscontinuities and high-order convergence in smooth regions. To validate the\napproach, we conduct numerical experiments on a range of one- and\ntwo-dimensional smooth and nonsmooth problems, including shallow water\nequations with random inputs. The results demonstrate that CWENO7 interpolation\nprovides accurate estimates of probability density functions, mean values, and\nstandard deviations, particularly in regimes where gPC expansions exhibit\nstrong oscillations.

Experimental evidence indicates that\nthree intrinsic material properties govern fracture nucleation in elastic\nmaterials: elasticity, strength, and fracture toughness. Among these, strength\nremains the most often misunderstood, as it is not a single scalar quantity but\nrather a full surface in stress space. The flexibility in defining this\nstrength envelope in phase-field models poses significant challenges,\nespecially under complex loading conditions. Existing models in the literature\noften fail to capture both the qualitative shape and the quantitative fit of\nexperimentally observed strength surfaces. To address this limitation, recent\nwork introduces a new energy functional within a cohesive phase-field\nframework, specifically designed to control the shape of elastic domains. This\nmodel introduces an internal variable to describe the inelastic response.\nNotably, the strength is decoupled from the internal length, that is not\ninterpreted as a material length scale, as often done in literature, but rather\nas a purely variational tool. The proposed functional allows for a rigorous\nvariational framework, enabling the use of tools from the calculus of\nvariations. We investigate the Gamma-convergence of the model to a sharp\ncohesive fracture energy in the one- and two-dimensional (anti-plane) setting,\nusing a finite element discrete formulation and exploiting the strong\nlocalization of the damage variable.

While recent unlearning techniques can effectively\nremove undesirable content without severely compromising performance on\nstandard benchmarks, we find that they may inadvertently create ``knowledge\nholes'' -- unintended losses of benign knowledge that standard benchmarks fail\nto capture. To probe where unlearned models reveal knowledge holes, we propose\na test case generation framework that explores both immediate neighbors of\nunlearned content and broader areas of potential failures. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates significant hidden costs of unlearning: up to 98.7\\% of the test\ncases yield irrelevant or nonsensical responses from unlearned models, despite\nbeing answerable by the pretrained model.

Although\nvarious modelling approaches exist, a direct comparison that jointly evaluates\naccuracy and computational efficiency is missing. Furthermore, studies on the\ncomputational modelling of highly viscous lubricants such as grease in\ngearboxes are limited. This study addresses these gaps by comparing two\nmesh-based Eulerian solvers (OpenFOAM and Ansys-Fluent) and two Lagrangian\nparticle-based solvers (PreonLab and MESHFREE) for oil distribution in\ngearboxes. Two benchmark cases are considered: one for qualitative assessment\nand another for quantitative evaluation. OpenFOAM and Ansys-Fluent show good\nagreement with the experiment data in selected cases, but incur a significant\ncomputational cost. PreonLab performs well qualitatively, yet exhibits greater\ndeviation in quantitative predictions.

However, their\napplication to large-scale engineering tasks suffers from significant\ncomputational overhead. And the fact that current models impose a uniform\ncomputational cost while physical fields exhibit vastly different complexities\nconstitutes a fundamental mismatch, which is the root of this inefficiency. For\ninstance, in turbulence flows, intricate vortex regions require deeper network\nprocessing compared to stable flows. To address this, we introduce a framework:\nSkip-Block Routing (SBR), a general framework designed for Transformer-based\nneural operators, capable of being integrated into their multi-layer\narchitectures. First, SBR uses a routing mechanism to learn the complexity and\nranking of tokens, which is then applied during inference.

During the pandemic, we have observed a spike in\ncases related to mental health, such as anxiety, stress, and depression.\nDepression significantly influences most diseases worldwide, making it\ndifficult to detect mental health conditions in people due to unawareness and\nunwillingness to consult a doctor. However, nowadays, people extensively use\nonline social media platforms to express their emotions and thoughts. Hence,\nsocial media platforms are now becoming a large data source that can be\nutilized for detecting depression and mental illness. However, existing\napproaches often overlook data sparsity in tweets and the multimodal aspects of\nsocial media. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework that\ncombines textual, user-specific, and image analysis to detect depression among\nsocial media users. To provide enough context about the user's emotional state,\nwe propose (i) an extrinsic feature by harnessing the URLs present in tweets\nand (ii) extracting textual content present in images posted in tweets. We also\nextract five sets of features belonging to different modalities to describe a\nuser. Additionally, we introduce a Deep Learning model, the Visual Neural\nNetwork (VNN), to generate embeddings of user-posted images, which are used to\ncreate the visual feature vector for prediction. We contribute a curated\nCovid-19 dataset of depressed and non-depressed users for research purposes and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our model in detecting depression during the\nCovid-19 outbreak. Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods over\na benchmark dataset by 2%-8% and produces promising results on the Covid-19\ndataset. Our analysis highlights the impact of each modality and provides\nvaluable insights into users' mental and emotional states."}

For BO, we benchmarked the\nfoundational BoTorch Ax implementation against the state-of-the-art q-Expected\nHypervolume Improvement (qEHVI, BoTorchM). The generative approach involved\nfine-tuning models via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), framing the\nchallenge as a regression problem with a custom output head. Our results show\nthat BoTorch qEHVI achieved perfect convergence (GD=0.0), setting the\nperformance ceiling. Crucially, the best-performing LLM (WizardMath-7B)\nachieved a Generational Distance (GD) of 1.21, significantly outperforming the\ntraditional BoTorch Ax baseline (GD=15.03). We conclude that specialized BO\nframeworks remain the performance leader for guaranteed convergence, but\nfine-tuned LLMs are validated as a promising, computationally fast alternative,\ncontributing essential comparative metrics to the field of AI-driven\noptimization. The findings have direct industrial applications in optimizing\nformulation design for resins, polymers, and paints, where multi-objective\ntrade-offs between mechanical, rheological, and chemical properties are\ncritical to innovation and production efficiency."}

Conventional missing-modality recovery approaches, which\ndepend on training with complete multimodal data, often suffer from semantic\ndistortion under extreme data distributions, such as fixed-modality absence. To\naddress this, we propose the Federated Dialogue-guided and Semantic-Consistent\nDiffusion (FedDISC) framework, pioneering the integration of federated learning\ninto missing-modality recovery. By federated aggregation of modality-specific\ndiffusion models trained on clients and broadcasting them to clients missing\ncorresponding modalities, FedDISC overcomes single-client reliance on modality\ncompleteness. Additionally, the DISC-Diffusion module ensures consistency in\ncontext, speaker identity, and semantics between recovered and available\nmodalities, using a Dialogue Graph Network to capture conversational\ndependencies and a Semantic Conditioning Network to enforce semantic alignment.\nWe further introduce a novel Alternating Frozen Aggregation strategy, which\ncyclically freezes recovery and classifier modules to facilitate collaborative\noptimization.

In practice, however, previously unseen or unknown fault types\n(i.e., out-of-distribution or open-set observations not present during\ntraining) can occur, causing such methods to fail and posing a significant\nchallenge to their widespread industrial deployment. To address this challenge,\nthis paper proposes a semi-supervised open-set fault diagnosis (SOFD) framework\nthat enhances and extends the applicability of deep learning models in open-set\nfault diagnosis scenarios. The framework includes a reliability subset\nconstruction process, which uses a multi-layer fusion feature representation\nextracted by a supervised feature learning model to select an unlabeled test\nsubset. The labeled training set and pseudo-labeled test subset are then fed\ninto a semi-supervised diagnosis model to learn discriminative features for\neach class, enabling accurate classification of known faults and effective\ndetection of unknown samples.

A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own\ntrade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length,\nwhile Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes.

Despite advancements in algorithm design, existing\napproaches suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient learning of\nnoise-contaminated unimodal data, leading to corrupted cross-modal\ninteractions, and inadequate fusion of multimodal representations, resulting in\ndiscarding discriminative unimodal information while retaining multimodal\nredundant information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nDouble Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified\ncompact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank\nRenyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse\nnoise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as\ncompared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods. The DIB comprises\ntwo key modules: 1) learning a sufficient and compressed representation of\nindividual unimodal data by maximizing the task-relevant information and\ndiscarding the superfluous information, and 2) ensuring the discriminative\nability of multimodal representation through a novel attention bottleneck\nfusion mechanism. Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that\neffectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing\ninter-modal complementarity. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nCH-SIMS, and MVSA-Single validate the effectiveness of our method.

To\nexplore creative human-AI interaction exemplified by dance, we build an\ninteractive model based on motion capture (MoCap) data.

For\ninstance, in turbulence flows, intricate vortex regions require deeper network\nprocessing compared to stable flows. To address this, we introduce a framework:\nSkip-Block Routing (SBR), a general framework designed for Transformer-based\nneural operators, capable of being integrated into their multi-layer\narchitectures.

This paper investigates\nthe impact of the diversity of sources of synthetic data on fine-tuned large\nlanguage models. We focus on three key dimensions: distribution collapse,\nadversarial robustness, and self-preference bias. Our findings reveal that\nfine-tuning models on synthetic data from diverse sources can mitigate\ndistribution collapse, preserving the breadth of the output distribution and\nthe diversity of the output text. Furthermore, while both human and synthetic\nfine-tuning data can remove safeguards, the latter preserves higher output\nquality, thus making outputs potentially more usable and dangerous. Finally,\nfine-tuning reduces self-preference bias, with human data being the most\neffective, followed by multi-source synthetic data."}

Our\nkey idea is to represent an unseen target domain as a combination of latent\ndomains automatically discovered from training data, enabling the model to\nadaptively transfer knowledge across domains. To realize this, we perform\nlatent domain clustering on image features and fuse domain-specific text\nfeatures based on the similarity between the input image and each latent\ndomain. Experiments on four benchmarks show that this strategy yields\nconsistent gains over VLM-based baselines and provides new insights into\nimproving robustness under domain shift."}

In this work we assess the degree to which\nSparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can reveal (and control) associations the model has\nmade between race and stigmatizing concepts. We first identify SAE latents in\nGemma-2 models which appear to correlate with Black individuals. We find that\nthis latent activates on reasonable input sequences (e.g., \"African American\")\nbut also problematic words like \"incarceration\". We then show that we can use\nthis latent to steer models to generate outputs about Black patients, and\nfurther that this can induce problematic associations in model outputs as a\nresult. For example, activating the Black latent increases the risk assigned to\nthe probability that a patient will become \"belligerent\". We evaluate the\ndegree to which such steering via latents might be useful for mitigating bias.\nWe find that this offers improvements in simple settings, but is less\nsuccessful for more realistic and complex clinical tasks.

When the underlying graph structure varies, even the state-of-the-art\nRL methods require recomputation or at least fine-tuning, which can be\ntime-consuming and impair real-time applicability. This paper proposes an\nEquilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) framework to effectively learn a\ngeneralized policy with robust cross-graph zero-shot performance. In the\ncontext of PEGs, our framework is generally applicable to both pursuer and\nevader sides in both no-exit and multi-exit scenarios. These two\ngeneralizability properties, to our knowledge, are the first to appear in this\ndomain. The core idea of the EPG framework is to train an RL policy across\ndifferent graph structures against the equilibrium policy for each single\ngraph. To construct an equilibrium oracle for single-graph policies, we present\na dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that provably generates pure-strategy Nash\nequilibrium with near-optimal time complexity. To guarantee scalability with\nrespect to pursuer number, we further extend DP and RL by designing a grouping\nmechanism and a sequence model for joint policy decomposition, respectively.\nExperimental results show that, using equilibrium guidance and a distance\nfeature proposed for cross-graph PEG training, the EPG framework guarantees\ndesirable zero-shot performance in various unseen real-world graphs. Besides,\nwhen trained under an equilibrium heuristic proposed for the graphs with exits,\nour generalized pursuer policy can even match the performance of the fine-tuned\npolicies from the state-of-the-art PEG methods."}

We recognize the benefits of recent works on logic and Look Up Table\n(LUT) based networks, such as LogicNets, NeuraLUT, DWN, among others, in\noffering models that simultaneously reduce both the memory and compute\nfootprints. However, these models natively do not perform well on common vision\ntasks, such as CIFAR-10/100. In this work, we propose LL-ViT, a novel edge\noptimized vision transformer design that integrates layers of LUT neurons\nwithin the transformer architecture. Based on our characterization that reveals\nthat a majority of model weights and computations are from the channel mixer\n(MLP layer), we design an alternate LUT-based channel mixer, and simultaneously\ndevelop an FPGA-based accelerator for LL-ViT.

PCP leverages class-level concept priors as\nweak supervision and incorporates a refinement mechanism with KL divergence and\nentropy regularization to align predictions with clinical reasoning.\nExperiments on PH2 (dermoscopy) and WBCatt (hematology) show that PCP improves\nconcept-level F1-score by over 33% compared to zero-shot baselines, while\ndelivering competitive classification performance on four medical datasets\n(PH2, WBCatt, HAM10000, and CXR4) relative to fully supervised concept\nbottleneck models (CBMs) and V-IP."}

We evaluate 11 state-of-the-art\ndetectors, revealing critical asymmetry: detectors successfully identify the\nplagiarism evasion problem but fail for the case of authorship obfuscation. Our\nfindings demonstrate that current detection approaches cannot effectively\nhandle the intermediate laundering region, necessitating fundamental advances\nin detection architectures beyond existing semantic and stylistic\ndiscrimination methods.

CMI-MTL comprises three key modules: fine-grained visual-text feature\nalignment (FVTA), cross-modal interleaved feature representation (CIFR), and\nfree-form answer-enhanced multi-task learning (FFAE). FVTA extracts the most\nrelevant regions in image-text pairs through fine-grained visual-text feature\nalignment. CIFR captures cross-modal sequential interactions via cross-modal\ninterleaved feature representation. FFAE leverages auxiliary knowledge from\nopen-ended questions through free-form answer-enhanced multi-task learning,\nimproving the model's capability for open-ended Med-VQA. Experimental results\nshow that CMI-MTL outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on three\nMed-VQA datasets: VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and OVQA. Furthermore, we conduct more\ninterpretability experiments to prove the effectiveness. The code is publicly\navailable at https://github.com/BioMedIA-repo/CMI-MTL."}

Together, these steps produce a compact set of\nenergy-sensitive indicators with both statistical robustness and physical\nsignificance, resulting in impact energy predictions that remain interpretable\nand traceable to measurable structural responses. Using this optimised input\nspace, a fully-connected neural network is trained and validated with\nexperimental data from multiple impact scenarios, including pristine and\ndamaged states.

This paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation of\nfairness-based client selection algorithms such as RBFF and RBCSF against\nrandom and greedy client selection regarding fairness, model performance, and\ntime, in three benchmarking datasets (CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and EMNIST). This\nwork aims to shed light on the fairness-performance and fairness-speed\ntrade-offs in a volatile edge environment and explore potential future research\nopportunities to address existing pitfalls in \\textit{fair client selection}\nstrategies in FL. Our results indicate that more equitable client selection\nalgorithms, while providing a marginally better opportunity among clients, can\nresult in slower global training in volatile environments\\footnote{The code for\nour experiments can be found at\nhttps://github.com/obaidullahzaland/FairFL_FLTA."}

While large datasets can usually be collected at relatively low cost\nin domains such as language or vision, scientific machine learning is often\nlimited by the high expense of generating training data through numerical\nsimulations. However, by adjusting modeling assumptions and approximations,\nsimulation fidelity can be traded for computational cost, an aspect absent in\nother domains. We investigate this trade-off between data fidelity and cost in\nneural surrogates using low- and high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes\n(RANS) simulations. Reformulating classical scaling laws, we decompose the\ndataset axis into compute budget and dataset composition. Our experiments\nreveal compute-performance scaling behavior and exhibit budget-dependent\noptimal fidelity mixes for the given dataset configuration.

In this study, we explore region-aware\nreconstruction strategies for a foundation model in resting-state fMRI, moving\nbeyond approaches that rely on random region masking. Specifically, we\nintroduce an ROI-guided masking strategy using the Automated Anatomical\nLabelling Atlas (AAL3), applied directly to full 4D fMRI volumes to selectively\nmask semantically coherent brain regions during self-supervised pretraining.\nUsing the ADHD-200 dataset comprising 973 subjects with resting-state fMRI\nscans, we show that our method achieves a 4.23% improvement in classification\naccuracy for distinguishing healthy controls from individuals diagnosed with\nADHD, compared to conventional random masking. Region-level attribution\nanalysis reveals that brain volumes within the limbic region and cerebellum\ncontribute most significantly to reconstruction fidelity and model\nrepresentation. Our results demonstrate that masking anatomical regions during\nmodel pretraining not only enhances interpretability but also yields more\nrobust and discriminative representations. In future work, we plan to extend\nthis approach by evaluating it on additional neuroimaging datasets, and\ndeveloping new loss functions explicitly derived from region-aware\nreconstruction objectives.

To address this, we propose an\ninteractive agent that produces explanations through an auditable sequence of\nactions. The agent learns a policy to strategically seek external visual\nevidence to support its diagnostic reasoning. This policy is optimized using\nreinforcement learning, resulting in a model that is both efficient and\ngeneralizable. Our experiments show that this action-based reasoning process\nsignificantly improves calibrated accuracy, reducing the Brier score by 18\\%\ncompared to a non-interactive baseline. To validate the faithfulness of the\nagent's explanations, we introduce a causal intervention method. By masking the\nvisual evidence the agent chooses to use, we observe a measurable degradation\nin its performance ($\\Delta$Brier=+0.029), confirming that the evidence is\nintegral to its decision-making process.

In this paper, we tailor one Parallel Decoupling Framework (PDF)\nfor multimodal embedding learning, by utilizing the proprietary steerability of\nMLLMs, i.e., their ability to flexibly generate quite differentiated response\nunder explicit instructions. Concretely, PDF conditions a shared MLLM backbone\non distinct, learnable prefixes to roll out multiple parallel paths for one\ninput, then relies on these paths to obtain parallel embeddings. To promote\nfull parallel diversity, we employ Mutual Information Minimization (MIM) as an\nexplicit constraint, coupled with per-path contrastive supervision to maintain\nsemantic alignment.

In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance.

On the basis of the SurgVeo benchmark, we task the\nadvanced Veo-3 model with a zero-shot prediction task on surgical clips from\nlaparoscopic and neurosurgical procedures. A panel of four board-certified\nsurgeons evaluates the generated videos according to the SPP. Our results\nreveal a distinct \"plausibility gap\": while Veo-3 achieves exceptional Visual\nPerceptual Plausibility, it fails critically at higher levels of the SPP,\nincluding Instrument Operation Plausibility, Environment Feedback Plausibility,\nand Surgical Intent Plausibility. This work provides the first quantitative\nevidence of the chasm between visually convincing mimicry and causal\nunderstanding in surgical AI.

Yet, little is\nknown about how these decisions are made, whether they are efficient, or how to\nimprove them. We study these decisions in the context of high-volume outbound\nsales where leads are ample, but time is scarce and failure is common. We\nformalize the dynamic screening decision as an optimal stopping problem and\ndevelop a generative language model-based sequential decision agent - a\nstopping agent - that learns whether and when to quit conversations by\nimitating a retrospectively-inferred optimal stopping policy. Our approach\nhandles high-dimensional textual states, scales to large language models, and\nworks with both open-source and proprietary language models. When applied to\ncalls from a large European telecommunications firm, our stopping agent reduces\nthe time spent on failed calls by 54% while preserving nearly all sales;\nreallocating the time saved increases expected sales by up to 37%. Upon\nexamining the linguistic cues that drive salespeople's quitting decisions, we\nfind that they tend to overweight a few salient expressions of consumer\ndisinterest and mispredict call failure risk, suggesting cognitive bounds on\ntheir ability to make real-time conversational decisions.

Standard approaches such as\nmajority voting often collapse to spurious yet popular answers. We introduce\nSelf-Harmony, a framework built on a simple intuition: the correct answer\nshould remain stable across both an original question and its paraphrase.\nSelf-Harmony operationalizes this by employing a single model in two\ncomplementary roles: a Solver to produce answers and a Reframer to rephrase the\ninput. Based on this, we further propose a pseudo-label method: instead of\nmajority voting, it aggregates answer frequencies across these original and\nreframed views using the harmonic mean. This is a process that naturally\nselects for solutions stable under reframing, thereby avoiding the common trap\nof favoring view-dependent, spurious answers. Crucially, this requires no human\nsupervision or auxiliary models.

Our approach begins by augmenting a\ntext-to-video model with motion control, which generates high-quality videos\nthat adhere to the global text prompt and local motion guidance, but does not\nperform inference on the fly. As such, we distill this bidirectional teacher\ninto a causal student through Self Forcing with Distribution Matching\nDistillation, enabling real-time streaming inference. Several key challenges\narise when generating videos of long, potentially infinite time-horizons: (1)\nbridging the domain gap from training on finite length and extrapolating to\ninfinite horizons, (2) sustaining high quality by preventing error\naccumulation, and (3) maintaining fast inference, without incurring growth in\ncomputational cost due to increasing context windows. A key to our approach is\nintroducing carefully designed sliding-window causal attention, combined with\nattention sinks.

Prior work has largely examined only single-step generation,\ntypically the final answer, and has modelled PK and CK interaction only as a\nbinary choice in a rank-1 subspace.

We propose a novel rank-2\nprojection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately\nand use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across\nlonger NLE sequences. Experiments on four QA datasets and three open-weight\ninstruction-tuned LLMs show that diverse knowledge interactions are poorly\nrepresented in a rank-1 subspace but are effectively captured in our rank-2\nformulation.
