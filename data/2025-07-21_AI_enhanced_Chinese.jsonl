We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies\nand find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step\nbefore the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's\noriginal performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on\nscene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning\naccuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune\nmodels using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and\nevaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates\nsuperior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,\nwe find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade\nperformance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from \"closer to\" to \"farther\nfrom\"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable\nperformance under such shifts.

Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with\nClaude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic\ncoherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid\nsolution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of\nsymbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications\nin sensitive domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684Prolog\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06LLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aProlog\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u6df7\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760AI\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although such\nsystems usually have turbulent flows and the bubbles are typically much larger\nthan the particles, there currently exist no predictive models for this case\nwhich consistently include finite-size effects in the interaction with the\nbubbles as well as inertial effects for the particles simultaneously. As a\nfirst step, Jiang and Krug (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 1006, 2025, A19) proposed a\nfrozen turbulence approach which captures the collision rate between\nfinite-size bubbles and inertial particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence\nusing the bubble slip velocity probability density function measured from\nsimulations as an input. In this study, we further develop this approach into a\nmodel where the bubble-particle collision rate can be predicted a priori based\non the bubble, particle, and turbulence properties. By comparing the predicted\ncollision rate with simulations of bubbles with Stokes numbers of 2.8 and 6.3,\nand particles with Stokes numbers ranging from 0.01 to 2 in turbulence with a\nTaylor Reynolds number of 64, good agreement is found between model and\nsimulations for Froude number $Fr \\leq 0.25$. Beyond this range of bubble\nStokes number, we propose a criterion for using our model and discuss the\nmodel's validity. Evaluating our model at typical flotation parameters\nindicates that particle inertia effects are usually important. Generally,\nsmaller bubbles, larger particles, and stronger turbulence increase the overall\ncollision rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6c14\u6ce1-\u9897\u7c92\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c14\u6ce1\u3001\u9897\u7c92\u548c\u6e4d\u6d41\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u6ce1\u6cab\u6d6e\u9009\uff09\u7684\u6c14\u6ce1-\u9897\u7c92\u78b0\u649e\u5efa\u6a21\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u9897\u7c92\u60ef\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u6e4d\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c14\u6ce1\u6ed1\u79fb\u901f\u5ea6\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08Fr \u2264 0.25\uff09\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5224\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7c92\u5b50\u60ef\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u901a\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u6c14\u6ce1\u3001\u8f83\u5927\u9897\u7c92\u548c\u8f83\u5f3a\u6e4d\u6d41\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u3002"}}

Contact lens mechanical interactions with the\nocular surface have been found to affect the ocular surface. The mechanical\ninteractions between the contact lens and the eye are difficult to measure and\ncalculate in the clinical setting, and the research in this field is limited.\nThis paper presents the first mathematical model that couples the interaction\nbetween the contact lens and the open eye, where the contact lens\nconfiguration, the contact lens suction pressure, and the deformed ocular shape\nare all emergent properties of the model. The non-linear coupling between the\ncontact lens and the eye is achieved assuming the the suction pressure under\nthe lens is applied directly to the ocular surface, neglecting the post-lens\ntear film layer. The contact lens dynamics is modeled using a previous\npublished model. We consider a homogeneous and a heterogeneous linear elastic\neye model, different ocular shapes, different lens shapes and lens thickness\nprofiles, and extract lens deformation, lens suction pressure profiles, and\nocular deformations and stresses for all the scenarios considered. The model\npredicts higher ocular deformations and stresses at the center of the eye and\nin the limbal/scleral region. Accounting for a heterogeneous material eye\nparameters increases such deformations and stresses. The ocular displacements\nand stresses increase non-linearly as we increase the stiffness of the contact\nlens. Inserting a steeper contact lens on the eye results in a reduction of the\nocular displacement at the center of the eye and a larger displacement at the\nedge of the contact lens.

Among numerous approaches\nto overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language\nmodels has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,\ndomain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In\nthis paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to\nimprove language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the\nlatent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual\ninformation is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph\nEmbedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to\nalign entity and text embeddings.

In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate\nLLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such\nas academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this\npossibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.\nBased on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack\n(\\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either\nattack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial\nprompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial\npayloads within predefined subsections.

However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice\nQuestion (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there\nis no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is\nunclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and\nreflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate\nthe robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely\nused probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that\nall methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations.

Supplementary material: 8 pages, 7 figures.\n  Accepted at ACM Multimedia 2025", "summary": "Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,\nparticularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic\nunderstanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and\ntraffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as\nYOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales\nwhile balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework\ndesigned to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving\ndetection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:\nFrequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which\nrefines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency\nfiltering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive\nHierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively\nintegrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen\nhierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,\nand Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation\ncapabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while\nreducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and\nintegration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that\nachieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational\nefficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios.

Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are\nresource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of\nlinguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The\nuse of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought\nto reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the\nutility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity\nrequires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries\n(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream\nnarratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside\nestablished coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to\npredict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone\nrobustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only\nmodels, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to\n\\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best\n\\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models).

EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and\nGLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing\nneed for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that\ncapture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.\n  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic\nparameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound\nviews. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on\nKoopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical\nmetadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic\nsequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via\nattention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,\nresulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).\n  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac\npathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the\ncurve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five\nfolds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and\nspecificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data.

Our study highlights the\nfeasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted\nknowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology\nmatching at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "KROMA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684Ontology Matching\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u548cRAG\u52a8\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709OM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0cKROMA\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u548cRAG\uff0c\u5f15\u5165bisimilarity\u6982\u5ff5\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u672c\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfOM\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "KROMA\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21OM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

As conversation\nhistories become longer, existing large language models face increasing\ncomputational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide\nefficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either\ncompress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on\nfixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and\nunpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,\nwe present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework\nfor large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two\nmain innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the\nprefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the\nattention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value\ncompression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient\ncache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new\nbenchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query\npositions and conversational dependencies.

Existing construction\nmethods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual\nintervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,\nthey struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces\nsuitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce\nAortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces\ndirectly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided\nconditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines\nconditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then\nautomatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,\nensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are\nfitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh\nrepresentation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,\nincluding an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,\nand the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric\nfidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively\neven with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and\npathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or\ncoarctation.

We address this gap\nthrough a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs.

In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge.

Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between\nbenign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this\nability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three\nfactors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that\neven a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model\ntoward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework\nthat utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which\nsubstantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.\nFinally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,\ncan be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring\nthe subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5f53\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5f53\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u5c42\u8df3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u90fd\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u89e6\u53d1\u8d8a\u72f1\uff0c\u4e14\u5c11\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u5373\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5f53\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "VLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u770b\u4f3c\u65e0\u5bb3\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5982\u8868\u60c5\u5305\uff09\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific\narticles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct\napproaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient\nparagraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking\nthese questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and\nsubsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content\nof the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires\ncomparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach\nleverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by\nfine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles\nand using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction\nmethod to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as\nthe centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure\nassesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article\ncompared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs\nusing both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)\nthrough a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions\nand answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively\ncaptures the main ideas discussed in the articles.

Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an\nuncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error\ncovariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry\nprocess. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose\na novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)\nper-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such\nas matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,\nour method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the\nMVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering\nto error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a\nrobust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes.

However, its impact on generalization under\nsubstantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely\nunexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different\nadversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and\nadversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model\narchitectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an\ninherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach\nis evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial\ntraining strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the\nclassification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks\ndesigned to maximize embedding dissimilarity.

Unfortunately, dominant approaches\nrely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to\nsharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur\npatterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based\nframework, dubbed \\ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying\ntexture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \\ours performs DM to generate\nthe prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To\nimplement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a\nmemory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for\nDM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the\nTexture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel\nFilter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes\nspatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering.

However, their top-down training\napproach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed\nfor deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires\nexpertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.\nA knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain\nprimitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode\nhigher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes\ntasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them\nfor reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded\ncurriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly\napplicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.\nUsing a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking\ntraces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model\non this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical\nsuperintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify\nreasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that\nQwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on\nICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired\nprimitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.\nFinally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3\ntransfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance.

However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon.", "AI": {"tldr": "EPSilon\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u54083D\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u5c04\u7ebf\u7701\u7565\uff08ERO\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u533a\u95f4\u7701\u7565\uff08EIO\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eNeRF\u548cSMPL\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u53d8\u5f62\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0cEPSilon\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "EPSilon\u91c7\u7528ERO\u548cEIO\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7701\u7565\u7a7a\u5c04\u7ebf\u548c\u7a7a\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "EPSilon\u4ec5\u97003.9%\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620\u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53474\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EPSilon\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f63D\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Image restoration\nhas emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed\nin the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made\nremarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity\nposes significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in\nreal-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to\nsimplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or\nstate space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network\narchitecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration\nitself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative\npipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image\nrestoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient\nrestoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).\nSpecifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block\nlevel, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to\nachieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the\nintra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative\nto self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity\nwhile preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks\nsuch as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion\ndeblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light\nenhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art\nmethods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with\nsignificantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPW-FNet\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u6ce2\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "PW-FNet\u91c7\u7528\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u5c0f\u6ce2\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5757\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPW-FNet\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "PW-FNet\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

Accepted\n  by ITSC2025", "summary": "Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often\noperate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and\ndeployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity\nposes significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To\naddress these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for\ncooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras\n(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that\nadaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial\nattention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality\nfeature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an\nadaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance\ncomputational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across\ndifferent configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy\nthat dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments\non the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%\n3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D\nbaseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC\nscenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine\nheterogeneous sensor configurations.

Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them.

Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have\nacquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging\nconsistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -\nsuch as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate\nthese biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or\noverlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a\nsite-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across\ndiverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a\nsimulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this\nframework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected\nautoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a\ntop-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight\nprediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior\npreservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as\nreflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although\nthe LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly\nmodeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world\nmulti-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable.

Furthermore, we introduce the\nParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter\nmechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.\nOur architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer\nparameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly\noutperforms existing methods.

Existing\napproaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video\nframes, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to\ninconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free\nEncapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both\nvisual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach\nutilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video\nframes by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing\nthem with noising and denoising steps.

Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating\nconcurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to\nmodulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native\nmultitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam\nintroduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.\nInspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently\nenhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we\npropose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that\napproximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of\nknowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We\nevaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of\nthe MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that\nuncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.\nFinally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic\nfunctions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing\nstability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95f4\u9699\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u638c\u63e1\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5bf9\u5df2\u638c\u63e1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u9694\u79bb\u5176\u4ed6\u9057\u5fd8\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u5927\u8111\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e24\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u548cCIFAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95f4\u9699\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, it often struggles to handle\nscenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and\ntranslation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of\ncamera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and\n3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that\nachieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose\nco-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives.

We\npropose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and\na lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,\nreplay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of\nfrozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers\nwith prototypes derived from their embeddings.

Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in\nSSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to\nlarge codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to\naccount for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on\nnested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features\ninto increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,\nenabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional\nbiases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic\ncontent. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions\nestablish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and\nopen a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for\nthe broader AI community.
