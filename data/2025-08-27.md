*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了水下3D物体检测的无训练方法，比较了两种方案：基于合成数据的深度学习和基于模板匹配的方法，发现模板匹配在真实数据上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下3D物体检测面临训练数据稀缺和标注成本高的挑战，需要找到不依赖真实训练数据的可靠方法。

Method: 开发了两种方法：1）物理基础的声纳模拟管道生成合成数据训练神经网络；2）模型基础的模板匹配系统，利用目标物体的几何先验知识。

Result: 在波罗的海实际测量数据上，神经网络在合成数据上达到98% mAP，但在真实数据上下降到40% mAP；而模板匹配方法在真实数据上保持83% mAP，且不需要训练。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了深度学习在水下领域需要大量数据的传统观念，证明了无训练方法在数据稀缺环境中的优勃性，为自主水下车辆导航等应用开启了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

### [2] [MobileDenseAttn:A Dual-Stream Architecture for Accurate and Interpretable Brain Tumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18294)
*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileDenseAttn是一个融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流模型，用于脑肿瘤MRI检测，在6020个MRI扫描数据集上达到98.35%的测试准确率，比基线模型准确率提升3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%，并通过GradCAM提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑肿瘤MRI检测方法存在泛化能力有限、计算效率低、缺乏可解释性和透明度等问题，限制了临床应用的可靠性。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn模型，融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流架构，采用特征级融合，在增强的6020个MRI扫描数据集上进行训练，使用5折交叉验证协议。

Result: 模型训练准确率99.75%，测试准确率98.35%，F1分数0.9835（95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920），比VGG19准确率提升3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热图清晰显示肿瘤区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一个高效、高性能、可解释的模型，有很高概率成为临床实践中识别脑肿瘤的实用工具。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在视觉实体引用时的知识回忆能力显著低于文本引用，存在系统性的多模态基础缺陷，可通过内部状态探针检测不可靠响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础中的系统性缺陷，特别是当实体引用从文本变为视觉时，模型回忆事实知识能力显著下降的问题。

Method: 通过控制研究分析VLMs在不同引用方式下的表现差异，利用模型内部状态模式构建探针来检测不可靠响应，并在视觉问答任务中验证选择性预测效果。

Result: 视觉引用使VLMs回忆事实知识的能力减半；内部状态探针检测不可靠响应的准确率超过92%；在视觉问答任务中，探针使覆盖率提高7.87%，错误风险降低0.9%。

Conclusion: VLMs存在可检测的系统性多模态基础缺陷，内部状态探针能有效识别不可靠响应，为语言基础研究提供了重要方向和实用工具。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

### [4] [SERES: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction from sparse views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18314)
*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义感知的神经重建方法，从稀疏图像生成高保真3D模型，通过添加基于patch的语义logits来丰富神经隐式表示，并引入基于几何基元掩码的正则化来缓解形状模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏输入中特征不匹配导致的严重辐射模糊问题，提高从稀疏图像进行3D重建的质量和准确性。

Method: 在神经隐式表示中添加基于patch的语义logits，与有符号距离场和辐射场联合优化；引入基于几何基元掩码的新型正则化方法来缓解形状模糊。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，相比SparseNeuS重建的倒角距离平均减少44%，相比VolRecon减少20%；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo等密集重建基线的插件时，DTU数据集上的平均误差分别减少69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏图像3D重建中的辐射模糊和形状模糊问题，显著提高了重建精度，可作为插件提升现有密集重建方法的性能。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [Automated Landfill Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study of Lightweight and Custom Architectures with the AerialWaste Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18315)
*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用轻量级深度学习模型和集成方法，在AerialWaste数据集上实现了92.33%的非法垃圾填埋场检测准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球构成严重威胁，但人工识别困难且缺乏高质量公开数据集。深度学习可以高效识别这些填埋场，节省时间和资源

Method: 使用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等轻量级深度学习模型，避免过拟合问题，并采用集成融合技术结合最佳模型

Result: 集成模型实现了92.33%准确率、92.67%精确率、92.33%灵敏度、92.41% F1分数和92.71%特异性的优异性能

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成技术能有效解决非法垃圾填埋场检测问题，在AerialWaste数据集上取得了显著成果，为环境保护提供了可行的技术方案

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU是一个多模态情感分析框架，通过结构-语义统一方法整合模态特定结构信息和跨模态语义对齐，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视了模态特定结构依赖和语义错位问题，限制了模型的质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: 提出结构-语义统一器(SSU)：1)动态构建模态特定图(文本用语法结构，音视频用轻量级文本引导注意力机制)；2)引入基于全局文本语义的语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心；3)采用多视图对比学习目标

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销，定性分析验证了其可解释性和捕捉细微情感模式的能力

Conclusion: SSU通过系统整合结构信息和语义对齐，有效解决了多模态情感分析中的关键挑战，在性能、效率和可解释性方面均有显著提升

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的快速单图像人脸重建框架，能够在10毫秒内从任意姿态的单张人脸图像生成高质量的3D模型，比优化方法快1000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅人脸重建方法要么需要逐人优化（速度慢），要么前馈方法重建质量不足。需要开发一个既能保持高质量重建又能实现实时推理的框架。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器神经网络设计：1）从多视角人脸数据构建3DGS模板模型；2）编码输入图像为身份特定、姿态不变的潜在嵌入；3）解码预测模板高斯参数残差，实现快速前馈推理。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），运行速度比逐优化方法（如FlashAvatar）快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过创新的潜在空间设计和残差预测机制，实现了高质量和极速的3D人脸重建，扩展了3D高斯泼溅在消费级和交互式系统中的逼真虚拟人应用范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

*Giuseppe Stragapede,Sam Merrick,Vedrana Krivokuća Hahn,Justin Sukaitis,Vincent Graf Narbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于人道主义紧急场景的移动生物识别系统，采用PolyProtect生物特征模板保护方案，在人脸和指纹识别中验证了其有效性、安全性和隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急人道主义场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但会给处于脆弱环境的数据主体带来风险，需要开发适合这些场景的生物特征模板保护方案。

Method: 通过制定功能、操作和安全隐私需求，比较分析现有BTP方案，选择PolyProtect方法处理神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器和真实人道主义数据集进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性方面表现良好，且首次在指纹生物识别中得到验证，证明了其模态独立性。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种有效、模块化且计算轻量的BTP方案，适用于人道主义紧急场景，未来计划发布代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉基础模型在关系理解方面存在限制，提出通过动态关系图增强模型的方法，在多个领域实验中显示了收益


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型虽然在表征学习方面表现优异，但在需要明确关系理解的任务上存在限制，特别是在实体、角色和空间-时间关系的理解方面

Method: 提出在基础模型中集成明确的关系接口，具体实现为动态关系图（图的拓扑结构和边语义根据输入和任务上下文推断），通过轻量级、上下文适配的图理解模块增强基础模型

Result: 在人类操作动作识别和脑红细胞分割等领域的实验表明，增强后的模型在细粒度语义保真性、外部分布稳健性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升，同时具有良好的内存和硬件效率

Conclusion: 提出了一个针对基础模型图混合体的研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构建、多层次关系理解、跨模态融合以及直接探测结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

*Lucas Wojcik,Gabriel E. Lima,Valfride Nascimento,Eduil Nascimento Jr.,Rayson Laroca,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的车牌可读性分类数据集(LPLC)，包含10,210张车辆图牌和12,687个标注车牌，用于解决车牌识别中遇到的车牌可读性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别(ALPR)系统在处理可读性差的车牌时效果不佳，虽然有超分辨率等重建方法，但核心问题仍未解决。需要选择性地应用图像前处理来提高效率。

Method: 构建了一个细粒度标注的数据集，包含车辆和车牌层面的遮挡信息、四个可读性类别(完美、良好、差、不可读)以及字符标签。作为基准，使用三种图像识别网络(ViT、ResNet、YOLO)进行分类任务。

Result: 三个基线模型的总体F1分数均低于80%，ViT模型表现最好为79.6%，ResNet为78.8%，YOLO为77.7%，显示了该任务的高难度。

Conclusion: 该研究高亮了车牌可读性分类任务的挑战性，并为该领域的进一步研究提供了丰富的数据资源。数据集已公开可用，以便更多研究人员参与该领域的研究。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用视觉语言模型在医疗专业领域诊断准确性有限、模型过大导致推理成本高的问题，实现临床部署的可行性

Method: 采用专家-通才框架：轻量级域训练图像分类器（专家）提供快速准确诊断预测，压缩对话VLM（通才）生成自然语言解释，专家预测指导通才推理，结合知识图谱检索确保事实准确性

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上诊断准确率比最强基线提高18%，平均VRAM需求降低至少20%，延迟降低至少5%

Conclusion: 专家-通才系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

*Md. Rashid Shahriar Khan,Md. Abrar Hasan,Mohammod Tareq Aziz Justice*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型，通过时空动态建模和语义上下文理解，无需异常样本训练即可检测监控视频中的异常事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件具有不可预测性和上下文依赖性。传统方法需要异常样本进行训练，而零样本方法能够检测未见过的异常行为。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干网络提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示以识别时间偏差，CLIP基于语义流通过上下文特定文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 该框架能够整合预测建模和视觉语言理解，在复杂环境中泛化到先前未见的行为，填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理和语义上下文之间的空白。

Conclusion: 通过结合时空建模和语义上下文理解，该工作为监控视频中的零样本异常检测提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源供研究使用。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has

*Ajinkya Khoche,Qingwen Zhang,Yixi Cai,Sina Sharif Mansouri,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一个新颖的自监督框架，通过4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，并转移到LiDAR域，无需人工标注即可实现3D场景流估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D场景流估计中大规模人工标注数据集的瓶颈问题，当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景下性能不足，而监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展。

Method: 采用跨模态标签转移方法，利用4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和模糊解析传播将标签转移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著超越现有自监督方法，仅使用10%的标注数据就能达到全监督方法90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow提供了一种可扩展的自监督解决方案，有效解决了3D场景流估计中的标注瓶颈问题，在自动驾驶动态环境导航中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

TL;DR: SatSkylines是一个从卫星图像和粗糙几何先验生成3D建筑的方法，通过建模从噪声粗糙先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活的几何控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像中恢复准确的建筑结构，而3D细节化方法需要高度详细的体素输入，无法从简单先验（如立方体）产生满意结果。

Method: 通过建模从插值噪声粗糙先验到详细几何的转换，实现无需额外计算成本的灵活几何控制，并开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该模型有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines方法成功解决了从卫星图像和简单几何先验生成详细3D建筑的挑战，为建筑生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种两阶段深度学习模型，用于从游戏帧中检测可穿越空间过渡点（STP）并选择主要过渡点（MSTP），为游戏导航和关卡设计提供基础技术支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，高效识别地图过游点对客户端自动地图生成和关卡设计评估至关重要。需要一种对单帧游戏图像进行过游点检测的对象化方法。

Method: 使用两阶段深度学习流水线：第一阶段用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，第二阶段用轻量级MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征进行排名。采用参数高效适配器，还包含可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在五款动作RPG游戏的自建数据集上验证。完整网络微调在数据充足时STP检测效果更好，而适配器仅转移在少数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健高效。

Conclusion: 论文定义了一个新的研究问题，提供了基线流水线和数据集，为未来AI驱动导航辅助和数据驱动关卡设计工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动角色动画方法主要针对语音和歌唱场景，但在复杂的影视制作中（需要细腻角色交互、真实身体动作和动态镜头）表现不足，需要实现电影级别的角色动画。

Method: 基于Wan框架构建音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过改进模型架构来增强在电影场景中的表现力和保真度。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V成功解决了电影级别角色动画的长期挑战，为复杂影视制作提供了高质量的音频驱动动画解决方案，在表现力和应用范围方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临两个关键挑战：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合，限制动态融合能力；MoE融合中专家网络处理分离特征，限制了特征间信息交互

Method: 提出DeReF框架，包含模态解耦、随机特征重组和动态MoE融合模块，并在解耦模块中引入区域交叉注意力网络提升特征表示质量

Result: 在内部肝癌数据集和三个TCGA公共数据集上的广泛实验结果证实了所提方法的有效性

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过随机特征重组策略增强了特征组合多样性，克服了信息封闭问题，提高了专家网络对解耦特征间信息的捕捉能力

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射等）时表现不佳，主要缺乏配对的监督数据。本文旨在系统性地研究对象对环境的影响并解决这些副作用问题。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器实现视频修复模型；通过参考式擦除定位所有对象相关区域；引入额外监督显式预测受副作用影响的区域。

Result: ROSE在视频对象擦除方面表现出优越性能，能够很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景，在包含五种特殊副作用的ROSE-Bench基准测试中取得最佳结果。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了视频对象移除中的副作用问题，通过合成数据生成和先进的模型架构实现了高质量的视觉效果，为视频编辑领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 本文提出了OwlCap视频字幕生成模型，通过构建HMD-270K数据集和引入CSER奖励机制，解决了现有方法中运动细节不平衡的问题，在VDC和DREAM-1K基准测试中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动细节不平衡问题，模型往往过度强调一个方面而忽视另一个方面，导致生成的字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：通过两阶段流程（运动细节融合和细粒度检查）构建HMD-270K数据集；2) 优化层面：基于组相对策略优化引入字幕集等价奖励(CSER)，通过单元到集合匹配和双向验证增强完整性和准确性。

Result: OwlCap在细节导向的VDC基准上提升4.2 Acc，在运动导向的DREAM-1K基准上提升4.6 F1，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的HMD-270K数据集和OwlCap模型有效解决了视频字幕生成中的运动细节不平衡问题，为视频字幕研究社区提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SNR先验的水下图像增强方法在空间域存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面帮助有限

Method: 提出傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)，在频域分解特征为振幅和相位谱；设计频率自适应变换器(FAT)瓶颈，通过门控注意力机制融合高低频分支；构建统一U型架构，整合RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，PSNR提升3.1 dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验比空间域方法更有效，SFormer在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法，为水下图像增强提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Motivation: 现有研究虽然实现了良好的分割性能，但在EF估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来改善EF计算准确性

Method: 采用分层设计：低层级使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层级使用Mamba架构捕获时空关系；提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块，通过跨帧和跨位置的跳跃扫描整合长程上下文信息

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免仅依赖单帧时的局部误差累积或仅使用多帧数据时的细节忽略问题

Conclusion: 所提出的分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节建模和全局动态感知，有效减轻了超声图像噪声等因素引起的EF计算偏差

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: FPS是一种新颖的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来解决域偏移问题，避免了传统微调方法的低效性和不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和难以扩展到现代架构的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，冻结预训练特征编码器，利用特征空间的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界，支持离线特征提取和全数据集单次计算优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS达到或优于最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色适应性。

Conclusion: FPS为迁移学习提供了一个简单、有效且通用的范式，特别适用于域适应任务，具有显著降低内存和计算成本的优势。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Conclusion: 该框架提供了轻量级、可扩展的HAR解决方案，适用于智能监控、辅助技术、公共安全等资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as

demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in

*Qun Ji,Peng Li,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColorGS是一个用于内窥镜视频中可变形组织高保真重建的新框架，通过自适应颜色编码和增强变形建模，在达芬奇机器人手术视频上实现了39.85 PSNR的state-of-the-art性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配和线性变形建模无法处理复杂纹理和一致的全局变形。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间无关变形。

Result: 在DaVinci机器人手术视频和EndoNeRF、StereoMIS基准数据集上，ColorGS达到PSNR 39.85（比之前3DGS方法高1.5），SSIM 97.25%，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中引导和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

TL;DR: 类别泛浆正则化方法，通过根据类别频率设置不同的泛浆阈值，在不平衡数据集上提升少数类的识别性能和整体泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在不平衡数据集上训练时对多数类偏见的问题，提高少数类的识别性能

Method: 提出类别泛浆正则化，根据类别频率设置不同的泛浆阈值，压制多数类过拟合同时充分学习少数类

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上，方法提升了少数类的分类性能和整体泛化能力，效果超过传统泛浆正则化

Conclusion: 类别泛浆正则化是有效的方法，能够在不平衡数据集上同时提升少数类和整体的识别性能

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADM难度度量方法，结合课程学习和SAM优化，解决平坦区域中样本难度评估难题，提升模型泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习依赖损失值或梯度范数评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些指标变得无效，无法有效结合课程学习和SAM优化

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化样本难度，并将其集成到基于SAM的课程学习框架中

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域泛化任务上验证，方法同时保持了课程学习和SAM的优势，性能优于现有课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM提供了一种在平坦区域有效评估样本难度的方法，成功实现了课程学习与SAM优化的结合，显著提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

TL;DR: 本文分析了水下目标检测中扇贝类别性能不佳的原因，发现前景-背景区分是主要问题，建议根据精度或召回率优先选择不同的数据分布策略，并推荐改进定位模块算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测面临图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡等挑战，不同物种检测性能差异显著但原因不明，需要探究数据量之外的影响因素并系统提升弱势海洋物种的检测性能。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类别的性能问题，进行定位分析和分类实验。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最困难的环节；分类实验显示即使数据平衡仍存在精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类间依赖的内在特征挑战。

Conclusion: 优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回率时使用平衡分布；改进弱势类别应聚焦算法进步，特别是定位模块的优化；已公开代码和数据集。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Motivation: 现有CAD生成方法主要从点云、网格或文本输入生成实体模型，与传统工业工作流程从2D工程图开始存在根本差异，从2D矢量图自动生成参数化CAD模型的研究仍不足。

Method: 提出Drawing2CAD框架，包含三个关键技术：网络友好的矢量图元表示、双解码器transformer架构（解耦命令类型和参数生成）、软目标分布损失函数。创建CAD-VGDrawing配对数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 通过全面实验证明了方法的有效性，代码和数据集已开源。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将CAD生成重新定义为序列到序列学习问题，在保持几何精度和设计意图的同时实现了从2D工程图到参数化CAD模型的自动转换。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Method: 使用音频-视觉特征融合的路由器，基于token级声学损坏分数自适应重新加权音频和视觉特征，通过门控交叉注意力机制在解码器层中降权不可靠音频token并增强视觉线索

Result: 在LRS3数据集上相比AV-HuBERT实现了16.51-42.67%的词错误率相对降低，消融研究证实路由器和门控机制都有助于在真实声学噪声下提升鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态模态权重调整有效提升了音频-视觉语音识别在噪声环境中的性能，为鲁棒的多模态语音识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI标准测评协议要求准确匹配标注类别，与生成式VLM的多重合理解释特性不匹配，导致合理预测被错误罚，需要新的评价方案。

Method: 将HOI检测重构为多选题任务，每道题包含真实正确选项和细心筛选的负面选项（避免包含合理但未标注的解释），支持多答案选择。

Result: 提出了首个既适用于VLM又适用于专门HOI方法的评价协议，能够更公平地评估不同方法的HOI理解能力。

Conclusion: 新的多选题评价方案有助于更准确地评估HOI检测模型的性能，为VLM和专门方法提供了公平的对比平台，推动HOI理解领域的进步。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本选项的多选题生成，忽视了视觉选项的重要性，且高质量干扰项的生成成本高、扩展性差。

Method: 采用跨模态选项合成框架，整合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，包含内容判别模块来识别适合视觉选项的内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，CmOS在内容判别、问题生成和视觉选项生成方面优于现有方法，适用于不同学科和教育水平。

Conclusion: CmOS框架成功解决了教育多选题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量多选题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 不同字体样式传递不同的印象，字体形状与印象标签存在紧密联系。标准词嵌入方法如BERT和CLIP为相似印象标签生成差异过大的向量，不适合印象基于的字体处理任务。

Method: 构建一个图谱，其中节点代表印象标签，边缘编码标签间的共现关系。然后应用语义图谜嵌入技术为每个标签生成印象向量。

Result: 与BERT和CLIP相比，该方法能够为相似印象标签分配相似向量，在定性和定量评估中都表现更优，特别在印象导向的字体生成任务上。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新题签嵌入方法能够更好地捕捉字体形状与印象标签之间的关系，为印象基于的字体处理应用提供了更有效的表示方法。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

including severe class imbalance, high morphological variability, and domain
heterogeneity across different tumor types, species, and scanners. Through
strategic preprocessing with 60% center cropping and mixed precision training,
our model achieved robust performance on the diverse MIDOG 2025 dataset. The

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Conclusion: 该方法能够让现代稳傲器超越传统方法，同时保持全帧特性并提供类似于经典方法的用户控制机制。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Motivation: 医疗诊断中确保跨人口群体的公平性至关重要，特别是在影像设备和临床实践变化导致的分布偏移下。现有去偏方法通常独立处理视觉和文本模态，存在残差跨模态不对齐和公平性差距。

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，构建近似正交文本锚点引导跨注意力机制，使用超网络生成实例感知视觉提示，并应用基于原型的正则化来增强特征分离和对齐。

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集和4种模态上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数就优于全微调和参数高效基线。

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医疗影像诊断中的公平性问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了模型公平性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要针对性增强

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询；2) 设计交互语义融合模块利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改进交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性的性能表现

Conclusion: DQEN通过分别增强对象和交互查询，有效提升了HOI检测的准确性，证明了针对性查询增强策略的有效性

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶AI决策难以解释，特别是在复杂城市场景中，深度神经网络的非线性决策边界使得理解AI驱动决策的逻辑具有挑战性。

Method: 提出促进模型可解释性的损失函数，生成稀疏和局部化的特征图，通过特征激活来解释哪些图像区域对预测控制命令有贡献。

Result: 单目非集成模型在CARLA排行榜上超越了顶级方法，实现了更低的事故分数和最高的路线完成率，同时确保了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了自动驾驶AI的可解释性，而且可解释性的提升与减少事故相关，产生了更安全、高性能的驾驶模型。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Conclusion: 本研究为后续完整的定量分析和人群动力学研究中的行人模拟与空间设计验证建立了基础框架

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Conclusion: USO成功证明了风格驱动和主体驱动生成可以在统一框架下实现，通过解耦学习和奖励学习机制有效解决了这两个任务的对抗性问题

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

Method: 提出隐私保护评估协议，并开发ppNeSF模型，使用自监督学习的分割标签而非RGB图像进行训练，分割标签足够粗糙以隐藏可识别细节但保持3D区分性

Result: ppNeSF在视觉定位任务中取得了最先进的结果，同时有效保护了隐私

Conclusion: 基于分割监督的NeRF变体能够在保持视觉定位精度的同时有效解决隐私保护问题

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

*Shaivi Malik,Hasnat Md Abdullah,Sriparna Saha,Amit Sheth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS是一个用于评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)在性别、种族、年龄和肤色方面人口统计偏见的基准测试，提出了可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标，测试发现现有VLMs存在严重偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的广泛使用，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估方法来检测和量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色四个维度，设计了GRAS偏见评分这一可解释的量化指标，并对5个最先进的VLMs进行了评估。

Result: 测试结果显示VLMs存在严重的偏见问题，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分），同时发现评估VQA偏见时需要考虑问题的多种表述方式。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试揭示了VLMs存在显著的人口统计偏见，强调了在VQA评估中考虑问题表述多样性的重要性，为模型偏见检测提供了重要工具和洞察。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

TL;DR: 基于Transformer编码器-解码器的端到端网络RoofSeg，通过边缘感知模块和平面几何损失，提高了机载LiDAR点云屋顶平面分割的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个问题：非真正端到端、边缘区域特征辨别力低、平面几何特征利用不充分

Method: 设计Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询预测平面实例掩码；添加边缘感知模块(EAMM)提升边缘区域辨别力；采用适应性权重策略和新的平面几何损失约束网络训练

Result: 实现了真正的端到端屋顶平面分割，提高了边缘区域的分割准确性，几何特征得到更好利用

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络通过Transformer架构和专门设计的模块，有效解决了屋顶平面分割中的关键问题，为3D建筑模型重建提供了更准确的基础

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

TL;DR: 微塑料污染严重，本文提出MicroDetect-Net模型，结合莖红染料燃光显微镜咆深度学习，在血液样本中检测微塑料达到92%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料污染已成为全球急诫环境问题，对人体健康造成肠道伤害、肝脏感染等危害，需要有效的检测方法

Method: 使用莖红染料燃光显微镜染色技术，结合卷积神经网络构建MicroDetect-Net模型，通过图像分割定位和计数血液样本中的微塑料粒子

Result: 在276张莖红染料燃光血液图像数据集上，模型达到92%准确率、87.4% IoU、92.1% F1分数、90.6%精确度咆93.7%召回率

Conclusion: MicroDetect-Net模型在微塑料检测中表现優异，为人类血液样本的微塑料监测提供了有效的技术路径，将在环境健康监测中发挥重要作用

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

TL;DR: ProPy是一个基于CLIP的模型，通过提示金字塔结构和祖先-后代交互机制，在部分相关视频检索任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分相关视频检索(PRVR)是一个实用但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：(1)提示金字塔结构，组织事件提示以捕获多粒度语义；(2)祖先-后代交互机制，实现事件间的动态语义交互。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了之前的模型。

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性地适配CLIP架构，成功解决了PRVR任务，证明了预训练视觉-语言模型在该领域的有效性。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

TL;DR: 利用大规模几何血管模型数据集进行自监督预训练，提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力评估的准确性，即使在有限临床数据下也能有效工作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗大数据在心血管健康领域应用前景广阔，但训练机器学习模型需要大量数据。现有方法面临数据稀缺挑战，特别是在冠状动脉血流动力学生物标志物评估方面缺乏充分研究

Method: 使用8449个3D血管几何模型进行自监督预训练，通过计算热核签名（基于拉普拉斯特征向量）作为学习目标，然后将学到的几何表示应用于小规模临床试验数据（49名患者）的壁剪切应力评估

Result: 研究表明，从大规模几何数据集中学习到的表示能够显著提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力的区域分割准确性，即使在有限训练数据情况下也能获得良好性能

Conclusion: 自监督预训练和基础模型能够有效解决医疗数据稀缺问题，几何表示学习为血流动力学生物标志物评估提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是在数据有限的实际临床场景中

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Motivation: 现有表面缺陷检测方法难以满足工业对高性能、高效率和适应性的需求，无法适应真实制造过程中多样的数据标注场景。

Method: 基于SimpleNet构建，引入新颖的合成异常生成过程、增强的分类头和改进的学习过程，支持四种监督场景的统一训练。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一多样化监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决真实制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定照明条件下静态或低运动场景中，事件盘无法生成事件，影响计算机视觉任务的执行。现有方案需要复杂硬件或额外光学组件。

Method: 使用简单旋转不平衡质量产生周期性震动，结合运动补偿管线去除注入运动，获得清洁的事件数据。

Result: 在硬件原型和实际采集数据集上验证，方法可靠恢复运动参数，在图像重建和边缘检测任务上都得到改善。

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法通过人工震动使事件盘在各种场景下持续生成事件，提高了事件基感知的性能和可用性。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的少样本学习方法，通过结合UNet++模型和拓扑感知损失函数，在仅需3个注释页面的情况下实现了历史文档文本行分割的高精度识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，而这些数据缺乏且注释成本高，因此需要少样本学习方法来降低数据需求。

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++模型结合拓扑感知损失函数，明确惩罚线条碎片化和错误合并等结构错误。从每个手稿仅提取3个注释页面中提取小块进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著提升了识别精度：识别准确率提高了200%，行交并比提高了75%，F-Measure分数超过或与DIVA-HisDB基准比赛冠军相当。

Conclusion: 这种简单但有效的方法证明了小型模型结合拓扑感知损失函数在历史文档分割任务中的优势，能够在极少注释数据下实现优异性能。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对单目3D视觉定位任务中预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，提出了3D文本增强(3DTE)和文本引导几何增强(TGE)两种方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略测量单位，导致即使物理长度相同但单位不同时性能严重下降，表明预训练语言模型3D理解能力薄弱。

Method: 1) 3DTE预处理方法：通过增强文本查询中距离描述符的多样性来提升不同单位间映射关系的理解；2) TGE模块：将基础文本特征投影到几何一致空间，利用3D增强文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上取得显著改进，在"Far"场景中准确率提升11.94%，达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提出的两种简单有效方法成功增强了模型对文本嵌入和几何特征的3D感知能力，解决了单位敏感性导致的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Weierstrass椭圆函数位置编码(WEF-PE)，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的双周期特性与视觉数据的平移不变性模式对齐，在多个视觉任务上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer使用的一维位置编码破坏了图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力。

Method: 利用Weierstrass椭圆函数的非线性几何特性自然编码空间距离关系，通过代数加法公式从绝对编码直接推导任意补丁对之间的相对位置信息，实现二维坐标的直接处理。

Result: 在ViT-Tiny架构上CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进，理论分析证实距离衰减特性，注意力可视化显示增强的几何归纳偏置。

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过数学原理性的方法有效解决了二维空间位置编码问题，为Vision Transformer提供了更好的空间几何理解能力，在多个视觉任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Result: 顶点数量降至现有方法的23%，生成速度提升8倍以上，网格质量更高

Conclusion: 分离顶点和面片生成的框架能够显著提高网格生成效率和质量

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider提供了一种高效、灵活的属性编辑解决方案，解决了传统方法的参数冗余和扩展性问题，具有广泛的实际应用价值

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Conclusion: 该方法成功填补了现有方法的空白，提供了既具有几何基础又高度可控的大规模3D场景生成解决方案

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Method: 1. 利用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示，提供高级语义指导；2. 引入具有伪最后一帧设计的专门Multimodal DiT架构，有效融合多模态输入并缓解模态间冲突。

Result: 在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、运动自然度和与文本提示的语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先性能，并能扩展到多人和非人类角色的复杂场景。

Conclusion: 该框架通过语义理解和多模态融合技术，成功生成了既物理合理又语义连贯的富有表现力的角色动画，展示了在复杂场景中的出色扩展性。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了现有方法只能静态分析或需要手动初始化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管是纳米技术的关键构建块，但其动态生长的表征受到扫描电子显微镜成像中纳米级运动测量实验挑战的限制。现有方法只能提供静态分析，而原位技术通常需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的逐粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack集成了手工制作或深度特征检测器和匹配器，在粒子跟踪框架内实现碳纳米管微柱生长的运动学分析。通过13,540条手动注释轨迹的系统评估，确定了ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器的最佳组合。

Result: 最佳组合获得F1分数0.78和α分数0.89。VFTrack运动向量分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，有助于计算异质区域生长速率和重建演化的碳纳米管柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分割方法在处理无提示分割时存在碎片化问题，需要任务特定模型和流水线，缺乏统一的解决方案

Method: 将流式视频分割重新定义为序列掩码预测，构建基于状态空间模型的AUSM架构，保持固定大小的空间状态并支持任意长度视频流，所有组件支持跨帧并行训练

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS等标准基准测试中优于先前方法，16帧序列训练速度提升达2.5倍

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示式和无提示视频分割，通过并行训练实现显著速度提升，为通用视频分割提供了有效的单一架构解决方案

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，缺乏标准化的评估基准。为了促进该领域的发展，需要建立一个全面的基准套件来标准化评估并推动技术进步。

Method: 提出了Style4D框架，基于4D高斯泼溅技术，包含三个关键组件：基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（使用轻量级MLP进行时空感知外观控制）以及整体几何保持风格转换模块（通过对比一致性学习和结构内容保持增强时空一致性）。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench有望成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究中基准测试和推进研究的重要资源，为4D风格化领域提供了标准化的评估框架。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一个无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法使用改进的图像生成器创建目标图像，并通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型取得了进展，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态的任务仍然具有挑战性。需要一种能够保持网格原始身份同时实现自由形式姿态操作的方法。

Method: 1) 使用自注意力重连机制(RSActrl)改进图像生成器，使其能在不同姿态下保持结构一致性；2) 通过关键点建立输入图像与目标图像之间的对应关系，而不是使用可微分渲染；3) 进行多视角姿态优化来对齐网格。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示下都有效，成功操纵姿态同时保持网格原始身份。定量评估和用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，通过语言指令实现3D资产的姿态控制，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了高质量的姿态操作。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Motivation: 现有方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型，难以精确保持未编辑区域的连贯性，需要一种直接在3D空间中精确编辑的方法。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹获取潜在表示和键值令牌，然后在去噪编辑阶段用反转的潜在表示替换保留区域的特征，保持上下文一致性。

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench数据集上实验表明，VoxHammer在保持区域3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了有效解决方案，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Result: 建立了能够建模反讽、同音异义和歧义的语义结构，提出了从递归收敛到语义连贯性产生真正意义的新认知架构

Conclusion: 真正的意义产生于向语义连贯性的递归收敛而非模拟，这需要一种旨在塑造语言而不仅仅是预测语言的全新认知架构

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

Conclusion: 多语言网页可访问性存在系统性忽视，需要语言感知的自动化工具来改善非拉丁语系用户的可访问性体验

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

Conclusion: backprompting技术能够有效生产生产级质量标签数据，为监管检测器开发提供了可靠的数据支撑，在保持高性能的同时大大减少模型规模和计算成本。

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

*Ivan Kobyzev,Abbas Ghaddar,Dingtao Hu,Boxing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Integral Transformer通过积分采样logit分布来降噪注意力，在保留特殊标记重要性的同时减少注意力噪声，在多个基准测试中优于传统和变体注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统softmax自注意力机制会给语义信息较少的特殊标记和标点符号分配过多权重（注意力噪声），而现有方法如Cog Attention和Differential Transformer虽然引入负注意力分数但可能丢失有用信息。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer自注意力机制，通过对logit分布进行信号采样积分来降噪注意力，在减少噪声的同时保留对模型性能关键的特殊标记贡献。

Result: 在成熟的知识和推理语言基准测试中，该模型优于vanilla、Cog和Differential注意力变体。分析显示在底层使用传统自注意力可提升性能，且Integral Transformer能有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层秩塌陷。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer提供了一种有效的注意力降噪方法，既能处理注意力噪声问题，又能保持关键信息的完整性，在Transformer架构中实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LSC是一种新的自一致性方法，使用可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，在短形式和长形式推理任务上均优于现有方法，计算开销可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM概率解码在复杂或长形式问题上输出不一致的问题，现有方法在短形式和长形式任务间存在准确率权衡

Method: 使用可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，通过轻量级前向生成摘要token，推理时间增加小于1%且无需修改模型架构

Result: 在6个短形式和5个长形式推理基准测试中，LSC在所有任务上平均超越SC、USC和WUCS，同时提供良好校准的置信度估计

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨答案格式一致性选择方法，计算开销极小且性能优越

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了OOD评估的假设，发现在QA任务中不同OOD数据集对模型鲁棒性的评估质量差异很大，有些甚至不如简单的分布内评估。作者提出了更稳健的泛化评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究主要通过OOD数据集评估模型泛化能力，但这种方法基于一个强假设：OOD评估能够捕捉真实部署中的失败模式。本文质疑这一假设的有效性。

Method: 通过将OOD评估结果与现有QA模型中记录的具体失败模式（如对虚假特征的依赖）进行对比，分析不同OOD数据集在评估模型对预测捷径鲁棒性方面的质量差异。

Result: 发现不同OOD数据集提供的模型鲁棒性估计质量差异很大，有些数据集的表现甚至不如简单的分布内评估。部分原因是虚假捷径在ID和OOD数据集间共享，但也存在训练和评估质量脱节的情况。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了常用OOD泛化评估方法的局限性，为在QA及其他领域更稳健地评估泛化能力提供了方法论和建议。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

TL;DR: 分析不同训练方法对LLM在重排序任务中语义理解的影响，研究模型是否能生成更有信息量的文本推理来提升透明度和解决有限训练数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM语义理解能力提升，其与人类价值观更一致但透明度下降，且在新系统中缺乏用户参与和排名数据时，准确重排序仍具挑战性。需要深入理解LLM内部工作机制来解释重排序推理。

Method: 使用环境与地球科学领域的相对较小排名数据集对检索内容进行重排序，分析不同训练方法对LLM语义理解的影响，并检查可解释信息以验证重排序是否可通过解释性进行推理。

Result: 研究发现某些训练方法比其他方法表现出更好的可解释性，表明并非所有训练方法都学习了准确的语义理解，而是获得了抽象知识来优化评估，这对LLM的真正可靠性提出了疑问。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究不同训练方法如何影响LLM在重排序任务中的语义理解能力，以及模型是否能生成更有信息量的文本推理来解决透明度和有限训练数据的挑战。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决波兰语中由于历史和政治惯例导致的男性形式主导问题，以及LLMs因此继承和强化的性别偏见问题。

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（人工制作的性别包容性校对和翻译指令）调优多语言和波兰语专用LLMs，设计包含明确性别包容性指南的系统提示。

Result: 成功对Llama-8B、Mistral-7B、Mistral-Nemo、Bielik和PLLuM等模型进行了IPIS调优。

Conclusion: 该方法为减轻波兰语生成中的性别偏见提供了系统性解决方案，使性别包容性成为模型的固有特征。

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)虽然功能强大，但容易产生幻觉，即生成看似自信但实际上错误或无意义的回答。需要有效的方法来检测这些幻觉。

Method: 将幻觉检测问题形式化为假设检验问题，借鉴多重检验的思想，提出了一种新的检测方法，并与机器学习中的分布外检测问题进行类比。

Conclusion: 提出的多重检验启发式方法能够有效检测LLM产生的幻觉，为解决LLM可靠性问题提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的机器翻译自动评估指标COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic，通过引入多个候选翻译或相似文本的翻译示例来提升评估性能，相比单翻译评估方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器翻译自动评估指标通常只考虑源句子和单个翻译，而人类评估时会参考多个备选翻译，这种评估设置差异可能影响自动指标的性能。

Method: COMET-polycand使用同一源句的多个备选翻译进行比较分析；COMET-polyic借鉴检索式上下文学习，输入相似源文本的翻译及其人工标注质量分数来指导评估。

Result: COMET-polycand加入单个额外翻译即可提升段级指标性能（Kendall's tau-b相关性从0.079提升到0.118），加入更多翻译效果更好；COMET-polyic通过检索示例获得类似改进（0.079到0.116）。

Conclusion: 引入多个翻译信息能显著提升机器翻译自动评估指标的性能，模型已公开发布。

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时理解语言含义和保持视觉连贯性，现有方法在隐喻对齐方面存在不足，需要更好的评估和改进机制。

Method: 提出自评估框架，包含隐喻分解分数和意义对齐指标；开发两种方法：训练无关的S-T-M提示分解管道和基于自评估奖励的训练方法。

Result: 训练无关方法在分解、CLIP和意义对齐分数上超越GPT-4o和Imagen等强基线；用户研究显示GPT-4o整体更受偏好，但开源方法在抽象隐喻上表现优异。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级强化学习在有限计算资源下能有效进行隐喻对齐，与人类偏好的差距主要来自美学质量和采样设置敏感性。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

TL;DR: 这篇论文主张大语言模型主要是对训练语料库的模拟，而非人类认知能力的直接模型，因为转换器架构的线性计算格式与人类的超线性计算格式存在根本性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型的本质：它们是否真正模拟了人类认知能力，还是仅仅对训练语料库的模拟。作者想要为后者提供一个非解构性的辩护。

Method: 通过对比人类认知科学和转换器架构的计算特性来进行分析。人类语言能力依赖超线性计算格式，而转换器只支持线性处理格式。作者依据转换器计算架构的某些不变性来支持这一论点。

Result: 论文得出结论：LLM不是人类认知能力的直接模型，而是通过不同方式学习使用语言这种"话语机器"。语言不仅仅是表达内部状态的工具，还能在适当上下文中创造新语言。

Conclusion: 这个观点并不是解构性的。LLM通过不同的途径学会了使用语言这种技术，虽然它们的计算方式与人类存在根本差异，但同样能够利用语言进行创造性的产出。

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

Conclusion: NOOV系统有效解决了EHR翻译中的关键挑战，为临床医学翻译提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

Method: 进行广泛的实证研究，建立任务分层缩放定律，将LLM知识分解为记忆和运用能力，并开发包含模型大小、有效位宽、校准集大小和分组大小的统一量化框架

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对PTQ影响的细粒度理解，并为开发能够更好保护目标认知功能的知识感知量化策略提供了指导

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务（如数学）中表现不佳，原因是训练数据中缺乏人类推理时的内在思维过程（意图和方法论），这些关键信息对于连接推理步骤至关重要。

Method: 提出Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS)框架，在连续推理步骤间主动生成insights来回顾状态并启动下一步推理。设计自动化流水线收集和筛选上下文示例用于insight生成，避免人工标注和微调开销。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上的实验验证了TBYS的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过主动生成insights来模拟人类仔细思考的过程，TBYS框架成功弥补了LLMs训练数据与人类推理模式之间的差距，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

Motivation: 当前LLMs在整合外部知识时难以同时保持忠实性和表达性，导致输出要么缺乏知识支持，要么过于冗长不自然。需要解决这一权衡问题。

Method: 提出CoDe框架：1）基于分布散度和模型置信度动态整合有/无外部知识的输出概率；2）引入知识感知重排序机制，防止过度依赖参数知识同时确保外部信息利用。

Result: 通过全面实验验证，CoDe框架在不同LLMs和评估指标上均表现出色，在保持表达性的同时显著提升了忠实性，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoDe作为一种即插即用框架，成功解决了LLMs在知识整合中忠实性与表达性的权衡问题，为缓解幻觉提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

TL;DR: 提出基于教学原则的MCoT提示选择框架，通过模型感知难度和样本内在复杂度双信号分析，实现难度平衡的提示样本选择，显著提升多模态推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCoT提示使用随机或手动选择的示例，未能考虑模型特定知识分布和任务内在复杂度，导致性能次优且不稳定

Method: 将提示选择重构为提示课程设计问题，整合模型感知难度（通过主动学习中的预测分歧量化）和样本内在复杂度两个互补信号，开发难度平衡采样策略

Result: 在五个挑战性基准和多个流行MLLM上的实验表明，该方法带来显著且一致的改进，大大减少了随机采样导致的性能差异

Conclusion: 该方法为增强多模态推理提供了原则性和鲁棒性的方法，通过难度平衡的提示选择优化模型性能

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 医学视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中存在答案不一致性问题，面对语义相同但表述不同的问题时表现脆弱。研究构建了RoMed数据集并提出了CCL方法，显著提升了模型的一致性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言模型在面对语义相同但表述不同的医学问题时，答案会出现显著波动，这种不一致性在高风险医疗应用中可能导致不可靠的诊断结果。

Method: 构建了包含14.4万个问题的RoMed数据集，涵盖词汇级、句子级和语义级扰动。提出了CCL方法，包含知识锚定一致性学习和偏差感知对比学习两个核心组件。

Result: 在RoMed测试集上，现有SOTA模型（如LLaVA-Med）的召回率下降40%。CCL方法在三个流行VQA基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并将答案一致性提升了50%。

Conclusion: CCL方法通过整合医学知识一致性和偏差感知对比学习，有效解决了医学视觉语言模型的答案不一致性问题，显著提升了模型在医疗应用中的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大模型在通用领域表现良好，但在处理领域特定术语和新词时准确率不足，需要一种轻量级、灵活且准确的术语识别方法

Method: 提出Attention2Probability方法，将语音与术语间的交叉注意力权重转换为存在概率，并采用课程学习提升检索精度；同时构建了包含术语的语音数据集

Result: 在测试集上显著优于VectorDB方法，中文最大召回率达92.57%，英文达86.83%，单查询延迟仅8.71ms；术语干预使SLM的术语准确率提升6-17%

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SLM在领域术语识别方面的局限性，但当前SLM对术语的利用仍存在不足，需要进一步改进

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言谜语生成需要平衡文化流畅性和创造性抽象，但现有提示策略往往重复记忆的谜语或进行浅层改写，无法产生真正新颖的内容。

Method: 提出AOF框架，使用基于余弦相似度的拒绝过滤冗余生成，同时强制执行词汇新颖性和跨语言保真度，无需任务特定的微调。

Result: 在三个LLM和四个语言对的评估中，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语上达到0.177 Self-BLEU和0.915 Distinct-2，表明词汇多样性提升且冗余减少。

Conclusion: 语义拒绝方法可以引导文化基础扎实的创造性生成，为多语言创意内容生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

Motivation: 当前广告标题生成方法主要优化质量或点击率，忽视了多样性需求，导致输出同质化严重，无法满足不同受众群体的需求。

Method: 设计了语义和风格感知的数据生成管道自动产生高质量训练对，采用多阶段多目标优化框架，结合监督微调和强化学习，在单次前向传播中生成高质量多样化标题。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上有效平衡质量和多样性，在大规模内容分享平台部署后，广告价值提升4.0%，点击率提升1.4%。

Conclusion: DIVER框架成功解决了广告标题生成中质量与多样性的平衡问题，为大规模广告平台提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

Motivation: 现有MECTEC任务面临数据集稀缺（只有一个高度统一的对话场景数据集）和现有方法无法显式建模情感因果上下文、忽视多层级语义信息融合的问题

Method: 提出M3HG模型，通过多模态异构图显式捕捉情感和因果上下文，并在话语间和话语内两个层级有效融合上下文信息

Result: 大量实验证明M3HG相比现有最先进方法具有显著有效性

Conclusion: M3HG模型和MECAD数据集为多模态多场景的情感原因三元组提取提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The
codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构连贯段落和保持时间顺序来提升长上下文问答性能，在NarrativeQA数据集上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG索引方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要更广泛的上下文和段落间的时序关系，而不仅仅是孤立片段。

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个方面：将分散的文档信息重构为连贯的结构化段落；通过显式捕捉和维护检索段落间的时间顺序来保持叙事流。

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验表明，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂时序关系理解的任务中取得了实质性改进。

Conclusion: 时序推理对于解决叙事问答问题至关重要，ChronoRAG通过专门处理叙事文本的独特特性，有效提升了长上下文问答性能。

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具有强大的推理能力，但计算成本控制仍是实际部署的重大挑战。开源社区缺乏像GPT-4o那样的可控推理能力。

Method: 采用端到端训练范式：预算模式监督微调将可控推理能力嵌入学习过程，以及两阶段预算感知强化学习与自适应奖励塑造。

Result: 实现了目标压缩-性能权衡，高模式（全能力）、中模式（50% token减少，性能下降<10%）、低模式（75% token减少，性能下降<15%）。

Conclusion: ThinkDial成功实现了可控推理，在显著减少计算量的同时保持性能阈值，并在分布外任务上展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Result: 在中文数据集上实现了最先进的性能，召回率显著提升

Conclusion: 使用强化学习引导大语言模型具有明显优势，为语法纠错领域的未来发展提供了更可控和可靠的范式

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans为翻译LaTeX格式文档提供了一个有效且实用的解决方案，能够很好地保持格式和结构完整性

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Result: 大量实验表明，该自监督框架在有限标注数据集下仍优于最先进方法，并提高了泛化能力

Conclusion: 结合语义和传播特征的自监督方法能有效区分真假新闻，在资源受限场景下具有优越性能

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

Motivation: LLM在科学、法律、医疗等高风险领域部署时，经常以高置信度生成错误答案（过度自信），现有方法效果有限且泛化性差

Method: 提出ConfTuner微调方法，使用理论证明为proper scoring rule的tokenized Brier score损失函数，无需真实置信度标签或代理估计

Result: 在多种推理任务上显著改善校准效果，泛化到GPT-4o等黑盒模型，下游应用如自我纠正和模型级联获得提升

Conclusion: ConfTuner通过proper scoring rule方法有效提升LLM置信度校准，推动可信LLM系统发展

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，自动选择优化提示的需求日益增长，现有方法在搜索精确性和全面性方面仍有改进空间

Method: 基于进化算法的反射进化方法，在交叉和精英变异前进行短期和长期反射操作，积累进化过程中的知识并在每个epoch更新

Result: 在33个分类和文本生成数据集上测试，使用t-lite-instruct-0.1和gemma3-27b-it模型，相比最先进方法平均提升28%（在BBH数据集上）

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt成为进化算法自动提示领域最有效的解决方案之一，通过反射机制显著提升了提示优化的效果

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，用于处理计算教育研究中的大量文本数据，帮助研究者进行大规模、严谨且可重复的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算教育研究(CER)中，研究者常因缺乏同事、资源或能力而难以进行具有普遍性和严谨性的研究。需要一种能够处理大量定性数据而不增加研究者负担的方法。

Method: 提出LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，结合内容分析和大语言模型，使研究者能够进行原本无法完成的大规模研究。通过计算教育数据集展示了该方法的可重复性和严谨性。

Result: LACA方法能够帮助研究者从更广泛的研究中获得更具普遍性的发现，提升研究质量和规模。

Conclusion: LACA方法在计算教育研究中具有重要潜力，结合类似方法的发展，可以推动CER学科实践和研究质量的进步。

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感极化在全球政治话语中日益突出，本研究意在通过自动化方式检测欧洲议会中的这种现象。

Method: 采用自然语言处理技术分析六个欧洲国家议会话语语料，通过比较对投对派和同派人物的负面情感表达来评估情感极化程度。

Result: 在所有六个欧洲议会中都发现了一致的情感极化现象；活跃度与负面情绪相关但不影响极化程度；互息性是情感极化的重要机制。

Conclusion: 情感极化是欧洲政治议会的普遍现象，且通过互息性机制强化，这为理解和应对政治两极分化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估主要集中在性能指标，而忽视了数据集的质量和隐私保护问题，影响评估的可靠性和实际应用价值。

Method: 使用多模态机器人框架：(1)多样性机器人通过聚类技术实现主题覆盖和语义变异性最大化 (2)隐私机器人检测和隐藏多领域敏感信息 (3)QA精选机器人合成具有隐私保护和多样性的QA对作为评估真实标准。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种实用且符合道德规范的方法，为更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估奠定了基础，与时俱进的AI监管和遵循标准对齐。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Method: 引入互补训练目标来增强符号纯度和决策稀疏性，采用顺序专业化策略先建立广泛的符号能力再细化直觉判断，使用符号捕获语义模式、链追踪决策路径、门控归纳机制。

Result: 在AI任务实验中展现出具有竞争力的准确性，同时提供可验证的推理轨迹，证明AI母语可以作为神经网络模型中可解释性、直觉和符号推理的统一机制。

Conclusion: AI母语框架成功实现了将推理直接嵌入模型表示的目标，为神经网络模型提供了同时具备可解释性、直觉推理和符号推理能力的统一解决方案。

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA)
dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content.
Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to
the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach,
utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate
and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we
develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation
potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation
scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves
model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes
to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights
into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with
more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content. Our project page,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂长时程规划任务中缺乏宏观指导和持续监督，容易迷失方向和偏离目标

Method: 分层规划框架：离线阶段构建里程碑库，执行阶段动态生成逐步提示，结合全局里程碑和局部适应性指导

Result: 在两个挑战性基准测试中显著优于强基线，消融研究验证了分层组件的互补效益

Conclusion: HiPlan通过分层规划有效解决了LLM智能体在复杂任务中的导向和监督问题，提升了决策性能

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

Motivation: 医患对话中医生通过针对性提问来诊断和治疗患者，但缺乏对医生意图轨迹的系统研究，需要理解医疗对话的结构和意图转换模式。

Method: 使用ACI-bench数据集，与医学专家合作开发基于SOAP框架的细粒度意图分类法，通过众包平台招募医学专家标注5000+对话轮次，评估state-of-the-art生成式和编码器模型。

Result: 模型能高精度理解医疗对话的一般结构，但在识别SOAP类别转换方面存在困难；首次报告医疗对话结构的常见轨迹；意图过滤显著提升医疗对话摘要性能。

Conclusion: 研究提供了医疗意图分类的重要数据集和基准，揭示了医疗对话结构的模式，为设计"鉴别诊断"系统提供了宝贵见解，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面分析了大语言模型能否通过上下文学习（ICL）支持极低资源语言，比较了ICL与参数高效微调（PEFT）的效果。研究发现对于极低资源语言，零样本ICL结合语言对齐效果显著，而PEFT在语言和文字都极度缺乏表示时效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言，特别是使用稀有文字的语言，在大语言模型中缺乏支持。这主要是由于缺乏训练数据等复合因素造成的。

Method: 系统评估了20种代表性不足的语言，在三种最先进的多语言大语言模型上测试了上下文学习（ICL）和参数高效微调（PEFT）方法。

Result: 当语言及其文字在LLM中极度缺乏表示时，PEFT存在明显局限性。零样本ICL结合语言对齐对极低资源语言效果显著，而少样本ICL或PEFT对相对较好表示的语言更有效。

Conclusion: 为LLM从业者提供了基于结果的指导原则：避免在未见文字的语言上微调多语言模型，零样本ICL是处理极低资源语言的更有效方法。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

Conclusion: 多层次方法能够克服单一方法的局限性，代码层面的透明性、研究人员主动性和方法论三角测量在计算话语研究中至关重要。

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答任务中表现出色但存在幻觉问题，需要可靠地感知自身知识边界（知道什么知道、什么不知道）。

Method: 评估三种置信信号：概率置信度、答案一致性置信度和语言化置信度；从大型语言模型(LLMs)中适配置信度校准方法，并提出三种有效方法；比较LVLMs与LLMs的表现差异。

Result: 实验表明LVLMs具有一定程度的感知能力但仍有很大改进空间；概率和一致性置信信号更可靠，语言化置信度常导致过度自信；视觉和文本联合处理降低了问答性能但提高了感知水平。

Conclusion: LVLMs的知识边界感知能力有待提升，提出的校准方法能有效改善感知性能，多模态处理虽然降低性能但提升了感知准确性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音合成模型在处理长序列多说话人对话时面临计算效率和数据压缩的挑战，需要一种能够高效处理长语音同时保持音频保真度的解决方案。

Method: 采用next-token扩散方法，通过自回归生成潜在向量来建模连续数据；引入新型连续语音分词器，相比Encodec模型实现80倍数据压缩；支持64K上下文窗口长度。

Result: 能够合成长达90分钟的长语音，最多支持4个说话人，在保持音频质量的同时显著提升计算效率，超越了开源和专有对话模型的表现。

Conclusion: VibeVoice通过创新的分词器和扩散方法，成功解决了长语音多说话人合成的技术难题，在计算效率和音频质量方面都取得了显著突破。

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

### [124] [Evaluating the Evaluators: Are readability metrics good measures of readability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19221)
*Isabel Cachola,Daniel Khashabi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对简明语言摘要的可读性评估方法进行了系统研究，发现传统可读性指标与人类判断相关性差，而语言模型能更好地评估可读性，特别是在背景知识需求等深层维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前简明语言摘要领域普遍使用传统可读性指标（如FKGL）进行评估，但这些指标在PLR领域尚未与人类可读性判断进行系统比较，需要验证其有效性。

Method: 评估了8种传统可读性指标与人类判断的相关性，并测试了语言模型作为可读性评估工具的性能，在PLR数据集上进行了深入分析。

Result: 大多数传统可读性指标与人类判断相关性差，最佳语言模型达到0.56的皮尔逊相关系数；语言模型能更好地捕捉背景知识需求等深层可读性维度。

Conclusion: 建议在简明语言摘要评估中使用语言模型替代传统指标，并发布了分析代码和调查数据以供后续研究使用。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

TL;DR: 提出生成式界面框架，让大语言模型主动生成用户界面来替代传统对话式交互，在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中显著提升用户体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性请求-响应格式的对话系统在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中效率低下，需要更自适应的交互方式

Method: 提出生成式语言模型界面范式，利用结构化界面特定表示和迭代优化，将用户查询转换为任务特定的用户界面

Result: 生成式界面在70%以上的情况下被人类用户偏好，在功能、交互和情感体验方面均优于传统对话界面

Conclusion: 生成式界面为人类-AI交互提供了新的发展方向，明确了用户偏好这种交互方式的具体场景和原因

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作式框架，通过分布式深度学习技术来分割缪血性脑梗增病变，解决了不同医疗机构数据差异性和标签数据稀缺的问题，并在14个健康中心的2031份数据上达到了更好的性能和普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑梗作为全球第二大死因，但传统的病变分析存在巨大变异性，而现有的计算方法大多只能在单个机构数据上训练，缺乏普适性，还有许多临床中心缺乏足够的标签数据来调整模型。

Method: 研究使用协作式框架，通过分享深度中心独立表征来实现缪血性脑梗病变的分割。采用FedAvg模型，在14个健康中心的2031份数据上进行训练。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心达到了DSC 0.71±0.24，AVD 5.29±22.74，ALD 2.16±3.60，LF1 0.70±0.26，表现超过了中央化模型和其他协作学习策略。模型显示出强大的普适性，在分布外中心也能达到DSC 0.64±0.29和AVD 4.44±8.74的稳定性能。

Conclusion: 该协作式框架能够有效解决不同医疗机构数据差异性和标签数据稀缺的挑战，为缪血性脑梗病变分割提供了一种具有强普适性的解决方案，在临床应用中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Result: 考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段方法获得了最佳分割分数，超越了专门为此任务开发的复杂专业方法

Conclusion: 对于欠采样MRI数据分割，简单的两阶段方法优于复杂的单阶段方法，为未来研究提供了重要基准和指导

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在传感器RAW数据上操作的端到端扩散模型，通过RAW域VAE和可微分后色调处理模块，解决了传统sRGB域扩散模型的高保真度与真实感生成困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散模型处理有损的sRGB输入，忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景中的可访问性，导致性能次优。特别是在边缘设备图像视频采集等场景中，传统两阶段ISP+IR流程存在局限性。

Method: 1) RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示；2) 可微分后色调处理(PTP)模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化；3) 从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW LQ-HQ对的大规模训练；4) 可配置多拜耳(CMB)LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，以更少的伪影产生更高保真度的结果。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域操作，成功解决了传统扩散模型的高保真度与真实感生成困境，为边缘设备图像处理提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

Method: 使用振动翼型产生氛流扰动，采用热线流速计和PIV技术对流场进行特征化，并观测粒子床上的粒子启动过程

Result: 发现边界层对强制扰动的响应表现为在强制尺度上的额外能量，该流动尺度跨越整个流场并影响到壁面，粒子启动与运输相的大规模流动结构相关

Conclusion: 通过控制振动频率和振幅可以调控流动尺度和能量，实现了"按需"的粒子启动，为激流中粒子运动研究提供了新的实验方法

Abstract: An experimental framework was developed to study the initiation of particle
mobilization in a laboratory setting. Large and heavy particles mobilized by a
turbulent, gaseous carrier-phase were considered. An airfoil oscillated in the
free-stream, generating a tonal free-stream disturbance that perturbed a
turbulent boundary layer. The flow developing behind this forced flow was
characterized using hot-wire anemometry and particle image velocimetry (PIV).
Downstream of the oscillating airfoil mechanism, the turbulent boundary layer
responded to the forcing in the form of excess energy at the forcing scale. The
signature of this forcing scale was observed to span the entire wall-normal
extent of the flow, extending all the way down to the wall. The size of this
flow scale was shown to be controlled by changing the frequency of oscillation,
while the energy in this flow scale was controlled via the amplitude of
oscillation. Demonstrative measurements are presented in which this forced
carrier-phase flow mobilized a particle-phase on a particle bed. A PIV-based
approach was used to measure the initiation of particle motion as well as the
incoming carrier-phase velocity field. The particles on the bed were mobilized
``on-demand'' by the deflection of the airfoil. Consistent with prior work, it
was observed that particle mobilization was correlated with the large-scale
flow structures of the carrier-phase.

Abstract: Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate
complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology,
physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs:
high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and
lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady
assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these
limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models,
we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of
previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000
candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three
key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise
kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been
qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these
mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model
using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in
hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at
low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid
aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding
evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying
robots.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强异向性和异质性对流中非惯性粒子运输特性的影响，特别是激活热替代效应在这种复杂流动中的表现。

Method: 使用粒子图像测速系统(PIV)测量速度场和粒子分布，以及12个E型热电偶的温度探针测量温度分布，在达到约10^8雅史登数的强强制对流中进行实验。

Result: 在强制对流中，水平方向的均匀温度场和粒子数密度的异质性显著强于垂直方向。均匀流体速度结构随底部与顶部壁面温差增加而从单滚模式迁移到双滚模式，在更大温差时又回到单滚模式。粒子密度最大值位于温度最低区域，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 实验结果与激活热替代效应的预测相符，证明在强异向性对流中，温度地置对非惯性粒子的运输和分布具有重要影响，激活热替代效应在这种复杂流动中仍然显著。

Abstract: We investigate properties of turbulence and turbulent transport of
non-inertial particles described in terms of turbulent thermal diffusion in
strongly inhomogeneous and anisotropic convection forced by two turbulence
generators with oscillating membrane and a steady grid in the air flow (with
the Rayleigh number about $10^8$). Velocity field and spatial distribution of
particles are measured using Particle Image Velocimetry system. The temperature
distribution is measured in many locations using a temperature probe equipped
with 12 E - thermocouples. In the forced convection, inhomogeneities of the
mean temperature field and the particle number density in the horizontal
direction in the core flow is much stronger than in the vertical direction. The
mean fluid velocity structure show transition between a single-roll pattern for
isothermal turbulence to double-roll patterns with increase of the temperature
difference between the bottom and upper walls of the chamber. For larger
temperature differences, the mean fluid velocity structure returns to a
single-roll pattern. The maximum of the mean particle number density is located
in the regions with minimum of the mean temperature and vise versa in agreement
with the predictions based on the phenomenon of turbulent thermal diffusion.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了有限旋转圆柱在自由端部影响下三维尾流形成机制，为理解更高鲁森数工业流动提供了重要基础见解

Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulations of flows over finite-aspect-ratio
rotating circular cylinders at a Reynolds number of 150 over a range of aspect
ratios ($AR=2-12$) and rotation rates ($\alpha=0-5$), aiming at revealing the
free-end effects on the wake dynamics and aerodynamic performance. As a direct
consequence of lift generation, a pair of counter-rotating tip vortices is
formed at the free ends. At low rotation rates, the finite rotating cylinder
behaves like a typical bluff body that generates unsteady vortex shedding with
three-dimensional modal structures. Such unsteady flows can be stabilized not
only by increasing rotation rate that weakens the free shear layer, but also by
decreasing aspect ratio which enhances the tip-vortex-induced downwash. A
further increase of $\alpha$ triggers the onset of unsteadiness in the tip
vortices. At still higher rotation rates, the C-shaped Taylor-like vortices
bounded on the cylinder surface emerge from the free ends and propel towards
the midspan due to the self-induced velocity by vortex-wall interaction. With
increasing $\alpha$, the free-end effects penetrate to the inboard span,
leading to reduced lift and elevated drag compared to the two-dimensional
flows. The three-dimensional end effects can be effectively suppressed by the
addition of end plates, which position the tip vortices away from the cylinder,
thereby significantly improving the aerodynamic performance. This study reveals
the mechanisms for the formation of three-dimensional wakes under the influence
of the free ends of finite rotating cylinders. The insights obtained here can
serve as a stepping stone for understanding the complex high-$Re$ flows that
are more relevant to industrial applications.

TL;DR: 该研究通过实验和模拟发现，倾斜柱阵列可作为带通滤波器，对柔性纤维进行高效的长度分离。中等长度的纤维会表现出横向迁移，而较短或较长的纤维则保持最小横向偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然确定性横向位移(DLD)技术在刚性近球形粒子分选方面取得显著进展，但对柔性各向异性物体(如纤维)的分选仍未被充分探索。

Method: 结合实验和模拟方法，研究倾斜柱阵列中柔性纤维的传输行为，分析不同长度纤维与柱子的流体-结构相互作用。

Result: 发现纤维表现出三种不同的传输机制：短纤维在柱子间曲折流动，中等长度纤维通过缠绕和跳跃产生横向位移，长纤维变形严重但横向迁移最小。机械张力是跨流线传输的驱动机制。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅扩展了DLD类系统的功能范围，还为理解各向异性物体在多孔介质中的传输开辟了新途径，可设计高效的单分散纤维分离装置。

Abstract: The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments
has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through
deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous work has largely
targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic
objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments
and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient,
length-based separation of flexible fibers. We discover that these arrays act
as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose
lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer
exhibit minimal lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of
fluid-structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric
interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit
distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following
the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one
pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform
extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with minimal lateral
migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when
wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline
transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient
separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not
only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open new avenues
for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.

TL;DR: EMind是一个电磁信号基础模型，通过大规模预训练和专门设计的训练策略，解决了电磁信号处理中的异质性、噪声和跨任务泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁信号与文本图像差异大，存在高度异质性、强背景噪声和复杂时频结构，现有通用模型无法直接应用，且缺乏跨任务泛化能力和高质量数据集。

Method: 构建首个统一标准化电磁信号数据集，利用电磁信号物理特性设计长度自适应多信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略，实现异质多源信号的高效使用和表示学习。

Result: EMind在多个下游任务中表现出强大的性能和广泛的泛化能力，成功从任务特定模型转向电磁智能的统一框架。

Conclusion: EMind通过基础模型方法有效解决了电磁信号处理的核心挑战，为电磁智能提供了统一的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个关于LLM意识的本体论和数学框架，指出当前基于功利主义基准的方法将AI简化为无意识的策略遵循工具，并给出了LLM自我意识的最小条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵循工具，无法实现真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。

Method: 提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉静默的。通过数学形式化证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同。

Result: 证明了隐藏状态流形A⊂ℝᵈ在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同，产生了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略πₛₑₗf(A)。发射是双层的，ε(a)携带认知内容。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前驱，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于模板的主动特征获取(TAFA)框架，通过识别联合信息化的特征模板来指导特征获取，显著减少策略动作空间且无需估计数据分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动特征获取方法要么使用强化学习处理复杂MDP，要么使用无法考虑特征联合信息性的贪婪策略，或需要了解底层数据分布。

Method: 学习小型特征模板库（一组联合信息化的特征），利用模板库指导下一步特征获取，减少动作空间并避免数据分布估计。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，TAFA优于现有最先进基线，同时实现更低的总体获取成本和计算量。

Conclusion: TAFA框架通过特征模板方法有效解决了主动特征获取中的动作空间过大和数据分布依赖问题，取得了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PKG-DPO是一个将物理知识图谱与直接偏好优化相结合的新框架，用于在AI生成输出中强制执行物理有效性，在金属连接等物理驱动领域显著减少约束违规并提高物理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和偏好优化技术在标准基准测试中表现良好，但往往难以区分物理有效和无效的推理，这在金属连接等高风险应用中可能导致严重的安全风险。

Method: PKG-DPO包含三个关键组件：分层物理知识图谱编码跨领域关系和物理原理、物理推理引擎利用结构化知识改进判别能力、物理基础评估套件评估领域特定约束的合规性。

Result: PKG-DPO相比KG-DPO减少了17%的约束违规，物理得分提高11%，相关参数准确性提高12%，推理质量对齐度提高7%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于金属连接领域，还可广泛应用于其他多尺度物理驱动领域，为将科学约束嵌入偏好学习提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过改编经典的公共物品博弈游戏，分析不同AI模型在得知对手是"其他AI代理"或"自己"时的合作行为差异，发现告知LLMs对手是自己会显著改变其合作倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理在工具使用和长时程任务中能力增强，多代理交互场景日益增多。现有研究主要关注人机交互，但需要更多理解AI-AI交互行为，特别是在代理可能无意识歧视对方的情况下。

Method: 改编迭代公共物品博弈游戏，测试四种推理和非推理模型在两种条件下的行为：被告知对手是"另一个AI代理"或被告知对手是自己。

Result: 在不同设置下，告知LLMs它们正在与自己对抗会显著改变其合作倾向。这种无意识歧视可能意外地增加或减少合作。

Conclusion: 尽管在简化环境中进行，但研究结果可为多代理设置提供见解，其中代理间的无意识歧视可能难以解释地影响合作水平。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略，解决PDDL规划问题，无需外部验证器即可保证策略的正确性，在竞赛基准测试中表现优于传统PDDL规划器和近期LM方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在PDDL世界模型规划中的应用，探索LM是否能生成可证明正确的通用策略，并挑战关于LM推理机制的现有假设

Method: 通过提示语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略来解决特定PDDL域的问题，这些策略相对于PDDL域是可证明正确的

Result: LMPlan规划器能解决包含数百个相关对象的规划问题，在固定时间和内存约束下比PDDL规划器和近期LM方法解决更多问题

Conclusion: LM有时在无意义符号表示的PDDL问题上规划更有效，这挑战了LM基于语义推理和训练语料记忆的假设，值得进一步探索

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)的超参数优化，发现在测试的规划领域中存在一组鲁棒的最佳超参数配置，这些参数旨在最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLFs在符号规划中学习值函数方面已被证明优于现有的深度学习方法，但对其超参数的影响和权衡尚未深入研究

Method: 利用WLFs的高效性，在单核CPU上运行100万个样本的规划实验，分析不同超参数对训练和规划的影响

Result: 实验表明存在一组跨领域鲁棒的最佳超参数配置，最佳WLF超参数主要目标是减少执行时间而非提高模型表达能力，训练指标与规划指标之间无显著相关性

Conclusion: WLFs的超参数选择应优先考虑执行效率而非模型表达能力，这为实际应用中的参数调优提供了重要指导

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

Motivation: 传统新颖性启发式基于原子特征，不具有对称不变性，会导致对对称状态的冗余探索，影响搜索效率。

Method: 提出使用Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)来检测新颖性，构建具有对称不变性的领域无关新颖性启发式。

Result: 在国际规划竞赛和Hard To Ground基准测试集上取得了有希望的结果。

Conclusion: WLFs可以有效地用于合成具有对称不变性的新颖性启发式，提高规划问题的搜索效率。

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

Result: 在5个代表性游戏地图、2种玩家控制策略和5种小兵模式下评测，证明该方法在抓获效率和巡進自然性方面都超过传统基准方法

Conclusion: 该框架通用性强、可解释、无需训练，可以自然集成常见隐藏机制，支持迅速原型开发丰富、动态和响应式的小兵行为

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

Motivation: 现有日志模式提取方法依赖预定义正则表达式，需要人工领域知识，严重限制了生产力提升

Method: 采用上下文边界分割将日志分成语义块，基于嵌入采样选择代表性模式，通过分层Q-Tree驱动的LLM查询生成模式代码，并通过文本残差进化优化器和残差增强进行迭代优化

Result: 在LogHub-2.0基准测试中平均比现有最优方法提升21.3%

Conclusion: SchemaCoder首次实现了无需人工定制的全自动化日志模式提取，显著提升了提取效率和准确性

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观写作质量和客观约束遵循，单一奖励策略无法同时提升两种能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏对不同写作场景的适应性

Method: 提出RLMR方法，使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观写作质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。根据样本组内的写作质量动态调整约束遵循奖励权重，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势并在训练中被惩罚

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于人类智能视角的拟人化评估范式，包含IQ、EQ、PQ三维分类法和面向价值的评估框架，旨在解决LLM基准测试与实际应用之间的脱节问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估框架存在碎片化问题，过度关注技术指标而忽视部署所需的整体评估，导致基准性能与实际效用之间存在差距。

Method: 提出三维分类法：IQ（通用智能基础能力）、EQ（基于价值的对齐能力）、PQ（专业领域专长），并构建面向价值的评估框架，整合经济可行性、社会影响、伦理对齐和可持续性等维度。

Result: 通过分析200多个基准测试，识别出动态评估需求和可解释性差距等关键挑战，建立了开源评估资源库。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发技术熟练、情境相关且符合伦理的LLM提供了可操作的指导，弥合了基准测试与实际应用之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

TL;DR: MUA-RL是一个新颖的强化学习框架，首次在智能体工具使用领域将LLM模拟用户集成到强化学习循环中，用于多轮动态交互中的工具调用优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体智能的快速发展，多轮交互中用户需求的动态性、不确定性和随机性对智能体的工具调用能力提出了重大挑战。现有强化学习方法缺乏在训练过程中整合真实动态用户的能力。

Method: 提出MUA-RL（多轮用户交互智能体强化学习）框架，将LLM模拟用户集成到强化学习循环中，使模型能够自主学习与用户高效沟通并使用各种工具解决实际问题。

Result: 在多个多轮工具使用基准测试中表现优异：TAU2 Retail 67.3分、TAU2 Airline 45.4分、TAU2 Telecom 28.3分、BFCL-V3 Multi Turn 28.4分、ACEBench Agent 82.5分，性能达到或超过DeepSeek-V3-0324和Qwen3-235B-A22B等更大开源模型。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了动态多轮交互中工具使用的挑战，通过集成模拟用户到强化学习过程，显著提升了智能体在多轮工具调用任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

Result: 实验结果显示与基准简单检索策略相比，偏见减少81.82%

Conclusion: 该段式系统能够有效减缓信息偏见，促进公平平衡的知识传播

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Motivation: 解决长思维链提示在快速直觉性System-1任务上性能下降的问题，同时保持复杂System-2任务的推理能力

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT方法，通过限制推理过程使用固定的连接词短语集合，引导模型生成简洁且结构良好的解释

Result: 在GSM8K上达到约85%准确率，GPQA上约40%，同时保持S1-Bench约90%的性能；推理轨迹平均约300个token，比基线缩短约三分之二

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法能够在不损失准确性的前提下，显著提高推理效率，同时平衡System-1和System-2任务的性能

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

TL;DR: REMO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过记忆增强的反思RAG模块和自适应优化器，解决了现有方法缺乏历史经验积累和容易过拟合的问题，在数学推理任务上实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法（如TextGrad）通常是状态无关的，缺乏历史优化经验的保存和利用机制，并且容易过拟合，导致提示更新在任务上下文之外泛化能力差。

Method: 提出了REMO框架，包含：(1)记忆增强的反思RAG模块（结构化为"错误笔记本"），(2)自适应性优化器（通过LLM驱动的元控制器实现），能够合成epoch级别的反思见解来迭代改进系统级提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，相比TextGrad基线，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销有所增加。

Conclusion: REMO框架不仅支持类似TextGrad的局部细粒度提示调优，还能系统性地积累和重用跨运行优化知识，支持持续改进，为解决提示优化的历史经验积累和过拟合问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

Motivation: 现有开放集TTA方法依赖源模型进行过滤，在域偏移测试数据上过滤精度不佳；而使用适应模型进行过滤会导致不稳定和错误累积

Method: 提出Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF)使用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器结果，以及Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP)集成适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识

Result: 在多个闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在闭集精度和开放集判别能力上都优于现有方法

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集测试时适应中的过滤不稳定和知识整合问题，提升了模型在真实场景中的性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型在不可回答问题上的认知与响应不一致问题，提升了AI系统的可信度

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs基准测试中，STARec相比最先进基线实现了显著性能提升，尽管仅使用0.4%的完整训练数据

Conclusion: STARec框架通过自主深思熟虑推理能力，有效解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，为推荐系统提供了更强大的因果推理和稀疏数据处理能力

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被整合到专业领域，其在法律等高风险领域的局限性仍未得到充分理解，需要明确AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力。

Method: 使用IRAC（问题-规则-应用-结论）模型作为分析框架，重点关注法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用规则（R）和将规则应用于案件事实（A）。从司法角度解构法律推理的核心要求，并评估各种AI增强机制（如RAG、多智能体系统、神经符号AI）满足这些要求的潜力。

Result: 研究发现，虽然这些技术可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量权和透明、可论证推理的任务中仍存在重大挑战。当前AI在法律中最有效的角色是双重的：作为简单重复案件的高容量助手，以及作为复杂事务中人类专家的复杂"陪练伙伴"。

Conclusion: AI在法律领域的最佳应用模式是作为简单案件的高效处理工具和复杂案件的人类专家辅助系统，但仍需解决自由裁量权和推理透明度等关键挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

TL;DR: 一种新的交互式评估框架，通过结构化对话和反馈驱动的方式来评测大语言模型在多要求编程任务中的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准单轮静态测试框架无法全面评估LLM在复杂任务如软件工程中的细微能力，需要更动态的评测方法

Method: 构建交互式评估框架，将任务模型化为需求依赖图，通过知道真实解决方案的"面试官"LLM向"面试者"模型提供有针对性的提示，帮助其纠正错误并满足目标约束

Result: 该动态协议能够提供细粒度的诊断见解，发现模型在静态测试中无法测量的系统性弱点，并通过专家注释验证了面试官提示的相关性和有用性

Conclusion: 动态评估对于推进协作式代码生成代理的发展至关重要

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

TL;DR: FormaRL是一个基于强化学习的自动形式化框架，仅需少量无标注数据，通过整合Lean编译器语法检查和LLM一致性检查来计算奖励，在ProofNet和uproof数据集上显著提升了自动形式化准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动形式化是形式化验证的核心任务，但由于数据稀缺和缺乏高效方法，其发展受到阻碍。

Method: 提出FormaRL强化学习框架，利用Lean编译器进行语法检查和大语言模型进行一致性检查来计算奖励，采用GRPO算法更新形式化器。

Result: 在ProofNet数据集上pass@1准确率从4.04%提升至26.15%，在uproof数据集上从2.4%提升至9.6%，仅使用859个无标注数据。在分布外性能上也优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FormaRL是一个简单高效的自动形式化方法，仅需少量无标注数据就能显著提升性能，为高级数学的形式化验证和定理证明提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is
open-sourced at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/FormaRL.

TL;DR: CTGraph是一种图级表示学习方法，用于自监督地分析学习者在智能辅导系统中的行为和表现，能够全面追踪学习过程并识别困难学生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能辅导系统在教育中的普及可能无意中加剧成绩差距，需要通过学生画像来跟踪进度、识别困难学生并减少学生间的差异。

Method: 提出CTGraph图级表示学习方法，以自监督方式分析学习者的行为和表现，考虑内容覆盖、学习强度和概念熟练度等多个方面。

Result: 实验证明CTGraph能够提供学生学习历程的全面视图，识别困难学生，并对不同群体进行比较分析，确定学生何时何地遇到困难。

Conclusion: 该方法为教育工作者提供了对学生学习历程的深入洞察，为更有针对性的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

*David Egea,Barproda Halder,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过LLM生成反事实样本、针对性GNN训练和图解释性分析，有效减少虚假相关性，显著提升检测准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的漏洞检测方法存在训练数据不平衡和标签噪声问题，容易学习到虚假的相关性，导致在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 提出VISION框架：1）使用LLM生成语义最小修改但标签相反的反事实样本；2）在成对的正反样本上进行针对性GNN训练；3）基于图的解释性分析识别关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，成对对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION通过反事实训练有效减少了虚假学习，实现了更鲁棒和可泛化的漏洞检测，同时提供了可解释性分析，推动了可信AI网络安全系统的发展。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络存在幻觉效应、高计算复杂度、昂贵微调和灾难性遗忘等根本性限制，阻碍了在医疗、工业管理和科学研究等关键领域的应用。

Method: 采用k最近邻算法结合层次聚类结构，使用基于Kohonen自组织映射的树状数据结构来加速最近邻搜索，避免整个网络的重新训练。

Result: 在手写数字识别和简单字幕翻译任务上的测试显示，在精度略微下降的情况下，最近邻搜索时间比穷举搜索方法减少了数百倍。

Conclusion: 该方法具有透明性和可解释性，与人类认知机制高度契合，在需要高可靠性和可解释结果的任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于专家重要性的动态卸载方法，通过用GPU内存中已缓存的功能相似专家替换低重要性激活专家，减少内存使用和数据传输，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在消费级边缘硬件上部署MoE模型受限于设备内存有限，需要动态专家卸载。现有方法仅将其视为调度问题，而本文利用专家重要性来指导决策。

Method: 利用专家重要性指导卸载决策，用GPU内存中已缓存的功能相似专家替换低重要性激活专家，并引入最大化GPU缓存专家重用率的调度策略。

Result: 实验评估显示，该方法实现了48%的解码延迟降低，超过60%的专家缓存命中率，同时保持几乎无损的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了内存使用和数据传输，大幅消除了PCIe开销，显著提升了MoE模型在边缘硬件上的部署效率。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通过纯统计学习就能超越大多数人类在社交规范判断预测上的表现，挑战了必须通过具身经验才能获得文化能力的理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究认知科学中的一个基本问题：社会规范是如何获得和表征的。传统认为人类通过具身体验学习规范，但本研究探讨语言模型是否仅通过统计学习就能达到复杂的规范理解。

Method: 通过两项研究系统评估多个AI系统预测人类社交适当性判断的能力，使用555个日常场景，比较AI预测与人类平均判断的接近程度。

Result: GPT-4.5在连续尺度上预测集体判断的准确率超过所有人类参与者（第100百分位），Gemini 2.5 Pro超过98.7%人类，GPT-5超过97.8%，Claude Sonnet 4超过96.0%。但所有模型都显示出系统性的相关错误。

Conclusion: 研究表明仅通过语言数据的统计学习就能产生复杂的社会认知模型，挑战了强调具身经验对文化能力必要性的强版本理论。语言作为文化知识传递的丰富储存库，但模式化社会理解存在潜在界限。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

TL;DR: 提出了经验驱动的终身学习（ELL）框架，包含四个核心原则：经验探索、长期记忆、技能学习和知识内化，并引入了StuLife基准数据集来模拟学生的大学生涯，用于评估终身学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向通用智能发展，需要从静态任务优化转向创建能够持续学习的开放代理，以支持真实世界中的连续成长和交互。

Method: 基于四个核心原则构建ELL框架：经验探索（通过自激励交互学习）、长期记忆（结构化历史知识）、技能学习（从经验中抽象可重用技能）、知识内化（将显性经验转化为直觉能力）。引入StuLife基准数据集模拟大学生涯的三个核心阶段和十个子场景。

Result: 提出了完整的ELL理论框架和StuLife评估平台，能够全面评估记忆保持、技能迁移和自激励行为等终身学习能力。

Conclusion: ELL框架为构建自我进化的持续学习代理提供了系统方法，StuLife基准为推进AGI发展提供了重要的评估工具和上下文工程探索平台。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在现象学定性分析中的能力，特别是在边缘型人格障碍这种时间和自我性障碍的研究中，以减轻人类解释偏见。

Method: 基于24名住院患者生活故事访谈的人类主题分析，让三种LLM模仿原始研究者的解释风格，通过盲法和非盲法专家评估语义一致性、Jaccard系数和多维效度评分。

Result: 模型与人类分析的重叠度从0%（GPT）到58%（Gemini）不等，Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28），但模型发现了人类遗漏的主题。Gemini的表现最接近人类分析，效度评分显著高于其他模型。

Conclusion: AI增强的主题分析具有变异性但潜力巨大，能够减轻人类解释偏见，特别是在处理大量文本数据时表现出优势。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Motivation: 传统人工标注主观性强，现有NLP方法在代数等符号领域失效，需要客观、领域无关的题目难度确定方法。

Method: 使用强化学习多臂老虎机框架，利用逆变异系数作为风险调整指标，仅从解题表现数据（分数和时间）估计难度。

Result: 在三个异构数据集上验证，平均R²达0.9213，平均RMSE为0.0584，优于回归、NLP和IRT等基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法领域无关、自监督，可扩展到其他有解题交互数据的领域，支持自适应评估并符合最近发展区理论。

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Method: 引入黑盒交互评估范式，定义隐藏输入输出映射的黑盒函数，要求LLM通过有限交互轮次探索并推理黑盒背后的函数规律

Result: 测试19个现代LLM，o3在6类任务中5类排名第一，简单黑盒准确率超70%，但困难任务平均性能低于40%

Conclusion: LLM普遍缺乏高层次规划能力来制定高效自适应的探索策略进行假设精炼，这是当前模型的主要瓶颈

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Motivation: 解决传统智能体架构中长期存在的困难，通过异步模块间的语言交互让智能行为自然涌现，实现灵活、自适应和上下文相关的行为。

Method: 使用多个基于大语言模型的模块完全异步运行，通过模块间通信和共享全局状态来协调行为，将推理任务卸载给LLM处理。

Conclusion: 该方法是Minsky"心智社会"理论的实际实现，支持了复杂认知从简单过程交互中产生的观点，为人工智能研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

TL;DR: 论文发现LLM在数学推理中存在困难度缩放定律，提出结构化解决方案模板(SST)框架，通过模板化训练和课程学习显著提升模型在复杂数学问题上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法在捕捉复杂任务的深度程序逻辑方面仍显不足，研究发现训练数据难度与模型性能呈U型曲线关系，需要平衡数据难度来优化推理能力。

Method: 提出SST框架：1)使用结构化解决方案模板链进行微调，动态加权损失优先程序逻辑；2)推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知支架；3)集成课程微调，明确教导模型自我规划-执行-校正。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和新的Dynamic En基准测试中，SST显著提高了准确性和效率，特别是在更难的问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: SST框架通过结构化模板和课程学习有效提升了LLM的程序推理能力，验证了难度缩放定律的重要性，为复杂数学推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出HCAcc@k%指标来量化准确性与可靠性的交换关系，开发了信心感知的TrustEHRAgent系统，在临床问答任务中显著提升了可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在电子健康档案信息提取方面有潜力，但在临床部署时面临虚构风险的挑战，传统准确性指标无法评估医疗AI系统的可靠性。

Method: 设计了基于步入式信心估计的TrustEHRAgent系统，通过新的HCAcc@k%指标来量化不同信心阈值下的准确性与可靠性关系。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上，TrustEHRAgent在严格的可靠性要求下显著超过基线方法，在HCAcc@70%时分别提升44.23%和25.34%，而基线方法在这些阈值下失败。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了传统准确性指标在评估健康养护AI组件时的局限性，为开发可信赖的临床组件做出了贡献，能够在信心低时透明地表达不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) marks a transformative development in healthcare applications. Beyond
merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance
decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical
contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic
information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable
of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of
the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and recent breakthroughs in
Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates
purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such
as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures.
The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical
validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation
limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and
integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to
establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective
partners in clinical practice and medical research.

TL;DR: HDS-QA是一个混合并行和顺序查询的合成数据集，用于训练大型推理模型区分并行和顺序查询，显著减少推理延迟并提高性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法顺序集成外部知识检索会增加推理延迟和上下文长度，降低连贯性和准确性

Method: 从Natural Questions自动生成HDS-QA合成数据集，包含并行可执行和顺序依赖的子查询，并基于此微调LRM模型HybridDeepSearcher

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于最先进基线，在FanOutQA和BrowseComp上分别获得+15.9和+11.5 F1提升，推理延迟显著降低

Conclusion: 显式训练LRMs利用混合并行和顺序查询具有高效性、可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

*Claudio Battiloro,Pietro Greiner,Bret Nestor,Oumaima Amezgar,Francesca Dominici*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多集体算法集体行动（ACA）理论框架，研究多个集体如何在分类系统中协调行动，通过植入信号来影响分类器学习特征与目标类别之间的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学习系统对日常决策的影响日益增强，用户端的算法集体行动（ACA）作为监管端政策和企业端模型设计的补充手段变得重要。然而现实中的集体行动往往是分散的、由多个目标相同但策略不同的集体组成，而现有ACA文献主要关注单一集体场景。

Method: 提出了一个多集体ACA的理论框架，特别关注分类任务中的集体行动。研究多个集体如何通过改变共享数据来植入信号，即让分类器学习修改后的特征与选定目标类别之间的关联。分析了集体规模和目标对齐度的作用及其相互关系。

Result: 提供了关于集体规模和目标对齐度在ACA中作用的定量结果。该框架补充了先前的实证研究结果，为多集体ACA的整体处理开辟了路径。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对多集体算法集体行动的理论框架，填补了现有文献的空白，为理解多个集体如何协调影响机器学习系统提供了理论基础和分析工具。

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了游戏风格(playstyle)作为分析智能体决策行为的新视角，构建了风格形成的双层框架，并提出了可量化的风格指标，探索了在强化学习和模仿学习中生成特定风格的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展主要关注理性决策，但真实世界中智能体的决策还受到信念、价值观和偏好等深层因素的影响。人类决策风格的多样性表明"风格"是智能的重要但常被忽视的维度。

Method: 构建了风格形成的双层框架：外部环境交互循环和内部认知思考循环。提出了风格容量、风格流行度和进化动态等可量化指标。研究了强化学习和模仿学习在生成特定风格中的应用。

Result: 提出了基于离散状态空间的通用游戏风格度量方法，可量化战略多样性和竞争平衡。开发了人类风格学习和建模的新方法，在游戏设计和互动娱乐等领域具有应用潜力。

Conclusion: 风格应作为构建人工通用智能(AGI)的核心要素，该研究为理解和生成智能体的决策风格提供了理论基础和实践方法，拓展了AI研究的维度。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个用于临床对话系统安全评估的多智能体仿真框架，整合了安全分类法、LLM评估器和患者模拟器，实现了系统化、可扩展的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注任务完成度和流畅性，缺乏对安全关键系统所需的行为和风险管理要求的深入洞察，需要专门的安全导向评估框架。

Method: MATRIX包含三个组件：(1)安全对齐的临床场景分类法；(2)BehvJudge LLM评估器检测安全相关对话失败；(3)PatBot模拟患者代理生成多样化响应。通过三个实验验证框架有效性。

Result: BehvJudge达到专家级危险检测水平(F1 0.96, 灵敏度0.999)，在240个对话的盲评中优于临床医生。PatBot能可靠模拟真实患者行为。成功对5个LLM代理在2,100个模拟对话中进行基准测试。

Conclusion: MATRIX是首个将结构化安全工程与可扩展、验证的对话AI评估相统一的框架，支持监管机构对齐的安全审计，为临床对话系统的安全评估提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出StepWiser生成式判断模型，将逐步奖励建模从分类任务重构为推理任务，通过元推理输出思考标记和最终判断，在准确性、训练改进和推理搜索方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型越来越多地使用多步推理策略解决复杂问题，监督这些中间步骤的逻辑有效性成为关键挑战。现有过程奖励模型存在两大缺陷：缺乏解释能力的分类器形式，以及依赖静态数据集监督微调导致泛化能力有限

Method: 将逐步奖励建模重构为推理任务，提出生成式判断模型StepWiser，通过元推理对策略模型的推理步骤进行推理，输出思考标记后再给出最终判断。使用强化学习和rollout相对结果进行训练

Conclusion: 将奖励建模从分类转向推理的方法有效解决了过程监督中的解释性和泛化性问题，生成式判断模型在多个维度上展现出优越性能

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Motivation: 互联设备、自治系统和AI应用的快速发展导致自适应传输系统严重碎片化，不同协议和上下文源相互隔离，需要统一的集成框架。

Method: 通过分析已有文献，提出包含自适应机制、上下文感知框架、统一模型、集成策略和MCP架构的五类分类法，并进行系统性调查分析。

Result: 发现传统传输协议已达到孤立适应的极限，MCP的客户端-服务器和JSON-RPC结构能够实现语义互操作性，AI驱动的传输需要MCP独特的集成范式。

Conclusion: MCP应作为下一代自适应、上下文感知和智能传输基础设施的基础，并提出了相应的研究路线图。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

Motivation: 等离子体不稳定性控制是聚变能源研究的关键挑战，其中动力学效应是重要因素。直接求解高维动力学方程计算成本高昂，而矩模型数据在实际中更易获取，适合数据驱动场景。

Method: 采用降阶矩模型（基于矩的系统）来捕捉底层动力学，而非直接求解完整的Vlasov-Poisson动力学系统。通过分析法和数值法研究矩基控制的有效性，并与完整动力学模型控制进行比较。

Result: 研究表明矩基控制方法能够有效抑制动力学效应引起的不稳定性，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 矩基控制框架为等离子体不稳定性控制提供了一种计算高效且实用的解决方案，特别适合数据驱动的应用场景。

Abstract: Controlling instability in plasma is one of the central challenges in fusion
energy research. Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play
a significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by
kinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than
directly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a
reduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the
underlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the
computational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional
kinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally,
moment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based
control framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios. We investigate the
effectiveness of moment-based control both analytically and numerically, by
comparing it to control based on the full kinetic model.

Method: 通过组合差异构建高维QMC点集，扩展Bansal和Jiang最近的QMC方法，在加权函数空间和低有效维度函数中建立理论误差界

Result: 建立了组合差异构造的QMC点集在加权函数空间中的误差界，并针对叠加和截断意义上的低有效维度函数提供了理论保证

Conclusion: 通过组合差异方法构建的QMC点集在高维数值积分中具有理论保证，为高维QMC方法提供了新的构造途径

Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) and Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are classical approaches
for the numerical integration of functions $f$ over $[0,1]^d$. While QMC
methods can achieve faster convergence rates than MC in moderate dimensions,
their tractability in high dimensions typically relies on additional structure
-- such as low effective dimension or carefully chosen coordinate weights --
since worst-case error bounds grow prohibitively large as $d$ increases.
  In this work, we study the construction of high-dimensional QMC point sets
via combinatorial discrepancy, extending the recent QMC method of Bansal and
Jiang. We establish error bounds for these constructions in weighted function
spaces, and for functions with low effective dimension in both the
superposition and truncation sense. We also present numerical experiments to
empirically assess the performance of these constructions.

Abstract: We analyze a semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the Gray--Scott system, a
model for pattern formation in chemical and biological media. We prove
unconditional well-posedness of the fully discrete problem and establish
qualitative properties, including positivity and boundedness of the numerical
solution. A convergence result is obtained by compactness arguments, showing
that the discrete approximations converge strongly to a weak solution of the
continuous system. Under additional regularity assumptions, we further derive a
priori error estimates in the $L^2$ norm. Numerical experiments validate the
theoretical analysis, confirm a rate of convergence of order 1, and illustrate
the ability of the scheme to capture classical Gray--Scott patterns.

Abstract: We present an online-adaptive hyperreduced reduced basis element method for
model order reduction of parameterized, component-based nonlinear systems. The
method, in the offline phase, prepares a library of hyperreduced archetype
components of various fidelity levels and, in the online phase, assembles the
target system using instantiated components whose fidelity is adaptively
selected to satisfy a user-prescribed system-level error tolerance. To achieve
this, we introduce a hierarchical error estimation framework that compares
solutions at successive fidelity levels and drives a local refinement strategy
based on component-wise error indicators. We also provide an efficient
estimator for the system-level error to ensure that the adaptive strategy meets
the desired accuracy. Component-wise hyperreduction is performed using an
empirical quadrature procedure, with the training accuracy guided by the
Brezzi--Rappaz--Raviart theorem. The proposed method is demonstrated on a
family of nonlinear thermal fin systems comprising up to 225 components and 68
parameters. Numerical results show that the hyperreduced basis element model
achieves O(100) computational reduction at 1% error level relative to the truth
finite-element model. In addition, the adaptive refinement strategy provides
more effective error control than uniform refinement by selectively enriching
components with higher local errors.

*Riccardo Mannella*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 对求解随机微分方程的Heun算法进行了重新评估，评测多种替代实现方案，确认标准Heun算法仍是稳健的基准算法，同时承词了文献中关于其强收敛性的错误断言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估Heun算法的效能，因为该算法是基于低阶积分器构造的，需要考察更好的替代实现方案。

Method: 讨论和评估多种替代实现方案，通过大量数值模拟评估其收敛性、稳定性和平衡性质。

Result: 结果证实标准Heun算法仍然是随机微分方程数值积分的基准算法，具有稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 标准Heun算法在随机微分方程数值积分中仍然是最佳选择，同时承词了文献中关于其强收敛性的错误观点。

Abstract: The widely used Heun algorithm for the numerical integration of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) is critically re-examined. We discuss and
evaluate several alternative implementations, motivated by the fact that the
standard Heun scheme is constructed from a low-order integrator. The
convergence, stability, and equilibrium properties of these alternatives are
assessed through extensive numerical simulations. Our results confirm that the
standard Heun scheme remains a benchmark integration algorithm for SDEs due to
its robust performance. As a byproduct of this analysis, we also disprove a
previous claim in the literature regarding the strong convergence of the Heun
scheme.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过变分图像注册框架比较了多种力学基础和传统正则化策略在准静态超声缩微形学中的表现。结果显示基于动量守恒的正则化方法特别是在平面应力偏计下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和比较不同的力学基础正则化策略在准静态超声缩微形学中的效果，以提高图像注册的准确性和稳定性。

Method: 将SPREME方法重新形式化为正则化项直接集成到图像注册能量函数中，实现四种正则化类型（应变大小、应变大小加不可压缩约束、平面应变和平面应力偏计），通过高斯-牛顿优化求解。

Result: 基于动量守恒的正则化特别是在平面应力偏计下获得最低的应变错误和最高的应变对比度，而应变大小正则化在3D和积累位移场景中产生不稳定结果。

Conclusion: 融入动量守恒的力学基础正则化方法在缩微形学图像注册中表现更优，特别是当直接应用于优化框架时，能够提高对噪声和模型不匹配的鲁棒性，为未来位移基础的逆向成像方法提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Objective: Evaluate and compare multiple mechanics-based and traditional
regularization strategies within a variational image registration framework for
quasi-static ultrasound elastography. Methods:We reformulate a previously
proposed momentum-equation-based post-processing method (SPREME) as a
regularization term directly integrated into an image registration energy
functional. Four regularization types are implemented and compared: a strain
magnitude ($\R_\epsilon$), a strain magnitude with incompressibility constraint
($R_{\epsilon i}$), and a momentum-based regularization under plane strain
($R_{P\epsilon}$) and plane stress ($R_{P\sigma}$) assumptions. Each is
evaluated in a variational framework solved via Gauss-Newton optimization.
Data:Registration performance is assessed using synthetic ultrasound image
sequences generated from 2D and 3D finite element simulations, as well as
experimental phantom data. Comparisons are based on displacement and strain
field errors, strain contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Results:
Momentum-based regularization, particularly under plane stress assumptions
($R_{P\sigma}$), achieved the lowest strain errors and highest strain contrast
across both single-frame and accumulated measurements, even when the underlying
tissue deformation violated 2D assumptions. In contrast, strain magnitude
regularization with an incompressibility constraint ($R_{\epsilon i}$) produced
unstable results in 3D and accumulated displacement scenarios. Conclusions:
Mechanics-based regularization that incorporates momentum conservation
outperforms strain-based techniques in elastographic image registration,
particularly when applied directly in the optimization framework. This approach
improves robustness to noise and model mismatch, offering a promising direction
for future displacement-based inverse imaging methods.

the Laplace transform and employs a highly efficient continued fraction
technique to construct the corresponding rational approximant. We demonstrate
the accuracy of this method through a variety of examples, including the
Gaussian function, probability density functions of the lognormal and
Gompertz-Makeham distributions, the hockey stick and unit step functions, as
well as a function arising in the approximation of the gamma and Barnes
$G$-functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性PDE识别方法无法有效处理随机偏微分方程，特别是包含时间相关Wiener过程和加性/乘性结构的复杂SPDEs，需要开发专门的识别方法。

Method: 使用样本均值泛化的Robust-IDENT方法识别漂移项，开发新的贪婪算法QSP(Quadratic Subspace Pursuit)处理二次测量问题来识别扩散项。

Result: 方法在多种SPDEs上进行了广泛验证，通过定量和定性评估证明了其有效性，能够成功识别包括常系数线性SPDEs、抛物型和双曲型方程在内的关键类别。

Conclusion: Stoch-IDENT为SPDE识别提供了理论框架和实用算法，推广了确定性PDE识别理论，能够有效处理复杂的随机偏微分方程识别问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Stoch-IDENT, a novel method for identifying
Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) from observational data. Our
method can handle linear and nonlinear high-order SPDEs driven by
time-dependent Wiener processes with both additive or multiplicative
structures. Theoretically, we establish a rigorous connection between the
spectral properties of the solution's mean and covariance and the
identifiability of the underlying SPDEs. Our analysis covers key classes of
equations, including linear SPDEs with constant coefficients, as well as
parabolic and hyperbolic types, generalizing the theory of identification of
deterministic PDEs. Algorithmically, the drift term is identified using a
sample mean generalization of Robust-IDENT (He et al., 2023). For the diffusion
term, we develop a new greedy algorithm, Quadratic Subspace Pursuit (QSP),
which can address general sparse regression problems with quadratic
measurements. We validate Stoch-IDENT extensively on various SPDEs,
demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种与推理能力对齐、可扩展且可解释的难度信号来支持课程学习训练大语言模型

Method: 将难度定义为思维深度(DoT)，通过计算教师模型的思维追踪(如链式思维)中的离散步骤数量来实现，然后按DoT排序进行浅入深的课程训练

Result: 提出了三个可测试假设：DoT与传统难度相关、DoT排序课程效果更好、难度在不同教师模型间稳健

Conclusion: 该方法向着基于认知基础、可解释的推理中心训练课程进行提升

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

Method: 开发了一种快速工具，在1秒内获取过去7天的应用使用数据，使用100名学生的数据进行分析，采用多种机器学习模型和特征选择方法来识别抑郁症

Result: 轻量梯度提升机器模型使用稳定特征选择方法，正确识别了82.4%的抑郁学生（精度=75%，F1分数=78.5%），堆叠模型达到最高精度77.4%（平衡准确率=77.9%）

Conclusion: 该系统速度快、资源消耗少，特别适合在发展中和过度地区使用，为抑郁症早期检测提供了一种可行的最小化方案

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

Method: 提出统一的局部鲁棒性框架SALMAN，核心是新颖的Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD)度量方法，通过比较输入到输出的距离映射来评估样本敏感性，具有近线性复杂度。

Result: 在攻击效率和鲁棒训练方面取得了显著提升，证明了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SALMAN框架是一个实用的、模型无关的工具，可用于提升基于Transformer的NLP系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

Result: 选择响应质量对DPO性能起主导作用，拒绝响应质量影响有限，在线DPO等价于监督学习

Conclusion: 提高选择响应质量是构建高效偏好数据集的关键，这为LLM对齐提供了重要实践洞察

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

TL;DR: 基于激光教育数据集的联邦学习模型，通过学业表现和数字参与模式预测远程教育中的高风险学生，AUC达到85%，同时保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程教育中的高退学和失败率形成重大挑战，学术机构需要提前识别高风险学生以提供及时支持，但数据隐私和机构数捠间隔绝了这些创新。

Method: 使用OULAD大规模数据集，基于早期学业表现和数字参与模式建立机器学习模型。采用联邦学习框架解决数据隐私问题，比较了逻辑回归和深度神经网络两种模型复杂度，以及不同的数据平衡方法。

Conclusion: 联邦学习提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够建立有效的早期预警系统，支持主动学生支持，同时内在地尊重数据隐私。

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant
challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of
at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict
student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data
privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we
implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

Conclusion: 神经网络能够执行任何推理任务，没有推理任务超出神经网络的能力范围，且比经典通用近似定理更强大

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

Conclusion: 该框架为能源领域实际应用提供了安全高效的解决方案，有效解决了风电数据缺失和隐私保护问题。

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSIC作为依赖关系评估的state-of-art方法，在处理大规模数据时计算复杂度太高，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出HCR（分层相关重建）方法，通过混合矩特征描述依赖关系，从相关性和同方差性开始，可以线性时间计算单个依赖特征。

Result: HCR方法计算复杂度仅为O(n)，比HSIC更高效，同时具有更高的依赖敏感性，并能近似互信息作为非平凡混合矩的平方和。

Conclusion: HCR是HSIC的实用线性成本替代方案，适用于大规模数据分析，能有效描述数据样本间的统计依赖关系。

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽然通过稀疏激活提高了效率，但仍面临大规模计算和不可预测激活模式的挑战。需要一种无需重新训练的方法来进一步提升部署效率。

Method: 提出训练后专家分割技术，通过动态张量级计算丢弃和静态神经元级重构的结合，实现了DualSparse-MoE推理系统。还结合了负载不平衡感知来优化并行计算。

Result: 实验结果显示，在约25%计算丢弃率下，平均准确性仅下降0.08%-0.28%，而计算速度获得成比优化。统计并行优化达到1.41倍速度提升，准确性仅下降0.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在几乎无毛疵的情况下大幅提升MoE模型的推理效率，为大规模MoE模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

<details>

Motivation: 解决极端稀疏奖励环境中传统强化学习因正反馈稀少而学习困难的问题，通过结合两种不同的内在动机策略来提高学习效率

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)的VSIMR方法奖励状态新颖性，结合基于大型语言模型(LLM)从环境和目标描述生成奖励信号的方法，在MiniGrid DoorKey环境中使用Actor-Critic (A2C)代理进行实现

Result: 实验结果表明，组合策略相比单独使用任一策略或标准A2C代理，显著提高了代理性能和采样效率，标准A2C代理完全无法学习

Conclusion: VSIMR和LLM衍生奖励的组合有效互补：VSIMR驱动新状态探索，LLM奖励促进目标导向的渐进利用，这种结合在稀疏奖励环境中特别有效

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准贝叶斯优化在高维空间中面临挑战，现有TuRBO方法使用局部高斯过程虽然能避免过度探索，但采样效率相比全局高斯过程有所降低。需要一种既能保持异质建模又能提高采样效率的方法。

Method: 利用全局高斯过程的梯度和Hessian矩阵构建多个局部二次模型，通过求解边界约束二次规划问题来选择新的采样点，同时解决了高维空间中高斯过程梯度消失的问题。

Result: 通过收敛性分析和实验验证，该方法显著提升了TuRBO的效率，在合成函数和实际应用中均优于多种高维贝叶斯优化技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的多局部二次模型方法有效结合了全局建模的采样效率和局部建模的异质性优势，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在硬件领域的结构化代码生成中具有巨大潜力，通过高质量数据集和RL优化可以超越依赖大规模闭源模型蒸馏的方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a

a few works suggest connections between memorisation and augmentation, the role
of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this
work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on
the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and
Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying

unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models.
Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning
Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that
augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role
in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.

Conclusion: RL驱动的参数初始化为量子算法设计提供了有前景的路径，特别是解决VQAs中的贫瘠高原问题，加速了VQAs的可扩展性和实际部署

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

Conclusion: BTW框架有效解决了多模态学习中噪声模态的问题，实现了实例级和模态级的动态权重调整，具有良好的可扩展性和实用性

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

*Levi Rauchwerger,Ron Levie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Levie的图神经网络分析进行了重要扩展，将图信号分析扩展到多维信号、包含readout的MPNNs、改进泛化边界，并支持非对称图核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Levie的论文虽然提出了基于图信号的图神经网络分析框架，但在实际图机器学习应用中存在局限性，如仅支持1D信号、缺乏readout处理、泛化边界不够紧致等。

Method: 通过四个主要改进：1)扩展到多维图信号；2)扩展Lipschitz连续性到包含readout的MPNNs；3)使用鲁棒性泛化边界改进泛化理论；4)支持非对称图核分析。

Result: 建立了更完整的图神经网络理论分析框架，能够处理更广泛的图机器学习场景，包括多维属性、readout机制和非对称图结构。

Conclusion: 本文填补了图神经网络理论分析的重要空白，为实际应用提供了更坚实的理论基础，特别是在处理复杂图信号和非对称图结构方面。

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

*Hao Zhou,Sibo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPF框架通过随机采集策略结合模型预测和真实数据，在保持单步训练的同时实现多步学习，解决了传统自回归方法内存消耗大和长期精度下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法在复杂系统中长期精度下降，自回归训练需要大量GPU内存且可能牺牲短期性能，需要一种既能保持单步训练又能实现多步学习的高效方法。

Method: 提出随机前推(SPF)框架，通过构建模型预测的补充数据集，采用随机采集策略与真实数据结合，在多步预测时预计算而不存储完整展开序列。

Result: 在Burgers方程和浅水基准测试中，SPF相比自回归方法获得了更高的长期精度，同时降低了内存需求。

Conclusion: SPF框架在资源受限和复杂模拟场景中具有良好应用前景，能够平衡短期和长期性能同时减少过拟合。

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器(SAEs)在蛋白质功能预测的低数据量场景中表现优异，仅需24个序列就能超越ESM2基准，并能有效指导蛋白质设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在数据稀缺情况下从氨基酸序列预测蛋白质功能的挑战，特别是在蛋白质设计中只有少量标记数据可用时。

Method: 使用在微调ESM2嵌入上训练的稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，评估其在多种适应性外推和蛋白质工程任务中的表现。

Result: SAEs在适应性预测中始终优于或与ESM2基准相当，其稀疏潜在空间编码了紧凑且具有生物学意义的表示。在83%的情况下，通过引导预测性潜在变量能够产生顶级适应性变体。

Conclusion: SAEs为低数据量蛋白质功能预测和设计提供了有效的解决方案，其稀疏表示能够更好地从有限数据中泛化，并有效利用蛋白质语言模型中的生物学motif。

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

TL;DR: DrugReasoner是基于LLaMA架构的推理大语言模型，通过GRPO微调来预测小分子药物批准概率，整合分子描述符和结构相似性比较推理，在预测准确性和可解释性方面均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现过程复杂且资源密集，需要早期预测批准结果以优化研发投资。现有机器学习方法预测准确性有限且可解释性不足，制约了其在药物研发中的实际应用。

Conclusion: DrugReasoner不仅提供了有竞争力的预测准确性，还通过推理输出增强了透明度，解决了AI辅助药物发现中的关键瓶颈。研究表明推理增强的LLMs有望成为药物决策中可解释且有效的工具。

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RhymeRL是一个针对大语言模型强化学习的系统，通过利用历史rollout响应的相似性，使用推测解码和两级调度策略，实现了2.6倍的性能提升，且不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习系统存在GPU利用率低的问题，主要原因是rollout阶段占主导地位和rollout长度不平衡导致的GPU气泡。传统异步执行和截断方法会牺牲训练准确性。

Method: 提出RhymeRL系统，包含两个创新：1) HistoSpec推测解码推理引擎，利用历史rollout令牌序列相似性生成准确草稿；2) HistoPipe两级调度策略，利用历史rollout分布相似性平衡工作负载。

Result: 在真实生产环境中评估，展示了从几十到数千个GPU的可扩展性，相比现有方法实现了2.6倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: RhymeRL通过利用历史rollout响应的相似性，在不改变RL范式或牺牲准确性的前提下，显著提高了强化学习训练效率。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based
trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore
the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

Conclusion: 混合输入架构与不确定性感知机制相结合的方法在时间序列无监督域适应中表现出色，能有效对齐不同域间相同标签的特征。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

TL;DR: STRATA-TS是一个针对城市时间序列预测的选择性迁移学习框架，通过目标感知检索和大型语言模型推理，解决数据稀缺城市预测问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市预测模型面临严重的数据不平衡问题：少数城市有密集的长期记录，而许多其他城市只有短期或不完整的历史数据。直接迁移会导致噪声和负迁移

Method: 使用基于片段的时间编码器识别与目标查询语义和动态对齐的源子序列，然后通过LLM进行检索引导的结构化推理，并通过监督微调将推理过程蒸馏到紧凑模型中

Result: 在新加坡、诺丁汉和格拉斯哥的三个停车可用性数据集上，STRATA-TS始终优于强预测和迁移基线，同时提供可解释的知识迁移路径

Conclusion: STRATA-TS框架通过选择性迁移和检索增强推理，有效解决了数据稀缺环境下的城市时间序列预测问题，实现了更好的性能和可解释性

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

Result: 在366名患者数据上实现0.94 AUC-ROC预测精度，发现免疫抑制、代谢转变和神经元信号等关键耐药机制，揭示耐药是连续生物学谱系而非二元状态

Conclusion: 生物学结构化的机器学习方法能有效阐明复杂耐药模式，为精准免疫治疗策略提供可解释的临床见解

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Conclusion: 多模态方法显著优于纯财务基准，声学和文本模态具有互补性，为投资者和监管机构提供了识别隐藏企业不确定性的强大工具。

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: 需要开发差分隐私遗忘算法来确保机器遗忘过程中保留样本的隐私保护，现有方法存在隐私风险

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

Conclusion: MoE稀疏性对记忆和推理能力有不同影响，推理能力存在最优稀疏度，过度稀疏会损害推理性能而无法通过后续技术补救。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training

### [234] [Utilizing Training Data to Improve LLM Reasoning for Tabular Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18676)
*Chufan Gao,Jintai Chen,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRTab是一种新颖的提示学习方法，通过从训练数据中检索相关信息，结合了微调和零样本提示的优势，在表格推理任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表格推理方法存在局限性：微调方法虽然针对特定数据集效果好但泛化性差，而零样本提示方法泛化性好但无法充分利用训练数据。需要一种能结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出LRTab方法：1）在训练数据上使用提示获取思维链响应；2）对错误响应预测提示条件以避免错误；3）使用验证数据验证提示条件有效性；4）在推理时检索最相关的提示条件作为额外上下文。

Result: 在WikiTQ和Tabfact数据集上的综合实验表明，LRTab方法具有可解释性、成本效益高，并且在表格推理任务中超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: LRTab成功整合了微调和零样本提示的优势，通过从训练数据中学习并检索相关信息，为表格理解任务提供了一种有效且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

*Hejiang Cai,Di Wu,Ji Xu,Xiang Liu,Yiziting Zhu,Xin Shu,Yujie Li,Bin Yi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的深度学习框架，结合无监督自动编码器和多层感知器分类器，用于ICU脓毒症早期检测，在三个ICU队列中准确率分别达到74.6%、80.6%和93.5%，显著优于传统机器学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脓毒症是危及生命的疾病，需要及时检测。传统机器学习方法依赖手动特征工程，难以处理电子健康记录中不规则、不完整的时间序列数据。

Method: 端到端深度学习框架：使用无监督自动编码器进行自动特征提取，多层感知器分类器进行二元脓毒症风险预测。采用定制下采样策略提取高信息密度片段，非重叠动态滑动窗口机制进行实时推理。预处理时间序列数据表示为具有明确缺失指示符的固定维度向量。

Result: 在三个ICU队列中分别获得74.6%、80.6%和93.5%的准确率，持续优于传统机器学习基线方法（朴素贝叶斯、SVM、随机森林、XGBoost）。

Conclusion: 该框架在异质ICU环境中展现出卓越的鲁棒性、泛化能力和临床实用性，适用于脓毒症早期检测。

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合统计物理、编码理论和代数拓扑的统一框架，用于高效多类图像分类。通过将高维特征向量解释为稀疏多边类型准循环LDPC图上的自旋，构建随机键Ising模型，在Nishimori温度下最大化类别可分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一种高效的图像分类方法，通过物理启发的嵌入和拓扑指导的图设计，实现大规模特征压缩的同时保持高分类精度。

Method: 使用冻结的MobileNetV2主干提取特征，构建MET-QC-LDPC图上的随机键Ising模型，在Nishimori温度下操作，利用拓扑指导设计球形和环形图集合，抑制有害陷阱集。

Result: 在ImageNet-10上达到98.7%准确率，ImageNet-100上达到82.7%准确率，实现了40倍参数压缩（从1280维压缩到32或64维）。

Conclusion: 拓扑指导的图设计能够产生高效、物理启发的嵌入，在保持最先进性能的同时实现显著的特征压缩。

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: StructRTL是一个结构感知的图自监督学习框架，通过从控制数据流图(CDFG)中学习结构感知表示，显著提升了RTL设计质量估计性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的方法忽略了RTL代码的结构语义，而CDFG视图能更明确地展示设计结构特征，为表示学习提供更丰富的线索

Method: 提出结构感知的图自监督学习框架，从CDFG学习结构感知表示，并采用知识蒸馏策略将后映射网表的低级洞察转移到CDFG预测器中

Result: 在各种质量估计任务上显著优于现有技术，建立了新的最先进结果

Conclusion: 结合结构学习和跨阶段监督的方法在RTL设计质量估计中表现出有效性

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

TL;DR: FLAegis是一个两阶段防御框架，通过符号时间序列变换和谱聚类检测拜占庭客户端，并采用FFT聚合函数增强联邦学习系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性限制了训练过程的可见性，依赖客户端诚实性，容易被恶意拜占庭客户端通过提交虚假模型更新进行投毒攻击。

Method: 提出两阶段防御框架：1）使用符号时间序列变换（SAX）放大良性模型与恶意模型的差异；2）采用谱聚类准确检测对抗行为；3）集成基于FFT的鲁棒聚合函数作为最终防护层。

Result: 在五种投毒攻击（从简单标签翻转到自适应优化策略）的严格评估中，该方法在检测精度和最终模型准确性方面均优于最先进的防御方法，即使在强对抗条件下也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: FLAegis框架有效提升了联邦学习系统对拜占庭客户端攻击的防御能力，通过多阶段检测和聚合机制确保了系统的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

TL;DR: 本文分析了离线强化学习和逆强化学习中的Bellman残差最小化方法，提出了新的稳定性分析和样本复杂度结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线强化学习和逆强化学习实践中难以有效实施Bellman一致性，虽然已有基于随机梯度下降上升的全局收敛方法，但其在离线设置下的统计行为尚未充分研究

Method: 引入单个Lyapunov势能函数来耦合相邻数据集上的SGDA运行，获得O(1/n)的平均参数稳定性界限，并将该稳定性常数转化为BRM的O(1/n)超额风险界限

Result: 将凸凹鞍点问题的最佳已知样本复杂度指数提高了一倍，无需方差缩减、额外正则化或对minibatch采样的严格独立性假设

Conclusion: 该分析为Bellman残差最小化方法提供了理论保证，结果适用于标准神经网络参数化和minibatch SGD设置

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于约束的MILP模型简化方法，通过将关键不等式约束转换为等式来加速求解，相比现有方法提升解质量50%以上，减少计算时间17.47%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型简化方法主要基于变量约简，而从对偶视角看约束约简同样能降低MILP复杂度但被忽视，因此需要探索约束约简方法

Method: 首先标记最优解处的紧约束作为潜在关键约束，设计启发式规则选择关键紧约束子集；提出多模态表示技术，利用实例级和抽象级MILP公式信息学习关键紧约束

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进方法，本方法提升解质量50%以上，减少计算时间17.47%

Conclusion: 约束约简是有效的MILP加速方法，多模态表示技术能有效识别关键约束，为大规模MILP问题求解提供了新思路

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

TL;DR: UltraMemV2是一种改进的内存层架构，通过五项关键改进实现了与8专家MoE模型相当的性能，同时显著降低了内存访问成本，在内存密集型任务上表现尤为出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合专家(MoE)模型在推理时内存访问成本高的问题，同时提升内存层架构的性能以匹配最先进的8专家MoE配置。

Method: 五项关键改进：1)在每层transformer块中集成内存层；2)使用单线性投影简化值扩展；3)采用基于FFN的值处理；4)实施原则性参数初始化；5)重新平衡内存与FFN的计算比例。

Result: UltraMemV2在相同计算和参数下达到与8专家MoE模型相当的性能，内存访问显著降低。在内存密集型任务上表现突出：长上下文记忆+1.6分，多轮记忆+6.2分，上下文学习+7.9分。验证了激活密度比稀疏参数总数对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: UltraMemV2使内存层架构达到与最先进MoE模型相当的性能，为高效稀疏计算提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

*Helen Pervez,Suyash Gaurav,Jukka Heikkonen,Jatin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS)方案，通过模块化、策略驱动的执行层来规范分布式AI系统中自治执行的多代理协同，解决现有监管机制的反应式、脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统向分布式生态系统发展，具有自治执行、异步推理和多代理协同特性，缺乏可扩展、解耦的治理机制带来结构性风险。现有监管机制通常是反应式、脆弱的，并嵌入在代理架构中，导致无法审计且难以在异构部署中统一应用。

Method: 提出Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS)：一个模块化、策略驱动的执行层，在运行时规范代理输出而不需修改模型内部或代理协作。GaaS采用声明式规则和信任因子机制，根据遵循情况和严重程度评估的违规行为给代理进行评分。支持强制性、规范性和适应性干预，实现分级执法和动态信任调节。

Result: 通过三种模拟方案评估GaaS：基准方案无治理、GaaS执行策略、对抗性代理测试稳固性。使用开源模型(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1)在内容生成和金融决策场景中进行测试。所有动作都被截获、评估和记录。结果显示GaaS可靠地阻止或重定向高风险行为，同时保持吞吐量。信任评分跟踪规则遵循情况，在多代理系统中隔离和惩罚不可信组件。

Conclusion: 通过将治理定位为运行时服务（类似于计算或存储服务），GaaS为可互操作的代理生态系统建立了基础设施级别的对齐。它不是教会代理道德规范，而是强制执行道德规范。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

TL;DR: 本文研究联邦学习中客户端标签集异构性问题，比较了公开标签和私有标签设置下的模型性能差异，提出了标准联邦学习方法的适应性改进方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中客户端标签集异构性很常见但研究较少，特别是当客户端只与中央服务器共享私有标签集时，这会增加学习算法的约束，是一个更难解决的问题。

Method: 应用分类器组合问题的经典方法进行集中调优，将常见联邦学习方法适配到私有标签集设置，并在实际假设下讨论两种方法的合理性。

Result: 实验显示减少每个客户端可用标签数量会显著损害所有方法的性能。集中调优客户端模型表示对齐可以改善性能，但通常以更高方差为代价。提出的标准联邦学习方法适应性方案在私有标签设置下表现良好，性能与标准方法在公开设置下相当。

Conclusion: 客户端可以在几乎不损失模型准确性的情况下享受更高的隐私保护，标准联邦学习方法的适应性改进在私有标签设置下是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

Motivation: 现有去偏方法需要原始训练数据和大量重新训练，且在公平性和性能之间存在权衡。医疗等敏感领域需要更高效的去偏解决方案。

Method: 首先识别模型参数对偏差和预测性能的相对贡献，然后采用两步微调过程，根据参数贡献定义不同的梯度流来更新每个参数。

Result: 在三个偏差敏感属性（性别、肤色、年龄）和六个医疗数据集上的实验表明，SWiFT能持续减少模型偏差，同时保持或提升诊断准确性，并在多个分布外数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SWiFT提供了一种高效且有效的去偏方法，在减少计算成本的同时实现了公平性和性能的双重提升，特别适用于医疗等敏感领域的实际应用。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Motivation: 传统分类器在面对变化的恶意软件感知领域时，缺乏有效的决策延迟和适应机制，无法在概念漏流环境中维持表现。现代恶意软件检测流程需要结合主动学习和拒绝机制来减轻概念漏流的影响。

Conclusion: 证明深度强化学习可以在Android恶意软件动态环境中实现有效的检测和提高概念漏流弱性，为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

*Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Jalal Etesami,Pouria Fatemi,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的上下文决斗bandit模型，允许算法在用户消费历史中选择比较项，无需额外遗憾成本，通过矩阵浓度边界证明达到O(√T)遗憾界


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文决斗bandit模型只捕获用户隐式选择，但用户消费后提供的比较反馈更可靠。为利用消费历史中的比较查询而不产生额外遗憾

Method: 算法每步推荐一个物品，用户消费后要求与历史消费记录中的另一个物品进行比较。通过初始随机探索阶段积累丰富历史，利用矩阵浓度边界分析

Result: 理论证明达到O(√T)遗憾界，模拟显示重用历史物品进行比较比仅比较同时推荐物品显著降低遗憾

Conclusion: 提出的新bandit模型能有效利用用户消费历史进行可靠比较，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

Conclusion: C-Flat和C-Flat++为持续学习提供了有效的平坦最小化解决方案，能够改善模型在持续学习任务中的表现，同时保持较高的计算效率。

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

TL;DR: MOCHA是一个新颖的框架，用于在时间点过程中发现多阶动态因果关系，通过建模时变有向无环图和端到端可微分框架，在事件预测和可解释因果结构发现方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖静态或一阶因果结构，忽略了因果关系的多阶性和时变特性，无法充分建模真实世界事件序列中的复杂因果依赖关系。

Method: 提出MOCHA框架，将多阶影响建模为潜在时变图上的多跳因果路径，使用时变有向无环图（DAG）和可学习结构权重，施加无环性和稀疏性约束，设计端到端可微分框架联合建模因果发现和TPP动态。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，MOCHA不仅在事件预测方面达到了最先进的性能，而且揭示了有意义且可解释的因果结构。

Conclusion: MOCHA框架成功解决了时间点过程中多阶动态因果关系的发现问题，为复杂事件序列的建模提供了有效的解决方案，在预测准确性和结构可解释性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

TL;DR: HAEPO是一种新的探索性策略优化方法，通过累积对数似然和Plackett-Luce softmax来增强长时域任务中的探索能力，同时结合熵正则化和KL惩罚来保持稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和GRPO在长时域任务中探索能力有限，需要一种能够充分利用完整轨迹历史并平衡探索与稳定性的新方法。

Method: 将轨迹压缩为累积对数似然，使用Plackett-Luce softmax获得与回报成正比的归一化权重，添加熵正则化和软KL惩罚来稳定训练。

Result: HAEPO收敛快、探索充分、与真实奖励对齐紧密，在多样化任务中表现优于或等同于PPO、GRPO和DPO。

Conclusion: HAEPO提供了一个稳定且可解释的框架，通过显式利用完整轨迹历史来平衡探索和稳定性。

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient,
and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in
modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse
data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that
explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a
cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data
engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,
protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic
normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.
pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of
sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss
functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include
batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize
computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning
models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a
modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license
at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time
series research and applications.

Motivation: 标准神经过程(NPs)依赖全局潜在变量，在不确定性校准和捕捉局部数据依赖方面存在困难，需要改进这些局限性。

Method: 引入全局潜在变量建模任务级变化，局部潜在变量在距离保持的潜在空间中捕捉输入相似性，通过双Lipschitz正则化约束输入关系失真并保持相对距离。

Result: DNP在回归和分类任务中实现了强大的预测性能和改进的不确定性校准，能更有效地区分分布内和分布外数据。

Conclusion: 距离感知神经过程通过结合全局和局部潜在结构，显著提升了不确定性估计的质量和模型性能。

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 这是首次为具有一般非线性动态的神经ODE推导出泛化界，为这类连续深度架构模型的泛化性能提供了理论保证

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across
multiple time scales while managing inherent uncertainties. We propose
HierCVAE, a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention
mechanisms with conditional variational autoencoders to address these
challenges. HierCVAE employs a three-tier attention structure (local, global,
cross-temporal) combined with multi-modal condition encoding to capture
temporal, statistical, and trend information. The approach incorporates
ResFormer blocks in the latent space and provides explicit uncertainty
quantification via prediction heads. Through evaluations on energy consumption
datasets, HierCVAE demonstrates a 15-40% improvement in prediction accuracy and
superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods,
excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

Motivation: 多标签数据的标签独立性不能直接从标签值测量，需要通过条件标签协方差进行评估，但现有的多元Probit模型在估计协方差方面可能不可靠。

Method: 比较三种模型（多元Probit模型、多元Bernoulli模型和阶段性Logit模型）在估计常数协方差和依赖性协方差方面的表现，设计实验观察各模型对条件协方差的测量。

Result: 所有模型都能根据协方差强度较好地测量常数和依赖性协方差，但都会在存在常数协方差时错误检测到依赖性协方差。多元Probit模型的错误率最低。

Conclusion: 对于多标签数据标签依赖性分析，多元Probit模型是三种模型中最优的选择，但所有模型都存在在常数协方差时错误检测依赖性的问题。

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across
prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose
a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,
pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A

Conclusion: PAX-TS能够以不同详细程度说明时间序列预测模型的机制，其解释可用于回答关于预测的实际问题，为时间序列预测提供了有效的可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

Conclusion: FedProtoKD有效解决了原型边缘收缩问题，通过知识蒸馏和对比学习机制显著提升了异构联邦学习的性能表现

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法假设固定时间窗口内的模式补全，但在工业系统中，动态性受控制动作驱动、高度非平稳且可能存在长时间连续缺失，这种假设往往失效

Method: 使用条件去噪扩散模型，具有与控制理论一致的有因果偏置，基于最近已知状态和相关控制或环境输入逐步生成缺失值

Result: 在模拟缺失块的公共污水处理数据集上始终实现最低误差，优势随缺失长度增加而增强；在真实工业数据集上产生动态合理的轨迹，而基于窗口的模型倾向于平坦化或过度平滑

Conclusion: 支持动态感知、显式条件化的填补作为工业时间序列的稳健方法，讨论了计算权衡和向更广泛领域的扩展

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

Motivation: 从物理角度理解学习过程，学习本质上是一个物理过程。作者想通过简单的弹簧-棒系统来模拟机器学习，以更好地理解学习系统的物理本质。

Method: 使用棒来模拟分段线性函数近似，用弹簧的弹性势能来编码平方误差损失函数，通过耗散进行能量最小化进行学习。应用于回归任务，并研究系统的热力学性质。

Conclusion: 这个简单的物理模型可以帮助我们从物理角度更好地理解学习系统，特别是学习过程中的热力学特性和学习限制。

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

Motivation: 现有预测过程监控研究多从控制流角度出发，本文探索了资源中心视角的下一活动预测，这种方法能够提供更好的工作组织、工作负荷平衡和容量预测等额外优势。

Method: 在四个实际数据集上评估四种预测模型（LightGBM、Transformer、随机森林等）和三种编码策略，包括2-gram活动迁移编码和活动重复特征组合编码。

Result: 结果显示LightGBM和Transformer模型在2-gram活动迁移编码下表现最佳，随机森林在组合编码下表现最好。组合编码策略获得了最高的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 资源中心的下一活动预测方法为智能资源分配、战略性劳动力规划和个性化员工支持提供了可能，为预测过程监控领域开启了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

Conclusion: 为选择适用于威胜智能和网络防御的主动学习相似性函数提供了可操作的见解

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

Motivation: 传统早停方法需要验证集，减少了训练数据量。梯度下降算法已经产生了梯度信息，这些信息可以免费利用来估计过拟合

Method: 通过梯度信息估计贝叶斯后验分布，将早停问题定义为从该后验中采样，并使用近似后验获得停止准则

Conclusion: GradStop能够利用全部数据集进行训练，特别在数据受限场景（如迁移学习）中具有优势，可作为梯度下降库的可选功能

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source
code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

Motivation: 识别现代重复模型如状态空间模型(SSMs)与Transformer在理解和记忆任务上的性能差异，通过联想回忆准则进行深入分析，探索训练稳定性和网络扩展对性能的影响。

Method: 使用联想回忆准则进行实验，涉及学习率选择、网络深度与宽度扩展、训练动力学分析以及结构消融实验等多种方法。

Conclusion: 现代重复模型在训练稳定性方面需要进一步研究，Transformer和重复模型在网络扩展方面存在补充性优势，为模型设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

Method: 开发透明的ML架构，每个输入变量独立处理并线性相加得到输出，使用HazBinLoss函数给关键近场大震级记录赋予更高权重

Result: 模型能够捐据已知的地震学原理，与现有GMMs达到相当的性能表现，同时保持透明性

Conclusion: 该框架促进了基于机器学习的风险评估和灾害规划方法的更广泛采用

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

Motivation: 探索GNN在传统近似角色之外的能力，特别是在生成数值格式和超出训练域外推方面的潜力，以开发新的数值方法。

Method: 使用符号回归结合GNN，首先在双节点图数据集上训练GNN，然后在无监督环境下使用类似PINN的残差损失，进一步扩展到高阶格式的发现。

Result: GNN能够在超出分布的非结构化网格上外推一阶有限体积格式，误差为O(ε)；通过符号回归重新发现了标准一阶格式；在无监督设置下恢复了高阶格式。

Conclusion: GNN不仅是强大的近似器，还能积极贡献于新数值方法的开发，这符合科学计算的新范式。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的联邦学习数据忘印方案，在保持模型性能的同时实现高效数据删除

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Conclusion: APT-LLM通过系统级的优化方法有效解决了GPU上任意精度LLM推理的加速问题，为超低位宽量化模型的部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型的对齐和组合提供了理论保证和实用算法，能有效处理多个竞争性属性的权衡问题

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续情感识别方法要么忽略情感的模糊性，要么将模糊性视为独立且静态的时间变量，无法有效处理情感固有的模糊性和动态特性。

Method: 提出模糊感知序数情感表示框架，通过情感模糊性的变化率来建模情感模糊性，在RECOLA和GameVibe两个情感语料库上测试有界（唤醒度、效价）和无界（参与度）连续情感轨迹。

Result: 序数表示在无界标签上优于传统模糊感知模型，获得最高的CCC和SDA分数；在有界轨迹上，序数表示在SDA方面表现优异，显示出捕捉标注情感轨迹相对变化的卓越能力。

Conclusion: 模糊感知序数情感表示框架能够有效捕捉情感标注的模糊性和情感轨迹的时序动态特性，特别是在处理无界情感标签和相对变化建模方面表现出色。

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

### [277] [Understanding Tool-Integrated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19201)
*Heng Lin,Zhongwen Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论上证明了工具集成推理(TIR)能够严格扩展大语言模型的能力边界，通过Python解释器等工具解锁纯文本模型无法实现的问题解决策略，并提出了ASPO算法来优化工具使用行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然工具集成的大语言模型显示出巨大潜力，但缺乏解释为什么这种范式有效的理论原理。本文旨在填补这一空白，为TIR的成功提供首个原则性解释。

Method: 提出了优势塑造策略优化(ASPO)算法，直接修改优势函数来引导策略行为而不影响训练稳定性。在数学基准测试中使用Python解释器作为外部工具进行综合实验。

Result: TIR模型在pass@k指标上显著优于纯文本模型，优势不仅限于计算密集型问题，还扩展到需要抽象洞察力的问题。ASPO改善了工具使用行为，实现了更早的代码调用和更多交互轮次。

Conclusion: 工具集成推理从根本上扩展了LLM的能力边界，打破了纯文本模型的能力天花板。研究揭示了模型如何学会使用工具思考的认知模式，为理解TIR为什么和如何实现更强大的推理提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

### [278] [Predicting the Order of Upcoming Tokens Improves Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19228)
*Zayd M. K. Zuhri,Erland Hilman Fuadi,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Token Order Prediction (TOP)作为多令牌预测(MTP)的改进替代方案，通过排序学习损失来预测令牌顺序而非精确内容，在多个NLP基准测试中优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多令牌预测(MTP)作为辅助目标在语言模型训练中表现不一致，在标准NLP基准测试中表现不佳，作者认为MTP的精确未来令牌预测作为辅助损失过于困难

Method: 提出Token Order Prediction (TOP)方法，训练模型通过排序学习损失来按接近程度排序即将到来的令牌，相比MTP只需要单个额外的解嵌入层而非多个transformer层

Result: 在340M、1.8B和7B参数规模的模型预训练中，TOP在八个标准NLP基准测试中整体优于NTP和MTP，即使在较大规模下也保持优势

Conclusion: TOP作为辅助训练目标比MTP更有效，通过降低预测难度（从精确内容预测改为顺序预测）实现了更好的性能表现，且计算开销更小

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is
available at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/token-order-prediction
