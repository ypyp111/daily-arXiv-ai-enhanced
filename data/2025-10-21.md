### [1] [ESCA: Contextualizing Embodied Agents via Scene-Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15963)
*Jiani Huang,Amish Sethi,Matthew Kuo,Mayank Keoliya,Neelay Velingker,JungHo Jung,Ser-Nam Lim,Ziyang Li,Mayur Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架和SGClip模型，通过结构化时空理解来情境化具身智能体，无需人工标注的场景图数据，在具身环境中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要依赖高级视觉-声音-文本对，缺乏像素级视觉内容与文本语义的细粒度结构化对齐

Method: 提出SGClip模型，基于CLIP的开放域可提示场景图生成模型，通过神经符号学习管道在87K+开放域视频上训练，利用模型驱动的自监督和结构化推理

Result: SGClip在场景图生成和动作定位基准测试中表现出色，ESCA框架持续改进开源和商业MLLMs，在两个具身环境中实现最先进性能，显著减少感知错误

Conclusion: ESCA框架通过结构化空间-时间理解有效情境化具身智能体，使开源模型超越专有基线，展示了无需人工标注的场景图学习的有效性

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

### [2] [CrossRay3D: Geometry and Distribution Guidance for Efficient Multimodal 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15991)
*Huiming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CrossRay3D稀疏多模态检测器，通过Ray-Aware监督和Class-Balanced监督提升token表示质量，在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，且运行速度快1.84倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏检测器忽视token表示质量，导致前景质量欠佳和性能受限。本文发现几何结构保持和类别分布是提升稀疏检测器性能的关键。

Method: 提出Sparse Selector(SS)模块，包含Ray-Aware Supervision(RAS)保持几何信息，Class-Balanced Supervision自适应重加权类别语义，以及Ray Positional Encoding解决LiDAR和图像模态分布差异。

Result: 在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，运行速度快1.84倍，且在LiDAR或相机数据部分或完全缺失时仍保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossRay3D通过改进token表示质量，在保持稀疏检测器优势的同时显著提升了性能，证明了几何结构保持和类别平衡监督的重要性。

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

### [3] [InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16017)
*Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed,Abdullah Yahya Abdullah Omaisan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个利用街景CCTV监控流进行多缺陷检测和分割的完整管道，结合YOLO目标检测器和视觉语言模型生成结构化维护计划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能城市基础设施监控需求增长，手动检查成本高且危险，现有自动系统通常只处理单一缺陷类型或输出非结构化结果

Method: 使用YOLO系列目标检测器进行多缺陷检测和分割，然后将检测结果传递给视觉语言模型进行场景感知总结，生成包含事件描述、推荐工具、尺寸、维修计划和紧急警报的JSON格式结构化行动方案

Result: 在公共数据集和捕获的CCTV片段上的实验评估表明，系统能准确识别多种缺陷并产生连贯的总结

Conclusion: 讨论了将系统扩展到城市范围部署的挑战和方向

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

### [4] [IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036)
*Zewen Li,Zitong Yu,Qilang Ye,Weicheng Xie,Wei Zhuo,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-GPT是一个基于多模态大语言模型的工业异常检测新范式，通过异常提示生成器、文本引导增强器和多掩码融合模块，结合文本语义与图像信息实现先进的异常检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业异常检测方法缺乏多轮人机对话和详细描述能力，而基于大预训练模型的方法尚未充分激发大模型在异常检测任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用异常提示生成器生成详细异常提示，通过文本引导增强器增强视觉定位能力，采用多掩码融合模块将掩码作为专家知识增强像素级异常感知。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在自监督和少样本异常检测与分割任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IAD-GPT成功结合了文本语义与图像信息，为工业异常检测提供了一种有效的新方法，在多个基准数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种放射学报告模式（自由文本、结构化报告、AI辅助结构化报告）对图像分析行为、诊断准确性、效率和用户体验的影响。AI辅助结构化报告在诊断准确性和效率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估结构化报告和人工智能如何改变放射科医生与影像研究的交互方式，比较不同报告模式对诊断性能和工作流程的影响。

Method: 前瞻性研究（2024年7-12月），8名参与者（4名新手和4名非新手）使用定制查看器和眼动追踪系统分析35张床旁胸片。评估诊断准确性、报告时间、眼动指标和用户体验问卷。

Result: AI-SR诊断准确性最高（κ=0.71），报告时间最短（25±9秒），眼动指标显示视觉注意力更集中于图像区域。新手读者在SR模式下将注视点转向图像，而非新手读者保持对图像的关注。

Conclusion: 结构化报告通过引导视觉注意力朝向图像来提高效率，而AI预填充的结构化报告进一步提升了诊断准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

### [6] [Data-Driven Analysis of Intersectional Bias in Image Classification: A Framework with Bias-Weighted Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16072)
*Farjana Yesmin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于分析和缓解图像分类中交叉偏见的框架IFEF和偏置加权增强方法BWA，在Open Images V7数据集上显著提升了代表性不足子组的准确率并减少了公平性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在非平衡数据集上训练时经常表现出交叉偏见，这些偏见源于多个属性（如物体类别和环境条件）的相互作用，需要系统性的分析和缓解方法。

Method: 提出了交叉公平性评估框架IFEF，结合定量公平性指标和可解释性工具识别偏见模式；开发了偏置加权增强BWA，基于子组分布统计自适应调整变换强度。

Result: 在Open Images V7数据集上，BWA将代表性不足的类别-环境交叉子组的准确率提升了最高24个百分点，公平性指标差距减少了35%，统计显著性p<0.05。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析和解决图像分类系统中的交叉偏见提供了可复现的途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

### [7] [Differentiable, Bit-shifting, and Scalable Quantization without training neural network from scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16088)
*Zia Badar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分的量化方法，支持多比特量化，在ImageNet数据集上使用ResNet18进行权重量化时，仅需15个训练周期就能达到与全精度模型相差不到1%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法存在两个主要问题：一是大多使用不可微分的方法，在反向传播时需要手动设置导数，影响学习能力；二是现有的移位/对数量化方法要么避免激活量化，要么准确率较低。

Method: 提出可微分的量化方法，支持n比特量化，特别是支持形式为2^n的对数量化值，不需要高精度乘法运算。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，仅权重量化时准确率与全精度模型相差不到1%；权重和激活同时量化时，准确率与最先进方法相当，推理成本略高于1比特量化但无需高精度乘法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了收敛性证明，支持多比特量化，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出StripRFNet用于道路表面损伤检测，通过形状感知、条状感受野和小尺度增强三个模块解决多样化损伤形状、细长裂缝检测和小尺度损伤识别等挑战，在RDD2022基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路表面损伤威胁交通安全并阻碍可持续城市发展，但准确检测面临挑战：损伤形状多样、细长裂缝难以捕捉、小尺度损伤识别错误率高。

Method: StripRFNet包含三个模块：形状感知模块（SPM）通过大分离核注意力增强形状判别；条状感受野模块（SRFM）使用大条状卷积和池化捕捉细长裂缝特征；小尺度增强模块（SSEM）利用高分辨率P2特征图、专用检测头和动态上采样改进小目标检测。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中，中国子集的F1分数、mAP50和mAP50:95分别比基线提高4.4、2.9和3.4个百分点；完整数据集上达到80.33%的最高F1分数，同时保持有竞争力的推理速度。

Conclusion: StripRFNet实现了最先进的准确性和实时效率，为智能道路维护和可持续基础设施管理提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

*Nishad Sahu,Shounak Sural,Aditya Satish Patil,Ragunathan,Rajkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjectTransforms是一种通过对象特定变换来量化和减少视觉目标检测中不确定性的技术，在训练和推理阶段分别提升鲁棒性和量化预测不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中可靠的感知对安全决策至关重要，但基于视觉的目标检测神经网络容易受到数据偏差和分布偏移等因素带来的不确定性影响。

Method: 在训练时对单个目标进行颜色空间扰动，并使用扩散模型生成多样化行人实例；在推理时对检测到的目标应用扰动，利用检测分数的方差实时量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在NuImages 10K数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有目标类别上都带来了显著的精度提升和不确定性减少，推理时对假阳性预测了更高的不确定性值。

Conclusion: ObjectTransforms作为一种轻量级但有效的机制，在训练和推理阶段分别具有减少和量化视觉感知不确定性的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过周期性添加指导来改进3D外观迁移，在几何差异大的情况下仍能成功传输纹理和几何细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在输入和外观对象的几何形状差异较大时表现不佳，直接应用3D生成模型无法产生令人满意的结果。

Method: 基于预训练的整流流模型，在采样过程中周期性添加可微损失函数作为指导，包括部分感知损失和自相似性损失。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可扩展到不同类型的扩散模型和指导函数，为3D外观迁移提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but
it is resource and personnel-intensive. We propose employing deep learning to
automate critical aspects of thrombectomy, thereby enhancing efficiency and
safety. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised framework that classifies
various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully
autonomous C-arm control, aiming to optimize trajectories from the pelvis to
the head during stroke thrombectomy procedures. All code used is available at

Conclusion: DuetMatch通过创新的双分支异步优化和多种正则化技术，有效解决了医学图像半监督分割中的收敛稳定性和噪声鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自主导航C臂到预定义解剖标志的管道，利用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合不确定性估计和保形预测确保可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床工作流程依赖手动对齐C臂，增加了辐射暴露和程序延迟，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和安全性。

Method: 使用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合概率损失和骨骼姿态正则化，采用保形预测校准不确定性，生成3D置信区域。

Result: 在DeepDRR生成的合成X射线数据集上验证，显示出强大的定位准确性和良好校准的预测边界。

Conclusion: 该管道有潜力成为安全可靠自主C臂系统的组成部分，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

Motivation: 当前深度生成模型生成的图像质量仍达不到传统摄影标准，生产流程中需要手动图像质量评估，这个过程缓慢且昂贵

Method: 引入自动预过滤阶段，使用公式估计成本节省，并在背景修复用例中应用简单的AutoML解决方案

Result: 在背景修复用例中实现了51.61%的成本节省

Conclusion: 自动预过滤可以显著降低获取高质量图像的平均成本

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

Conclusion: 使用结构化文本作为中间空间来桥接fMRI信号和图像重建具有重要意义，文本表示和生成模型需要适应视觉刺激的组合性质，包括对象、详细属性和关系。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

*Nyle Siddiqui,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StretchySnake的灵活训练方法，通过动态调整时空分辨率来增强状态空间模型在视频理解中的适应性，解决了现有方法在未训练分辨率下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解训练方法主要针对transformer设计，无法充分利用状态空间模型的独特优势。视频模型通常以固定分辨率和长度训练，导致在未见过的时空分辨率下性能下降，限制了模型处理不同长度视频的能力。

Method: 提出灵活训练方法，在训练过程中采样不同时空分辨率的视频，并动态插值模型权重以适应任意时空尺度。比较了五种不同的灵活训练变体，确定了最适合视频状态空间模型的策略。

Result: 在短动作（UCF-101、HMDB-51）和长动作（COIN、Breakfast）基准测试中，StretchySnake比transformer和状态空间模型基线性能提升高达28%，在细粒度动作数据集（SSV2、Diving-48）上表现出强大的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单的即插即用训练方案，使视频状态空间模型在各种动作识别场景中更加鲁棒、分辨率无关且高效。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有CNN模型难以捕捉全局面部特征，ViT能建模长距离空间关系但存在二次复杂度问题，需要结合线性复杂度的Mamba模型来互补优势。

Method: 使用异构集成架构，ViT骨干捕捉全局面部结构和对称性，Mamba骨干以线性复杂度建模长距离依赖关系，关注序列特征和纹理。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上取得PC=0.9212、MAE=0.2085、RMSE=0.2698的SOTA性能，并通过Grad-CAM可视化验证了两个骨干的互补特征提取。

Conclusion: VM-BeautyNet为计算美学提供了强大的新架构范式，通过融合ViT和Mamba的互补优势，在面部美观度预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

Motivation: OCSCC是头颈部最常见的癌症，由于早期症状不明显、生长部位隐蔽且生长缓慢，往往难以早期发现，导致可预防的死亡。利用CNN的精确图像分割和模式识别能力可以实现早期检测。

Method: 训练了一个CNN模型，使用4293张包含良性、恶性肿瘤和阴性样本的训练图像。设计了图像采集和处理硬件系统，测试了不同分辨率图像对检测准确性的影响，并开发了应用程序。

Result: 图像分辨率越高，预测准确性越高，但呈现对数增长趋势，表明像素数增加带来的收益递减。设计的增强硬件能够捕获详细图像并提高检测效果。

Conclusion: CNN结合专门的图像采集硬件可以有效检测OCSCC，图像分辨率对检测准确性有重要影响，但存在收益递减效应。开发的系统为OCSCC早期检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Motivation: 人类行为是场景动态的主要来源，包含丰富的动态线索。传统静态物体级重建方法存在固有模糊性，需要利用人类与物体的交互来动态优化重建过程。

Method: 采用在线方法，利用人-物交互迭代分解和重建环境。系统整合相机和物体姿态估计、实例分解、在线地图更新等多个任务，基于高斯泼溅技术实现准确一致的动态场景建模。

Conclusion: 通过利用人-物交互线索，提出的主动场景分解重建方法为动态环境提供了一种灵活渐进的重建方案，能够有效解决静态重建中的模糊性问题。

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的视频异常检测方法虽然零样本检测能力强，但计算成本高且视觉定位不稳定，难以实时部署。

Method: 采用两级级联系统：离线学习正常行为规则，在线推理时结合轻量级过滤和细粒度VLM推理，创新包括运动掩码提示和基于规则的偏差检测。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估显示，Cerberus在NVIDIA L40S GPU上平均达到57.68 fps，速度提升151.79倍，准确率达到97.2%，与最先进的VLM-based VAD方法相当。

Conclusion: Cerberus为实时视频分析提供了一个实用解决方案，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了检测速度。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time
video analytics.

TL;DR: OpenLVLM-MIA是一个新的基准测试，揭示了评估大型视觉语言模型成员推理攻击时存在的根本挑战。研究发现先前工作的高攻击成功率实际上源于检测数据集构建中的分布偏差，而非真正的成员状态识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前关于大型视觉语言模型成员推理攻击的研究报告了高攻击成功率，但这些结果可能源于数据集构建中的分布偏差，而非真正的成员状态识别能力。需要建立一个无偏见的基准来准确评估MIA方法的真实性能。

Method: 构建了一个包含6,000张图像的受控基准测试，其中成员和非成员样本的分布经过仔细平衡，并在三个不同的训练阶段提供真实成员标签。使用该基准评估最先进的MIA方法。

Result: 实验显示，在无偏条件下，最先进的MIA方法的性能收敛到随机猜测水平，表明先前的高攻击成功率确实源于数据集偏差。

Conclusion: OpenLVLM-MIA基准揭示了当前LVLM成员推理攻击研究的局限性，为开发更强的隐私保护技术提供了坚实基础，强调了在无偏条件下评估MIA方法的重要性。

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving
techniques.

Conclusion: 该框架无需训练即可实现精确的笔画属性迁移，在保持结构完整性的同时自适应整合参考笔画特征。

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

Motivation: 由于现有数据集无法满足研究规模需求，需要构建大规模数据集来系统分析深度伪造检测任务的缩放规律。

Method: 构建了ScaleDF数据集（包含580万张真实图像和880万张伪造图像），分析模型性能与真实图像域数量、深度伪造方法数量和训练图像数量的关系。

Result: 观察到平均检测错误率随真实域数量或深度伪造方法数量的增加呈幂律衰减，可以预测达到目标性能所需的额外资源。

Conclusion: 缩放规律不仅有助于预测性能提升，还能以数据为中心的方式应对不断演进的深度伪造技术，同时研究了预训练和数据增强在缩放中的作用及缩放本身的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

TL;DR: Scale-DiT是一个用于超高分辨率文本到图像生成的扩散框架，通过分层局部注意力和低分辨率全局引导，在4K分辨率下实现高效、可扩展且语义一致的图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型受限于注意力机制的二次复杂性和缺乏原生4K训练数据，无法支持超过1K×1K分辨率的图像生成。

Method: 采用分层局部注意力机制，将高分辨率潜在空间划分为固定大小的局部窗口以降低计算复杂度；使用低分辨率潜在空间提供全局语义引导；通过LoRA适配器连接全局和局部路径；采用Hilbert曲线重排token序列和融合内核优化推理效率。

Result: Scale-DiT在4K×4K分辨率下实现比密集注意力基线快2倍以上的推理速度和更低的内存使用，在FID、IS、CLIP Score等定量指标和定性比较中均表现出色，无需额外高分辨率训练数据。

Conclusion: 分层局部注意力配合引导性低分辨率锚点是推进超高分辨率图像生成的有效方法。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成过程计算密集、用户需要多次迭代优化提示导致的延迟高和云端资源负担重的问题

Method: 采用云边协作框架，轻量级设备端扩散模型快速生成预览图像，高容量云端模型进行最终优化，并引入噪声水平预测器动态平衡计算负载

Result: 相比Stable Diffusion v1.5平均生成时间减少15.8%，图像质量相当；相比Tiny-SD仅慢0.9%但图像质量显著提升

Conclusion: DiffusionX在最小开销下展示了效率和可扩展性，为高效的多轮提示图像生成提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: TokenAR框架通过token级增强机制解决多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，包含token索引嵌入、指导token注入和身份token解耦策略，显著提升了自回归模型在多主体图像生成中的身份一致性和背景重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归模型在多参考图像生成中存在不同参考身份解耦困难的问题，导致身份混淆。

Method: 提出TokenAR框架，包含三个token级增强组件：1) Token Index Embedding聚类token索引以更好表示相同参考图像；2) Instruct Token Injection作为额外视觉特征容器注入详细补充先验；3) 身份token解耦策略(ITD)明确引导token表示独立表示每个身份特征。

Conclusion: TokenAR框架有效解决了多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，通过token级增强显著提升了自回归模型的性能，并发布了首个开源大规模多参考图像生成数据集InstructAR。

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

### [30] [RL makes MLLMs see better than SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16333)
*Junha Song,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Jaegul Choo,Byeongho Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了多模态语言模型(MLLM)性能主要继承自LLM骨干网络的假设，发现训练策略(特别是强化学习RL)能显著重塑视觉编码器的表征能力，并提出了PIVOT方法以高效提升视觉编码器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM研究过度关注LLM骨干网络而忽视视觉编码器的作用，特别是在从监督微调(SFT)转向强化学习(RL)的训练范式转变中，缺乏对视觉编码器如何被重塑的分析。

Method: 通过多种深度实验分析视觉编码器，包括ImageNet分类、分割和梯度可视化，比较SFT和RL训练策略对视觉表征的影响，并开发了PIVOT方法优化视觉编码器。

Result: RL相比SFT能产生更强且定位更精确的视觉表征，PIVOT训练的视觉编码器性能优于更大规模训练的对手，且计算成本不到标准视觉预训练的1%。

Conclusion: 训练策略不仅影响MLLM下游任务表现，还从根本上重塑视觉表征，PIVOT为MLLM视觉骨干网络的发展提供了高效路径。

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言辅助图像聚类方法主要依赖CLIP特征空间筛选正名词，但缺乏严格理论基础，需要更可靠的理论保证方法。

Method: 提出基于梯度的GradNorm框架，通过反向传播交叉熵损失的梯度幅度来度量名词的语义正性，理论证明其包含现有方法作为特例。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进的聚类性能，实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GradNorm为语言辅助图像聚类提供了理论保证的解决方案，统一了现有方法框架，在实践和理论上均有优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交制造模式在实现大规模个性化的同时，带来了质量控制方面的重大挑战，特别是在缺陷检测方面，主要困难包括产品高度定制化、生产碎片化小批量订单以及分布式站点成像环境差异大。

Method: 构建MIRAD数据集，捕捉社交制造领域的三个关键维度：多样化个性化产品、地理分散制造节点数据收集、显著成像异质性。并在该数据集上对最先进的异常检测方法进行广泛评估。

Result: 所有模型在MIRAD数据集上的性能相比传统基准都显著下降，突显了现实世界个性化生产中缺陷检测未解决的复杂性。

Conclusion: MIRAD通过弥合工业需求和学术研究，为开发工业5.0所需的稳健质量控制解决方案提供了现实基础。

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale,
annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the
diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning
models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification
cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a
range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation
layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and
anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative
skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.
The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking
experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene
segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a

on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out

particularly on India's diverse and under-maintained road networks. This paper
presents iWatchRoadv2, a fully automated end-to-end platform for real-time
pothole detection, GPS-based geotagging, and dynamic road health visualization
using OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a self-annotated dataset of over 7,000

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in
vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction,
generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for
humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean
farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes
shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and

Result: 端到端效率提升42%；在Raspberry Pi 5上解码帧率提升3.1倍；内存使用减少而准确性基本保持（PA-MPJPE从9.0mm仅增加到9.1mm）；在Raspberry Pi 5 CPU上实现2.98倍加速。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持与最先进方法相当准确性的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适合在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on
FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and
versatility. Project page: https://ChangyueShi.github.io/REALM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉中心任务中往往过度依赖语言先验，或在推理中使用文本捷径，缺乏对视觉证据的有效利用。现有强化学习方法缺乏可扩展和可靠的奖励机制。

Method: 将自监督学习目标（如图像旋转预测、掩码补丁重建）重新表述为密集、自动的奖励信号，无需人工偏好数据或不可靠的AI评估器。

Conclusion: SSL4RL建立了一个使用可验证自监督目标对齐多模态模型的多功能有效范式，为未来工作提供了新的设计原则。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

Motivation: 传统方法将点和线匹配视为独立任务，而GlueStick虽然实现了联合匹配但架构过重，无法满足实时应用或边缘设备部署需求。

Method: 提出注意力线消息传递机制，显式地将线的连通性暴露给网络，允许节点间高效通信，构建轻量级点线匹配器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中建立了新的最先进性能，同时保持轻量级架构。

Conclusion: LightGlueStick通过创新的注意力线消息传递机制，实现了高效的点线联合匹配，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了RefAtomNet++框架，用于解决参考原子视频动作识别任务，通过多层级语义对齐的交叉注意力机制和多轨迹Mamba建模，在RefAVA++数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RefAtomNet模型在跨模态信息对齐和检索能力方面存在局限，导致在定位目标人物和预测细粒度动作时表现不佳。需要开发更有效的跨模态交互机制来提升性能。

Method: 提出RefAtomNet++框架，包含多层级语义对齐交叉注意力机制（部分关键词、场景属性、整体句子层级）和多轨迹Mamba建模。通过动态选择最近的视觉空间token构建扫描轨迹，实现更有效的时空token聚合。

Result: 实验表明RefAtomNet++在RefAVA++数据集上建立了新的最先进结果，超越了包括RefAtomNet在内的多个基线模型。

Conclusion: RefAtomNet++通过创新的跨模态token聚合机制，显著提升了参考原子视频动作识别的性能，为复杂多人场景下的交互式人类动作分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are
released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的损失函数，利用高斯边界框表示和Bhattacharyya距离来提升旋转物体检测的准确性和鲁棒性，通过各向异性高斯表示解决方形物体的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统物体检测框架在处理旋转物体时表现不佳，因为它们难以捕捉方向变化，特别是在航空影像、遥感和自动驾驶等应用中需要准确检测旋转物体。

Method: 采用高斯边界框表示和Bhattacharyya距离，提出各向异性高斯表示来解决各向同性方差问题，并集成旋转不变损失函数到最先进的深度学习旋转物体检测器中。

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIPAMIN是一种视觉提示初始化策略，通过将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐，并注入超出预训练子空间的新表示方向，来增强自监督模型的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基础模型时代，完全微调预训练网络对每个下游任务来说资源消耗过大。现有的视觉提示调优方法在应用于自监督骨干网络时，往往无法专门化提示或丰富表示空间，特别是在具有挑战性的任务和数据稀缺设置中。

Method: VIPAMIN通过单次前向传播和轻量级操作，将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐，并注入新的表示方向，超越预训练子空间。

Result: VIPAMIN在各种任务和数据集大小上持续提升性能，在视觉提示调优领域达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIPAMIN是一种简单有效的视觉提示初始化策略，能够显著增强自监督模型在资源受限环境下的适应能力。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code

Motivation: 解决电子显微镜图像中线粒体分割的标注成本高问题，传统无监督域自适应方法性能有限，需要更高效的弱监督方法。

Method: 多任务学习框架联合进行分割和中心检测，采用交叉教学机制和类聚焦跨域对比学习，结合实例感知伪标签选择策略。

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上验证，性能优于现有无监督和弱监督域自适应方法，显著缩小与有监督上限的性能差距。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督和无监督设置下均取得显著改进，为生物医学图像分割提供了一种高效的标注解决方案。

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法主要基于历史信息决策，忽视了行动的未来影响和长期结果，需要开发具有前瞻性的智能体。

Method: 使用Q学习训练Q模型生成Q特征描述候选动作的潜在未来信息，通过跨模态未来编码器将任务无关的Q特征与导航指令结合，产生反映未来前景的动作分数，结合历史分数进行A*式搜索。

Result: 在广泛使用的目标导向VLN数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的前瞻性方法能够有效探索更可能到达目的地的区域，显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能。

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于3D高斯泼溅的压缩方法缺乏人体先验知识，导致解码端的比特率效率和重建质量不理想，阻碍了可流式3D虚拟人系统的应用。

Method: 将高斯表示解耦为结构层（使用StyleUNet生成器将姿态映射到高斯）和运动层（利用SMPL-X模型紧凑表示时序姿态变化），支持分层压缩、渐进解码和可控渲染。

Result: 实验结果表明HGC-Avatar为快速3D虚拟人渲染提供了可流式解决方案，在视觉质量和压缩效率方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HGC-Avatar通过分层设计和面部注意力机制，实现了高效的动态虚拟人压缩传输和高质量渲染，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

TL;DR: PRISMM-Bench是首个基于真实科学论文中审稿人标记不一致性的多模态基准测试，包含262个来自242篇论文的不一致案例，评估模型在识别、纠正和推理跨模态不一致性的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在科学研究中的应用日益增多，但尚不清楚它们是否能可靠地理解和推理论文中的多模态复杂性。现有基准测试要么隔离单一模态，要么依赖合成错误，无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性。

Method: 通过多阶段流程（包括审稿挖掘、LLM辅助过滤和人工验证）收集262个不一致案例，设计三个任务：不一致性识别、修复和配对匹配，并引入结构化JSON答案表示以减少语言偏见。

Result: 对21个领先LMM的基准测试显示性能极低（26.1-54.2%），包括大型开源模型（GLM-4.5V 106B、InternVL3 78B）和专有模型（Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5）。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了多模态科学推理的挑战性，需要推动可信赖科学助手的发展。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

Result: 提出的方法在mAP指标上超越现有最佳方法1.8%；消融研究显示辅助学习提升3.7% mAP，深度归一化提升4.2% mAP。

Conclusion: OOS-DSD通过多任务辅助学习和深度归一化有效提升了缺货检测性能，证明了辅助学习策略和深度信息对零售场景分析的价值。

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

Conclusion: 提出的基于图注意力网络自编码器的代表性中心方法在图像分类和检索任务中表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

TL;DR: READ是一种微调方法，通过添加token级重构和句子级对齐两个辅助目标来增强视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，主要是因为文本编码器倾向于关注单个单词而非它们之间的关系，而对比训练主要将单词与视觉对象对齐。

Method: READ方法在对比学习基础上添加两个辅助目标：(1) token级重构目标：使用冻结预训练解码器基于原始标题嵌入重构替代标题；(2) 句子级对齐目标：在嵌入空间中显式对齐释义句子。

Result: READ-CLIP在五个主要组合推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最强传统微调基线提升高达4.1%。应用于现有CLIP变体也能提升这些基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 重构和对齐目标提供互补优势：重构鼓励编码器捕获标题内单词间关系，而对齐确保不同措辞的释义具有一致表示。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

Motivation: 现有步态识别方法使用预定义区域和固定时间尺度，难以建模随时间动态变化的运动区域和适应其特定模式，特别是在协变量影响视觉外观时。

Method: 提出区域感知动态聚合与激励框架(GaitRDAE)，包含两个核心模块：RDA模块动态搜索每个区域的最佳时间感受野，RDE模块强调包含稳定行为模式的运动区域学习，抑制对易受协变量影响的静态区域的关注。

Result: GaitRDAE在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自动搜索运动区域、分配自适应时间尺度和应用相应注意力，有效提升了步态识别的准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个无需训练的方法，通过重新加权视觉token、引入噪声token和应用对抗攻击来缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，即生成看似合理但不准确的物体描述。与之前关注LLM组件的研究不同，本文首次将幻觉问题追溯到视觉编码器，并识别出三个关键问题：统计偏差、固有偏差和脆弱性。

Method: 提出SHIELD框架，包含三种策略：1) 重新加权视觉token以减少统计偏差；2) 引入噪声衍生token来对抗固有偏差；3) 应用对抗攻击和对比解码来解决脆弱性问题。

Result: 实验表明SHIELD能有效缓解多种基准测试和LVLM家族中的物体幻觉问题，并在通用LVLM基准上表现出色，证明其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个无需训练的有效框架，能够显著缓解LVLM中的物体幻觉问题，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionSelector是一个轻量级即插即用的视觉token压缩框架，通过可学习的评分模块和可微Top-K机制，实现高效自适应的token选择，显著提升多模态大语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理高分辨率图像或多图像输入时面临大量视觉token带来的计算和内存瓶颈，现有token压缩技术受限于启发式规则，存在信息丢失和性能下降的风险。

Method: 提出VisionSelector框架，包含与MLLM主干解耦的评分模块，采用可微Top-K机制和课程退火策略，实现端到端可学习的token压缩决策过程。

Result: 仅需12.85M可训练参数，在MME基准上30%保留预算下保持100%准确率，在10%保留预算下比先前方法提升12.14%，预填充速度提升一倍。

Conclusion: VisionSelector提供了一种高效、自适应的token压缩解决方案，在各种压缩率下都能保持优越性能，显著提升MLLM的推理效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is
available at https://github.com/JulietChoo/VisionSelector .

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and
susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing
techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for
real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a
deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to

Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%,
segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Conclusion: 该工作推进了结构化环境中基于视觉的无人机导航实践，解决了度量深度估计和计算效率挑战，可在资源受限平台上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiVerse是一个新颖的多轮对话基准测试，包含647个对话，涵盖12个流行VLM评估基准的484个任务，用于评估视觉语言模型在复杂多轮对话中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮对话数据集（如MMDU、ConvBench）未能充分捕捉用户在实际应用中遇到的广泛和深入的对话场景，需要更全面的评估基准来测试VLMs的多轮交互能力。

Method: 从12个流行VLM评估基准中提取647个对话，每个对话平均4轮，提出基于检查表的评估方法，使用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，测量37个关键方面的表现。

Result: 评估18个VLMs发现，即使最强模型（如GPT-4o）在复杂多轮对话中也仅达到50%的成功率，提供完整对话上下文能显著提升较小或较弱模型的性能。

Conclusion: MultiVerse是评估VLMs多轮交互能力的全面基准，揭示了当前模型在多轮对话中的局限性，并强调了上下文学习的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出使用检索增强生成方法，通过图数据库和Cypher查询语言作为LLM工具，来解决大型3D场景图在语言理解中的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D场景图序列化为文本放入LLM上下文窗口，但这种方法无法扩展到大型或丰富的3D场景图。需要一种更高效的连接自然语言与机器人世界表示的方法。

Method: 使用检索增强生成方法，将3D场景图编码到图数据库中，为LLM提供Cypher查询语言作为工具，使其能够检索与任务相关的数据。

Result: 在指令跟随和场景问答任务上的评估表明，使用Cypher作为3D场景图接口的方法在本地和云端模型上都能显著扩展到大型丰富图结构，同时大幅减少场景图内容的token数量。

Conclusion: Cypher作为3D场景图接口的方法在语言基础任务中实现了大规模性能提升，同时有效解决了扩展性问题。

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

TL;DR: 提出了针对病理学基础模型的通用可转移对抗攻击UTAP，这是一种固定且微弱的噪声模式，能够系统性地破坏多个病理学基础模型的特征表示能力，导致下游任务性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示病理学基础模型的关键脆弱性，建立高标准的模型鲁棒性评估基准，推动防御机制发展，确保AI在病理学中的安全可靠部署。

Method: 使用深度学习优化生成固定的微弱噪声模式UTAP，该模式可添加到病理图像中，系统性地破坏多个病理学基础模型的特征表示能力。

Result: UTAP在多个最先进的病理学基础模型上进行了系统评估，导致其性能显著下降，且对输入图像的视觉修改几乎不可察觉。UTAP具有通用性和可转移性，能够跨不同视野和数据集应用，并能成功降低各种外部黑盒病理学基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: UTAP构成了对各种新兴病理学基础模型及其应用的广泛威胁，其开发为模型鲁棒性评估建立了关键的高标准基准，强调了推进防御机制的必要性，并可能为对抗训练提供必要资源。

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

Method: 提出双智能体框架：感知智能体使用感知工具箱程序化查询3D场景提取充分信息，包括新颖的SOG模块；推理智能体迭代优化信息追求最小化，在闭环中剪枝冗余细节并请求缺失信息，直到构建出最小充分集。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了3D空间推理性能，还产生了可解释的推理路径，为未来模型提供了高质量训练数据来源。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

Result: 在IEEE SPS VIP Cup真实世界数据集上验证，通过CNR、MSR、TP和EP等指标显示性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法在仅有噪声OCT图像的情况下有效提升图像质量，具有临床应用的潜力

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Conclusion: DCCL通过增强跨领域概念连接性，有效解决了领域泛化问题，证明了类内连接性在领域泛化中的重要性。

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code
are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL

Conclusion: HumanCM证明了通过一致性模型实现高效单步人体运动预测的可行性，在保持精度的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while
reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的端到端自动驾驶系统依赖视觉中心的世界模型，但存在完全重建未来场景的无效性，这会耗费大量能力在冗余建模静态背景上。

Method: IR-WM首先从视觉观察建立鲁棒的鸟瞰图表示，然后利用前一时刻的BEV特征作为强时间先验，仅预测基于自车动作和场景上下文的"残差"变化，并应用对齐模块来校准语义和动态错位。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，IR-WM在4D占用预测和轨迹规划方面都取得了顶级性能。

Conclusion: 通过隐式残差建模和不同的预测-规划耦合方案，世界模型生成的隐式未来状态显著提高了规划准确性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

TL;DR: 提出UKANFormer模型，在Allen Coral Atlas噪声标签下实现高精度珊瑚礁语义分割，挑战了数据质量直接限制模型性能的传统观念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球珊瑚礁分布产品如Allen Coral Atlas存在空间精度和语义一致性不足的问题，特别是在需要精细边界划分的区域，需要开发能在噪声监督下实现高精度映射的模型。

Method: 基于UKAN架构，在解码器中引入全局-局部变换器(GLT)块，同时提取全局语义结构和局部边界细节，在噪声标签下进行训练。

Result: 珊瑚类IoU达到67.00%，像素精度83.98%，优于传统基线模型，预测结果在视觉和结构上比训练用的噪声标签更准确。

Conclusion: 架构设计可以缓解标签噪声，支持在非完美监督下进行可扩展映射，为生态监测提供了可靠标签稀缺情况下的解决方案。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)
Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference
Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature
Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We
systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time
control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal
consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated

TL;DR: 研究表明，离散的自回归视觉模型比连续扩散模型更适合推理时搜索优化，束搜索能显著提升文本到图像生成质量，让小模型超越大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然推理时搜索在语言模型中取得突破，但在图像生成领域应用有限，扩散模型的搜索策略效果不佳，需要探索更适合视觉生成模型的搜索方法。

Method: 使用离散自回归视觉模型，应用束搜索策略进行文本到图像生成，通过早期剪枝和计算重用来优化推理过程。

Result: 2B参数的自回归模型通过束搜索在多个基准测试中超越了12B参数的扩散模型，验证了离散token空间对搜索优化的优势。

Conclusion: 模型架构（而不仅仅是规模）对视觉生成的推理时优化至关重要，离散自回归模型更适合搜索策略的应用。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于人类感知的SR伪影显著性评估方法，构建了包含1302个伪影示例的数据集，并训练了轻量级回归器来生成空间显著性热图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式图像超分辨率模型能力的增强，它们产生伪影的趋势也在增加。这些伪影对人类感知的影响各不相同，有些几乎不可察觉，而有些则严重降低图像质量。因此需要基于人类感知的显著性来评估伪影，而不是将其视为统一的二元缺陷。

Method: 构建了包含1302个来自11种当代图像SR方法的伪影示例数据集，每个伪影都配有众包显著性评分。基于此数据集训练了一个轻量级回归器来生成空间显著性热图。

Result: 训练出的回归器在检测显著伪影方面优于现有方法，能够有效识别对人类感知影响较大的伪影。

Conclusion: 该方法为SR伪影的显著性感知评估和缓解提供了有效工具，发布了数据集和代码以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法在恢复精细纹理细节方面存在挑战，受限于小感受野和缺乏通道特征建模。

Method: 使用全局多尺度小波变换卷积(GMWTConvs)扩大感受野，Mamba通道感知模块(MCAM)捕获长程依赖，多尺度纹理增强损失(MTELoss)指导纹理保留。

Result: 大量实验证实WaMaIR优于最先进方法，实现更好的图像恢复效果和高效计算性能。

Conclusion: WaMaIR框架通过扩大感受野和增强通道建模，有效提升了图像恢复中纹理细节的重建质量。

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

TL;DR: 提出Region in Context框架，通过多级语义对齐实现文本条件图像编辑，确保局部编辑与全局上下文的一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图像区域孤立处理，仅依赖局部线索，导致编辑不一致、过渡不自然或整体连贯性丧失

Method: 引入双级引导机制：区域在全图上下文中表示并与详细区域级描述对齐，同时整图与视觉语言模型生成的场景级描述匹配

Result: 实验表明该方法能产生更连贯且与指令对齐的结果

Conclusion: 通过多级语义对齐和双级引导机制，实现了更精确和协调的图像编辑

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了EMRRG框架，使用预训练的Mamba网络和参数高效微调方法进行X射线医疗报告生成，在三个基准数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗报告生成模型主要依赖大语言模型，对预训练视觉基础模型和先进微调技术探索有限，主流框架要么避免微调要么使用简单方法如LoRA，忽略了增强交叉注意力机制的潜力，同时非Transformer架构如Mamba网络在医疗报告生成中尚未充分探索。

Method: 将X射线图像分割成块并标记化，通过SSM基础的视觉骨干进行特征提取，使用Partial LoRA实现最优性能，结合具有混合解码器的大语言模型生成医疗报告，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准数据集上进行了广泛实验，充分验证了所提出策略对X射线医疗报告生成的有效性。

Conclusion: EMRRG框架通过微调预训练Mamba网络和使用参数高效方法，在X射线医疗报告生成任务上取得了优异表现，为非Transformer架构在医疗视觉语言任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法通常通过建立2D图像特征与3D模型特征之间的对应关系来预测姿态，但在纹理缺失物体和变化光照条件下表现不佳。

Method: 提出GS2POSE方法，基于束调整原理设计姿态回归算法，利用李代数扩展3DGS能力构建姿态可微渲染管道，通过比较输入图像与渲染图像迭代优化姿态，同时更新3DGS模型中的颜色参数以适应光照变化。

Result: 在T-LESS、LineMod-Occlusion和LineMod数据集上分别实现了1.4%、2.8%和2.5%的精度提升。

Conclusion: GS2POSE通过结合3D高斯散射和束调整原理，有效解决了纹理缺失和光照变化下的6D姿态估计问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了优于现有方法的表现。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在静态图像上的零样本推理能力尚未充分应用于视频领域，而传统视频理解模型依赖大量标注数据和任务特定训练，成本高且可扩展性有限。

Method: 首先使用预训练VLM的冻结视觉编码器将视频流转换为语义特征轨迹，然后使用核时间分割(KTS)将连续特征流分割为离散的语义连贯事件片段，最后通过无监督密度聚类识别视频中的重复宏观场景和主题。

Result: 从每个发现的聚类中选择代表性关键帧，并利用VLM的生成能力进行文本描述，自动生成视频内容的结构化多模态摘要。

Conclusion: 该方法为零样本、自动化的视频内容结构分析提供了一条有效、可解释且模型无关的途径。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

TL;DR: LENS是一个新颖的即插即用解决方案，通过在冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头部，利用注意力图中的空间线索提取关键点，实现像素级分割，同时保持模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法需要微调模型以产生与掩码解码器兼容的输出，这会改变模型的输出空间并损害其内在泛化能力，违背了构建统一模型的目标。

Method: LENS在完全冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头部，通过精炼注意力图中的空间线索来提取关键点，并将这些关键点描述为与掩码解码器直接兼容的点级特征。

Result: LENS实现了与基于重训练方法相当或更优的分割性能，同时完全保留了MLLM的泛化能力，而微调方法会显著降低这种能力。

Conclusion: LENS的可附加设计为扩展MLLM建立了一个高效且强大的范式，为构建真正多才多艺的统一模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除对昂贵人工标注数据集的依赖，为自动驾驶提供可扩展的无监督道路分割解决方案。

Method: 首先基于几何先验生成弱标签（地平线上方为非道路，车辆前方四边形为道路），然后通过跨帧跟踪局部特征点并使用互信息最大化来强制执行时间一致性。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上实现了0.82的交并比(IoU)，表现出高精度和简单设计。

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和时间一致性为自动驾驶中的可扩展无监督道路分割展示了巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 摄影风格作为摄影概念的组合，是著名摄影师魅力的来源。但学习和转移摄影风格需要对照片从原始外观到编辑后的变化有深刻理解。现有方法要么无法从参考图像中学习有意义的摄影概念，要么无法保留内容图像的内容。

Method: 基于预训练的文本到图像扩散模型，利用生成先验学习摄影概念的平均外观以及如何根据文本提示调整它们。通过文本反转技术优化摄影概念的提示来学习参考图像的摄影风格。

Result: PIF在提取和转移各种摄影风格方面表现出色。

Conclusion: PIF能够有效解决摄影风格学习和转移的问题，展示了在多种摄影风格处理上的优秀性能。

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple
lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset
encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images,
consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth

Motivation: 由于气候变化等人为压力导致珊瑚礁快速衰退，迫切需要可扩展的自动化监测方法。现有数据集在规模、地理范围或标签粒度方面存在局限，且不适用于机器学习。

Method: 整合了76个CoralNet来源和红海Al Wajh站点的图像，提供细粒度、分类学映射的标签。提出了两种评估设置：源内基准测试和跨源基准测试，分别测试局部性能和领域泛化能力。

Result: 监督学习在源内表现良好，但在跨域时性能急剧下降；零样本模型在所有情况下表现均较差，特别是对于稀有和视觉相似属。

Conclusion: ReefNet提供了一个具有挑战性的基准，旨在推动领域泛化和细粒度珊瑚分类的进展，将发布数据集、基准代码和预训练模型以支持全球珊瑚礁监测和保护。

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，通过纹理特征预测木屑水分含量，解决不同来源木屑数据分布变化问题，准确率提升23%达到80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有木屑水分预测方法存在局限性：直接方法耗时且破坏样本，间接方法在不同来源木屑上准确性不足。需要一种能有效应对来源变异性的稳健方法。

Method: 综合分析五种纹理特征，提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，利用纹理特征在不同域间传递知识，并基于调整互信息提出模型保存准则。

Result: 组合所有五种纹理特征达到95%准确率；AdaptMoist方法将跨域预测准确率从57%提升至80%，提高23%。

Conclusion: AdaptMoist是跨域木屑水分含量估计的有效稳健解决方案，对依赖木屑的产业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

TL;DR: 提出M2HVideo框架，将假人视频转换为身份可控、逼真的人类视频，解决头部身体运动不对齐和身份漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假人服装展示成本低但缺乏真实感和表现细节，需要将假人视频转换为逼真的人类视频。

Method: 使用动态姿态感知头部编码器融合面部语义和身体姿态，引入镜像损失和分布感知适配器增强时间一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，M2HVideo在服装一致性、身份保持和视频保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M2HVideo框架成功解决了假人到人类视频生成的关键挑战，实现了高质量的视频转换。

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 2DGS-R通过分层训练方法，在保持几何精度的同时提升渲染质量，仅需1%额外存储和少量训练时间即可实现高质量渲染效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)渲染质量高但难以准确表示表面，而2DGS几何保真度好但渲染质量受损，目前无法在单阶段训练中同时优化几何和渲染质量。

Method: 采用分层训练：首先用法向一致性正则化训练原始2D高斯；然后选择渲染质量不足的2D高斯进行原地克隆操作；最后冻结不透明度微调模型。

Result: 相比原始2DGS仅需1%额外存储和少量训练时间，实现了高质量渲染结果同时保留精细几何结构。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了效率与性能，在视觉保真度和几何重建精度方面均有提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 武器相关暴力威胁日益严重，需要能够进行像素级精确检测的自动化系统。传统方法只能提供粗略的边界框定位，缺乏细粒度分割能力，而现有语义分割模型要么牺牲精度换取效率，要么计算资源需求过高不适合边缘部署。

Conclusion: ArmFormer是部署在便携安全摄像头、监控无人机和嵌入式AI加速器上的最优解决方案，在分布式安全基础设施中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in
distributed security infrastructure.

*Shujian Gao,Yuan Wang,Zekuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BARL是一个半监督医学图像分割框架，通过在表示空间和标签空间进行双边对齐，显著提升分割性能并减少标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督医学图像分割方法主要关注标签空间一致性，但忽视了表示空间对齐的重要性，导致模型难以学习具有区分性和空间一致性的特征表示。

Method: 提出BARL框架，包含两个协作分支：1）标签空间对齐：通过双路径正则化和渐进认知偏差校正实现细粒度跨分支一致性；2）表示空间对齐：在分支间进行区域级和病灶实例级匹配，捕捉医学图像中常见的碎片化复杂病理模式。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集和一个私有CBCT数据集上的实验表明，BARL始终优于最先进的半监督医学图像分割方法。消融研究进一步验证了各组件的贡献。

Conclusion: BARL通过双边对齐策略有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，证明了在表示空间和标签空间同时进行对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: 当前基于内存库的3D异常检测方法存在特征变换不一致和判别能力有限的问题，特别是在捕捉局部几何细节和实现旋转不变性方面。当配准失败时，这些限制会导致不可靠的检测结果。

Method: 提出配准诱导的旋转不变特征提取框架，将点云配准目标与基于内存的异常检测相结合。通过将特征提取嵌入到配准学习过程中，联合优化对齐和表示学习。

Result: 在Anomaly-ShapeNet和Real3D-AD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在有效性和泛化性方面始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 点云配准在引导特征提取朝向旋转不变和局部判别表示方面起着关键作用，所提出的框架能够获得对旋转鲁棒且对异常检测高度有效的特征。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经元级别的分析框架，通过人类大脑活动研究视觉语言模型中的多模态信息处理机制，揭示了ANNs与生物神经元在功能网络、冗余性、极性模式和架构影响方面的相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对人工神经网络与人类大脑处理之间相似性的理解有限：单模态ANN研究无法捕捉大脑固有的多模态处理能力，而多模态ANN研究主要关注高层模型输出，忽略了单个神经元的关键作用。

Method: 结合细粒度人工神经元分析和基于fMRI的体素编码，研究了两种架构不同的视觉语言模型（CLIP和METER），通过神经元级别分析框架来研究多模态信息处理机制。

Result: 发现四个关键结果：ANNs能成功预测多个功能网络中生物神经元的活动；ANNs和BNs都表现出功能冗余；ANNs展示与BNs平行的极性模式；CLIP和METER的架构驱动不同的BNs活动模式。

Conclusion: 这些结果为视觉语言模型中存在类似大脑的层次处理提供了有力证据，表明在神经元级别上存在共享的表征机制和相似的信息处理特性。

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

Conclusion: Edit-R1是一个模型无关的后训练框架，能显著提升指令图像编辑模型的性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空业的非CO2效应（特别是凝结尾迹）对气候变化有显著影响，但验证物理模型需要将观测到的凝结尾迹与生成它们的航班关联起来。卫星归因由于空间和时间分辨率有限而具有挑战性。

Method: 利用地面可见相机凝结尾迹序列数据集，开发模块化框架，将地面相机观测的凝结尾迹与基于飞机监视和气象数据推导的理论凝结尾迹进行关联。框架支持多种几何表示和距离度量，包含时间平滑，并支持基于概率的灵活分配策略。

Conclusion: 地面相机方法在凝结尾迹归因方面具有优势，特别是在凝结尾迹形成初期保持细长线性且视觉上可区分时，为凝结尾迹归因研究提供了可靠的基础。

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The
transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for
weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible
accuracy-speed trade-offs suitable for diverse real-time security applications.

We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Motivation: 扩散和流模型生成质量高但计算成本大，现有蒸馏方法缺乏统一的理论基础。

Method: 将扩散蒸馏表述为Bregman散度密度比匹配问题，提供凸分析视角统一多种现有目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和文生图任务上，相比反向KL蒸馏获得更好的一步FID，保持与教师模型相近的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Bregman密度比匹配是通向高效一步扩散生成的实际且理论可靠的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain
computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods
accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward
efficient one-step diffusion generation.

Motivation: 现有ADL识别方法存在表示级限制：序列方法保持时间顺序但对噪声敏感且缺乏空间意识；图像方法捕获全局模式但压缩时间动态；简单融合方法无法实现表示视图间的对齐

Method: CARE框架包含：时间感知、抗噪声的序列编码；空间感知和频率敏感的图像表示；联合对比-分类目标进行端到端学习，通过序列-图像对比对齐确保跨表示对齐和任务特定可区分性

Conclusion: CARE框架通过对比对齐有效结合序列和图像表示的互补优势，为智能家居中可靠的ADL识别提供了潜力

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

Conclusion: BaGLM证明了利用大型多模态模型实现高效在线视频步骤定位的可行性，无需任务特定训练。

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

Motivation: 当前时序视频定位研究过于集中在少数几种视频表示方法上，可能导致架构过拟合。为解决这一问题，作者希望研究不同视频特征对经典架构的影响。

Method: 在三个基准数据集(Charades-STA、ActivityNet-Captions和YouCookII)上，使用基于CNN、时序推理和transformer的视频编码器提取特征，并进行对比分析。

Conclusion: 不同视频特征之间存在显著的性能差异，表明特征互补具有潜在价值，这为未来研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Motivation: 验证专用遥感基础模型是否真的比通用视觉基础模型更有用，特别是在小规模情况下，因为遥感图像具有独特特征和特定应用需求。

Method: 设计了一个简单基准测试来衡量遥感模型在低分辨率图像上的泛化能力；在MillionAID数据集上训练iBOT自监督视觉编码器，并针对遥感进行特定修改。

Conclusion: 在ViT-B规模下，专用遥感基础模型并不比通用视觉基础模型更有优势。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Motivation: 利用多模态LLM的能力联合处理文本和视频，有效定位视频中的自然语言查询，解决直接定位中的信息缺失问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先将语言查询转换为包含缺失细节和线索的增强句子，然后使用轻量级解码器基于增强查询的上下文表示预测准确边界。使用多实例学习目标动态选择最佳查询版本以减少噪声和幻觉影响。

Result: 在时序视频定位和段落定位的各种基准测试中达到最先进水平，显著优于所有先前提出的基于LLM的时序定位方法，在零样本评估场景中具有明显优势。

Conclusion: ED-VTG方法在视频时序定位任务中表现出色，既优于或与专用模型相当，又在零样本评估中保持明显优势，证明了多模态LLM在细粒度视频理解任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出W2R2训练框架，通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制来解决多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏差问题，在不改变推理架构的情况下提升3D定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态3D定位模型存在严重的"2D语义偏差"，过度依赖2D图像特征进行粗略定位，而忽视3D几何输入，导致融合性能不佳。

Method: W2R2框架将2D特征指定为语义信标用于"是什么"识别，3D特征作为空间锚点用于"在哪里"定位，采用双目标损失函数：对齐损失通过适应交叉熵监督融合预测，伪标签损失通过基于边界的机制惩罚过度有效的2D主导伪输出。

Result: 在ScanRefer和ScanQA数据集上的实验表明，W2R2在定位精度和鲁棒性方面取得显著提升，特别是在杂乱户外场景中。

Conclusion: W2R2通过重新形成表示空间，有效解决了多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏差问题，实现了更精确的3D定位性能。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 肺癌是癌症死亡的主要原因，CT成像在筛查、预后和治疗中至关重要。手动分割存在变异性且耗时，深度学习虽然提供自动化但面临临床采用障碍。

Method: 使用来自12个公共数据集的999名患者的多中心CT数据，采用5种深度学习模型（3D Attention U-Net、ResUNet、VNet、ReconNet、SAM-Med3D），在完整图像和点击裁剪图像上对比专家轮廓。通过497个PySERA提取的放射组学特征评估分割可重复性，预后建模比较了监督学习和半监督学习，涉及38种降维策略和24种分类器。6名医生在7个领域对掩模进行定性评估。

Result: VNet实现了最佳性能（Dice = 0.83，IoU = 0.71）、放射组学稳定性（平均相关性 = 0.76，ICC = 0.65）和SSL下的预测准确性（准确率 = 0.88，F1 = 0.83）。SSL在所有模型中始终优于SL。放射科医生更青睐VNet的瘤周表示和平滑边界，倾向于使用AI生成的初始掩模进行精炼而非替换。

Conclusion: 将VNet与SSL结合可产生准确、可重复且临床可信的基于CT的肺癌预后结果，为以医生为中心的AI转化提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Motivation: 现有视频推理LMM依赖昂贵的RL训练和冗长的思维链，计算开销大且推理过程控制机制有限。

Method: 使用模型输出熵作为信号，通过小型可训练控制器优化LMM的值缓存，基于熵目标调整推理过程中的微观探索和利用行为。

Conclusion: 基于熵的推理过程优化可有效提升LMM视频推理性能，无需额外训练即可获得接近RL模型的准确率，同时大幅提升效率。

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Motivation: 理解通用基础视觉模型与专用模型之间的权衡对于高效特征编码设计至关重要，但目前尚未完全理解

Method: 使用轻量可训练neck层来探测冻结特征的适应性，通过信息论成本量化专业化代价，并进行跨neck分析

Result: SAM2在空间相关任务(如深度估计)上表现优异，但在概念较远任务(如姿态估计、图像描述)上不如通用模型Hiera，显示出语义信息损失

Conclusion: 专业化虽然有效但会带来表征瓶颈，为设计高效特征编码和适应策略提供了量化基础

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their
specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is
not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the
feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a

TL;DR: 提出ProDAT方法，通过密度感知的尾丢弃机制实现点云的渐进式编码，在单一模型中支持多比特率解码，显著提升了编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云在自动驾驶、增强现实等应用中需要实时处理和低延迟，但大数据量和带宽限制阻碍了在资源受限环境中的高质量服务部署。现有学习型点云几何编码方法的固定潜在表示不支持渐进式解码。

Method: 提出ProDAT方法，利用密度信息作为指导信号，根据重要性自适应解码潜在特征和坐标，实现单一模型支持多比特率的渐进式解码。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，ProDAT不仅实现了渐进式编码，还在编码效率上优于最先进的学习型编码技术，在SemanticKITTI上PSNR-D2的BD-rate提升超过28.6%，在ShapeNet上提升超过18.15%。

Conclusion: ProDAT通过密度感知的渐进式编码机制，有效解决了点云编码中的渐进解码问题，同时显著提升了编码性能。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

TL;DR: 提出了FMCAF预处理架构，通过频域滤波和跨注意力融合来增强RGB和红外图像的多模态目标检测性能，在多个数据集上优于传统融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态目标检测在挑战性条件下通过利用多个传感器模态的互补线索来提高鲁棒性，但现有方法往往缺乏通用性。

Method: FMCAF结合频域滤波块（Freq-Filter）来抑制冗余频谱特征，以及基于跨注意力的融合模块（MCAF）来改善模态间特征共享。

Result: 在LLVIP（低光行人检测）和VEDAI（航空车辆检测）数据集上，FMCAF优于传统融合方法，在VEDAI上mAP@50提升13.9%，在LLVIP上提升1.1%。

Conclusion: FMCAF作为灵活的基础架构，在未来的多模态检测流程中具有强大的融合潜力，无需特定数据集调优即可提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

TL;DR: GSPlane是一个改进高斯溅射(3D重建技术)的方法，通过引入平面先验来提升平面区域的几何精度和网格质量，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法在重建平面区域时存在平滑度和精度不足的问题，而平面是3D场景中的重要元素，特别是在人造环境中。

Method: 利用现成的分割和法线预测模型提取平面先验，建立结构化表示；引入动态高斯重分类器优化训练；使用优化后的平面先验改进网格布局。

Result: 在保持渲染质量的同时，显著提高了提取网格的几何精度，减少了顶点和面的数量，改善了拓扑结构。

Conclusion: GSPlane通过平面先验有效提升了高斯溅射在平面重建方面的性能，并支持场景编辑和物理模拟等下游应用。

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散方法在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但往往以牺牲内容保真度为代价来获得更高的感知真实感，特别是在低光照场景下，黑暗导致的严重信息退化限制了有效控制。

Method: 引入潜在精炼管道恢复VAE编码过程中丢失的空间细节，并通过动态双向交互机制让精炼后的潜在条件与噪声潜在进行交互，提升恢复性能。

Conclusion: 该方法即插即用，可无缝集成到现有扩散网络中提供更有效的控制，在保持真实感和美学的同时显著改善内容保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

Motivation: 开发一种能够在不干扰人类视觉体验的前提下，为视频内容嵌入隐私保护和内容验证元数据的技术。

Method: 采用光谱调制而非强度调制，联合考虑人眼视觉系统敏感性、消费级相机传感器光谱灵敏度以及窄带LED生成宽带白光的能力，优化LED光源的光谱特性。

Result: 能够在标准低帧率（30-60 fps）下提取水印，在10秒视频片段中嵌入128位信息，足以支持隐私保护和内容验证所需的元数据。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对人眼不可见但对相机可检测的水印嵌入，为视频内容的隐私保护和认证提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过扰动文本条件嵌入生成OOD样本，存在语义不稳定和多样性不足的问题，限制了在真实OOD场景中的泛化能力

Method: GOOD框架包含双重引导：图像级引导基于对数分割梯度降低输入似然，特征级引导基于k-NN距离在分类器潜在空间中促进稀疏区域采样

Result: 训练使用GOOD生成的样本能显著提升OOD检测性能，通过定量和定性分析验证了有效性

Conclusion: GOOD提供了一种可控且多样化的OOD样本生成方法，通过统一OOD评分增强了检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Conclusion: KineDiff3D框架有效解决了铰接物体的3D重建和姿态估计问题，通过统一的运动学感知方法实现了高质量的重建结果。

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

Conclusion: GACO-CAD通过结合几何先验和简洁性奖励，有效提升了从单张图像生成可编辑CAD模型的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

Motivation: 掩码自回归模型在视觉生成中具有并行生成能力，但其加速潜力受到单步中空间相关视觉标记建模复杂性的限制。

Method: 提出GtR策略，将生成分解为结构生成（建立全局语义框架）和细节重建（高效完成剩余标记）两个阶段，并引入频率加权标记选择来为图像细节分配更多计算资源。

Conclusion: GtR在各种模型规模和生成任务中显著优于现有加速方法，为掩码自回归模型提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 现有GCD方法假设训练时能同时访问标记和未标记数据且来自同一领域，限制了在涉及分布偏移的开放世界场景中的适用性。DG-GCD要求模型泛化到包含新类别的未见领域，而无需在训练时访问目标领域数据。

Method: 使用GPT引导的扩散进行源领域增强，引入切线CutMix进行曲率感知插值，结合惩罚Busemann对齐、混合双曲对比正则化和自适应离群排斥的统一损失函数，以及可学习的曲率参数。

Conclusion: HIDISC通过双曲表示学习有效解决了DG-GCD问题，在不使用情景模拟的情况下实现了领域和类别级泛化，计算效率高且性能优越。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知视觉令牌剪枝方法能有效平衡任务相关性和信息多样性，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

*M Saifuzzaman Rafat,Mohd Ruhul Ameen,Akif Islam,Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Jungpil Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文展示了如何将通用视觉模型SAM（Segment Anything Model）应用于孟加拉国河流侵蚀监测，通过构建包含消失定居点标注的新数据集，并微调SAM模型，实现了对河流侵蚀的高精度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国的河流既是交通和生计的动脉，也是持续破坏的媒介，每年吞噬村庄和农田，导致数千家庭流离失所。传统人工监测这一缓慢灾害极为困难。

Method: 首先使用简单的颜色通道分析进行粗略的土地和水域分割，然后微调SAM的掩码解码器以识别河岸侵蚀的细微特征。构建了包含2003-2025年孟加拉国脆弱地区Google Earth影像的新数据集，首次包含消失定居点的手动标注。

Result: 最终模型在河流侵蚀检测上表现出色，平均IoU达到86.30%，Dice分数达到92.60%，显著超越传统方法和现成的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了三个关键贡献：首个因河流侵蚀而消失定居点的标注数据集；专门为此关键任务微调的AI模型；以及通过视觉证据量化土地损失的方法，为政策制定者和灾害管理机构提供了监测侵蚀、预测轨迹和保护脆弱社区的有力工具。

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

TL;DR: 基于TimeSformer视频识别模型，通过分析VALORANT游戏小地图中的战术特征（如角色位置和游戏事件）来预测回合结果，在增强数据集上达到约81%的预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电竞比赛结果预测研究多基于比赛日志和统计数据，但针对需要复杂策略的FPS游戏VALORANT，希望通过分析比赛录像中的小地图信息来构建更准确的回合结果预测模型。

Method: 基于TimeSformer视频识别模型，从小地图信息中提取详细的战术特征，包括角色位置信息和游戏内事件，构建增强数据集进行训练。

Result: 在增强战术事件标签的数据集上训练的模型达到约81%的预测准确率，特别是在回合中后期阶段，显著优于仅使用小地图信息本身训练的模型。

Conclusion: 利用比赛录像中的战术特征对于预测VALORANT回合结果非常有效，尤其是在回合中后期能够显著提高预测准确性。

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

TL;DR: EndoCIL是一个专门为内窥镜图像诊断设计的类增量学习框架，通过三个关键组件解决领域差异和类别不平衡问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像分析需要模型能够持续适应新的临床数据，同时保持对已学习类别的性能。现有基于回放的类增量学习方法由于内窥镜图像中严重的领域差异和类别不平衡问题，无法有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: EndoCIL包含三个核心组件：1) MDBR：基于最大均值差异的回放策略，选择多样化和代表性的样本；2) PRCBL：先验正则化类别平衡损失，缓解阶段间和阶段内的类别不平衡；3) CFG：全连接梯度校准，调整分类器梯度以减少对新类别的偏置。

Result: 在四个公共内窥镜数据集上的广泛实验表明，EndoCIL在不同缓冲区大小和评估指标下普遍优于最先进的类增量学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了终身内窥镜诊断中的稳定性和可塑性，显示出良好的临床可扩展性和部署潜力。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统容易受到欺骗攻击，恶意用户可能使用注册用户的照片绕过认证，因此需要在人脸识别前检测欺骗攻击。

Method: 使用带注册机制的DINOv2模型提取泛化特征，抑制注意力机制中的扰动，专注于关键细微特征来区分真实和欺骗人脸图像。

Result: 在ICCV2025第六届人脸反欺骗研讨会数据集和SiW数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于DINOv2的欺骗攻击检测方法能够有效识别真实和欺骗人脸图像，为人脸识别系统提供安全保障。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

TL;DR: VisiPruner是一个无需训练的剪枝框架，通过分析MLLMs的三阶段跨模态交互过程，能够减少高达99%的视觉相关注意力计算和53.9%的FLOPs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但由于注意力计算的二次增长导致计算开销巨大。现有方法缺乏对MLLMs如何处理和融合多模态信息的基本理解。

Method: 通过系统分析发现MLLMs的三阶段跨模态交互过程：浅层识别任务意图、中层发生跨模态融合、深层仅关注语言精炼。基于此提出VisiPruner框架，在关键融合层保留少量视觉token，其他层大幅剪枝。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5 7B上减少99%视觉相关注意力计算和53.9% FLOPs，显著优于现有token剪枝方法，并能在多种MLLMs上泛化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs的层间处理动态，为训练高效MLLMs提供了可操作的指导原则，通过使模型架构与其内在处理动态对齐来提升效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多时刻检索(MMR)任务，构建了QV-M²数据集和新的评估指标，并开发了FlashMMR框架来改进多时刻边界检测，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法专注于单时刻检索，但现实应用中一个查询可能对应多个相关时刻，现有数据集和方法不足以应对视频时序定位的实际需求。

Method: 提出FlashMMR框架，包含多时刻后验证模块，通过约束时序调整和验证模块重新评估候选片段，通过精细过滤管道修剪低置信度提议，实现鲁棒的多时刻对齐。

Result: 在QV-M²数据集上，FlashMMR相比之前SOTA方法在G-mAP提升3.00%，mAP@3+tgt提升2.70%，mR@3提升2.56%。

Conclusion: QV-M²数据集和FlashMMR方法为推进更现实和具有挑战性的视频时序定位场景研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法存在偏见、缺乏透明度且无法捕捉时序信息，导致跨不同人口群体的决策偏见和不可靠结果。

Method: 使用时序建模进行深度伪造视频分析，结合概念提取提升检测可靠性；引入人口统计感知数据增强方法，平衡代表性不足群体并应用频域变换保留伪造伪影。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解偏见，提高泛化能力，并为非专家用户提供可解释的决策。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented
landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce
FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Conclusion: PnF方法通过自然语言描述复杂场景，有效提升了运动预测性能，且无需微调，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving

conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world
scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

Motivation: 观察到自监督学习在密集预测任务中存在的性能退化现象，需要无标注评估密集任务性能的方法。

Method: 提出Dense representation Structure Estimator (DSE)，包含类相关性度量和有效维度度量，用于模型选择和正则化。

Result: 在16种SSL方法和4个基准测试中，模型选择平均提升mIoU 3.0%，DSE正则化有效缓解密集退化。

Conclusion: DSE指标能有效评估自监督学习在密集任务上的性能，提出的策略能显著改善模型表现。

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and
Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance
Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality
assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized

face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and
long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the
information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset

### [133] [CausalMamba: Scalable Conditional State Space Models for Neural Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17318)
*Sangyoon Bae,Jiook Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalMamba是一个可扩展的fMRI因果推断框架，解决了从血氧信号推断神经因果关系的病态问题和现有方法的计算不可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI因果推断的两个基本限制：从血氧动力学扭曲的BOLD信号推断神经因果关系的病态性质，以及现有方法（如动态因果建模）的计算不可行性。

Method: 将复杂逆问题分解为两个可处理阶段：BOLD反卷积恢复潜在神经活动，然后使用新颖的条件Mamba架构进行因果图推断。

Result: 在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%；在真实任务fMRI数据中恢复已知神经通路的保真度达88%，而传统方法在99%以上受试者中无法识别这些典型回路。

Conclusion: 为神经科学家提供了大规模因果推断的实用工具，能够捕捉认知功能背后的基本回路模式和灵活网络动态。

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了对抗性衣物对现有防御方法的突破能力，发现简单的增大补丁尺寸就能使现有防御失效，而对抗性衣物不仅尺寸大且更自然，能有效测试防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁防御方法在面对大尺寸攻击时表现不佳，特别是对抗性衣物这种既大尺寸又自然的攻击形式，需要评估其防御效果。

Method: 通过制作对抗性衣物，在数字世界和物理世界中测试多种防御方法的效果，并针对Faster R-CNN制作单一衣物突破多种防御。

Result: 所有防御方法在对抗性衣物面前表现都很差，单一衣物在物理世界中对抗未防御检测器的攻击成功率达96.06%，对抗九个防御模型的攻击成功率均超过64.84%。

Conclusion: 现有对抗性防御方法在面对大尺寸、自然的对抗性衣物时存在共同漏洞，防御效果不佳。

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CharDiff框架，利用字符级引导的扩散模型恢复和识别严重退化的车牌图像，通过CHARM模块实现精确的区域化字符引导，在恢复质量和识别准确率上显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车牌图像恢复不仅对LPR系统预处理重要，还能提高证据价值、增强视觉界面清晰度和促进车牌图像的进一步利用。现有方法在处理现实条件下严重退化的车牌图像时效果有限。

Method: 提出CharDiff框架，利用外部分割和OCR模块提取细粒度字符级先验，通过CHARM模块实现字符引导注意力机制，确保每个字符的引导仅限于自身区域，避免区域间干扰。

Result: 在Roboflow-LP数据集上，CharDiff显著优于基线恢复模型，在恢复质量和识别准确率上都有提升，相比最佳基线模型实现了28%的相对CER降低。

Conclusion: 结构化的字符引导条件化有效增强了基于扩散的车牌恢复和识别在实际部署场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraCUA是一个基础模型，通过混合动作将GUI基本操作与高级程序化工具调用无缝集成，解决了计算机使用代理的视觉定位和执行链问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算机使用代理仅依赖基本操作（点击、输入、滚动），需要精确的视觉定位和冗长的执行链，导致级联失败和性能瓶颈。这些代理与其他利用丰富程序化接口的代理隔离。

Method: 方法包括四个关键组件：(1)从软件文档、开源仓库和代码生成中扩展程序化工具的自动化流水线；(2)生成超过17,000个可验证任务的合成数据引擎；(3)大规模高质量混合动作轨迹收集；(4)结合监督微调和在线强化学习的两阶段训练管道。

Result: 实验显示，7B和32B模型相比最先进代理有显著改进。在OSWorld上，UltraCUA模型相对基础模型平均提升22%，步骤减少11%。在WindowsAgentArena的域外评估中，成功率达到21.7%，优于在Windows数据上训练的基线。

Conclusion: 混合动作机制至关重要，减少了错误传播同时保持了执行效率，成功弥合了计算机使用代理与其他代理之间的能力差距。

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction
to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we
address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing
iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of
simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and
description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these
heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation
modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the
ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality
assessments.

TL;DR: Glyph框架通过将长文本渲染为图像，利用视觉语言模型处理，实现3-4倍文本压缩，在保持准确性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理百万级token长上下文时面临的计算和内存成本过高的问题。

Method: 将长文本渲染成图像，使用视觉语言模型处理，并设计基于LLM的遗传搜索来优化视觉渲染配置。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试中达到与Qwen3-8B相当的准确性，同时实现3-4倍token压缩、4倍推理速度和2倍训练速度提升。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文缩放是解决长上下文建模挑战的有效方法，能够显著降低计算成本并扩展处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于后处理的开放集识别方法，通过比较特征空间中的最近类均值分布与logit空间的softmax概率来检测未知类别，无需重新训练预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前野生动物分类模型在封闭世界设定下训练，面对未知类别时仍过度自信。现有OSR方法大多需要重新训练模型，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用后处理策略，计算输入特征到最近类均值的距离生成概率分布，然后与logit空间的softmax概率进行比较来衡量一致性。

Result: 在两个数据集上排名前三，AUROC分别达到93.41（非洲动物）和95.35（瑞典动物），性能表现稳定。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在无需重新训练的情况下实现了有效的开放集识别，性能优于现有方法且在不同数据集上表现一致。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

*Jingqian Wu,Shengpeng Xu,Yunbo Jia,Edmund Y. Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Semantic-E2VID框架，通过跨模态特征对齐和语义感知特征融合，将视觉语义知识从图像模态迁移到事件模态，显著提升了事件到视频重建的质量和语义信息恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机仅捕捉强度变化，忽略静态物体和背景，导致捕获的事件模态缺乏语义信息。现有的事件到视频重建方法往往忽视语义信息的重要性，而语义信息对视频重建至关重要。

Method: 1. 跨模态特征对齐模块将SAM模型的视觉语义知识迁移到事件编码器；2. 语义感知特征融合块整合学习到的语义特征；3. 语义感知E2V监督利用SAM生成的类别标签帮助重建语义细节。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了帧质量，优于最先进的事件到视频重建方法。

Conclusion: Semantic-E2VID通过引入语义信息有效解决了事件模态缺乏语义知识的问题，为事件到视频重建任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: M2H为动态环境中的3D场景图构建提供了实用的单目空间感知系统基础，并在真实世界数据上验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond
benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality
in spatial perception tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为视频大语言模型在流式场景中的应用提供了有效的训练免费解决方案，显著提升了处理效率。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries.
However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 合成人脸数据是科学上可行且伦理上必要的人脸识别研究替代方案，能够有效解决隐私保护和偏见缓解问题。

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于面部表情的PD诊断方法依赖单一表情类型易导致误诊，且忽略不同PD阶段的类别不平衡问题，大多数方法仅进行二元分类而非严重程度诊断。

Method: 集成多面部表情特征通过注意力机制进行特征融合，采用自适应类别平衡策略动态调整训练样本贡献度。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在PD严重程度诊断方面表现优异，注意力特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略有效。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效诊断PD严重程度，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过观察他人与物体交互就能学习新物体的使用方式，但现有弱监督感知基础方法仅从外中心图像单向转移到自我中心图像，限制了在复杂交互场景中的应用。

Method: 引入闭环框架LoopTrans，包含统一跨模态定位和去噪知识蒸馏机制，桥接物体中心的自我中心图像和交互中心的外中心图像之间的领域差距。

Result: 实验表明LoopTrans在所有图像和视频基准测试指标上均取得一致提升，甚至能处理人体完全遮挡物体交互区域的挑战性场景。

Conclusion: LoopTrans通过双向知识转移有效提升了感知基础性能，证明了闭环框架在复杂交互场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human
body.

*Dmitrii Galimzianov,Viacheslav Vyshegorodtsev,Ivan Nezhivykh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于视觉的马匹行为监测系统原型，使用YOLOv11和BoT-SORT进行检测和跟踪，能够自动识别马厩中的马匹和人员行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统马匹行为监测方法劳动密集且耗时，需要自动化系统来早期发现健康福利问题。

Method: 利用YOLOv11进行目标检测，BoT-SORT进行多目标跟踪，基于对象轨迹和空间关系推断事件状态，使用CLIP和GroundingDINO辅助构建自定义数据集。

Result: 系统能够区分五种事件类型并处理摄像头盲区，马匹相关事件检测可靠，但人员检测因数据不足存在局限。

Conclusion: 为马场实时行为监测奠定了基础，对动物福利和厩舍管理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

*Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen,Filza Khan Tareen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepDetect是一个智能的密集关键点检测器，通过融合7种关键点检测器和2种边缘检测器的输出来创建真实标签，训练轻量级ESPNet模型，在关键点密度、重复性和正确匹配数量方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关键点检测器对光照变化敏感、关键点密度低、重复性差、适应性有限且缺乏语义理解，无法优先处理视觉重要区域。

Method: 融合7种关键点检测器和2种边缘检测器的输出创建真实标签，使用这些标签训练轻量级ESPNet模型，使模型能够语义地关注图像并产生密集关键点。

Result: 在Oxford Affine Covariant Regions数据集上评估，DeepDetect在关键点密度(0.5143)、重复性(0.9582)和正确匹配数量(59,003)方面达到最大值，超越其他检测器。

Conclusion: DeepDetect通过深度学习统一经典检测器的优势，能够产生高度密集且适应性强的关键点，在各种视觉退化条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索压缩域对应关系作为资源高效的前端处理方案，减少计算资源消耗同时保持几何精度。

Method: 重新利用AV1运动向量生成密集亚像素对应关系，通过余弦一致性过滤短轨迹，在压缩域进行处理。

Result: 在117帧视频上成功注册所有图像并重建46-62万点云，重投影误差0.51-0.53像素，匹配密度影响BA时间。

Conclusion: 压缩域对应关系是实用且资源高效的前端方案，具有在完整流程中扩展的清晰路径。

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences
and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个高质量夜间图像去雨基准数据集HQ-NightRain和基于颜色空间转换的网络CST-Net，通过可学习的颜色空间转换器和隐式光照引导来提升夜间去雨效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像去雨面临复杂夜间场景和缺乏高质量数据集的挑战，现有数据集无法准确表示雨和光照的耦合效应。

Method: 开发CST-Net网络，包含可学习的颜色空间转换器(CSC)在Y通道进行去雨，并引入隐式光照引导来提升模型在复杂场景中的鲁棒性。

Result: 广泛的实验验证了所提出数据集的价值和方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的HQ-NightRain数据集和CST-Net方法能够有效解决夜间图像去雨问题，在复杂夜间场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

### [150] [Initialize to Generalize: A Stronger Initialization Pipeline for Sparse-View 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17479)
*Feng Zhou,Wenkai Guo,Pu Cao,Zhicheng Zhang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进稀疏视角3D高斯溅射初始化质量的方法，通过频率感知SfM、3DGS自初始化和点云正则化来增强点云覆盖和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视角下的3D高斯溅射容易过拟合训练视角，导致新视角渲染出现模糊等伪影。现有方法主要通过增强初始化或添加训练时约束来解决，但研究发现初始化是决定性因素。

Method: 1) 频率感知SfM：通过低频视角增强和宽松多视角对应改进低纹理区域覆盖；2) 3DGS自初始化：利用光度监督生成额外点，补充SfM稀疏区域；3) 点云正则化：通过几何/可见性先验确保多视角一致性和均匀空间覆盖。

Result: 在LLFF和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在稀疏视角设置下取得了持续的性能提升，证明了其作为更强初始化策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 初始化是稀疏视角3D高斯溅射的关键因素，提出的综合初始化方法显著提升了渲染质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at
https://github.com/zss171999645/ItG-GS.

Motivation: 现有占用世界模型依赖静态固定嵌入或网格，限制了感知灵活性，且其"原地分类"方法与真实场景的动态连续性存在潜在不匹配。

Method: 提出范围自适应感知模块（学习查询由自车状态调制并增强时空关联），状态条件预测模块（用回归引导公式替代基于分类的预测），以及时间感知自调度训练策略。

Conclusion: SparseWorld通过稀疏动态查询成功构建了灵活、自适应且高效的4D占用世界模型，为自动驾驶场景理解提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POTNet通过熵引导的双聚类头和最优传输技术生成高质量的伪掩码，AutoSOD基于此构建了无需像素级标签的端到端无监督显著目标检测系统，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测需要大量像素级标注，作者认为只要有可靠的伪掩码，无监督方法就能达到接近全监督的精度。现有原型方法存在边界和内部像素几何特性不同、最优传输全局一致性利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出POTNet，将单k-means步骤替换为熵引导双聚类头：高熵像素用谱聚类，低熵像素用k-means，两组原型通过最优传输对齐。这种分割-融合-传输设计能在单次前向传播中生成更清晰、部件感知的伪掩码。

Result: 在五个基准测试上，AutoSOD比无监督方法F-measure提升26%，比弱监督方法提升36%，进一步缩小了与全监督模型的差距。

Conclusion: 通过改进原型质量和最优传输利用，无监督显著目标检测可以达到接近全监督的精度，无需像素级标签和手工先验。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

*Yuanli Wu,Long Zhang,Yue Du,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于评分标准和伪标签的零样本视频摘要方法，通过将少量真实标注转化为伪标签来指导LLM进行可解释的场景评估，在保持零样本优势的同时显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法标注成本高且跨数据集泛化能力差，无监督方法难以捕捉高层次语义，而零样本方法对提示模板敏感。需要一种既无需训练又能稳定生成高质量摘要的方法。

Method: 使用少量真实标注生成高置信度伪标签，构建数据集自适应的评分标准。推理时基于场景描述和相邻场景的上下文摘要来评估叙事进展和冗余度，平衡局部显著性和全局连贯性。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上分别达到57.58和63.05的F1分数，超越了无监督和之前的零样本基线方法，接近监督方法的性能。

Conclusion: 评分标准引导的伪标签方法有效稳定了基于LLM的评分，为零样本视频摘要建立了一个通用且可解释的范式。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node
scaling, details are available in

Motivation: 解决主动监测中纵向分析面临的挑战：现有深度学习模型基于单时间点和专家标注数据训练，不适合多时间点且专家标注稀缺的纵向分析场景。

Method: 结合Mamba增强的交叉注意力模块和形状提取器模块，利用先前时间点的MRI和分割信息；采用半监督自训练策略，使用预训练nnU-Net生成的伪标签进行训练。

Conclusion: MambaX-Net为前列腺癌主动监测提供了一种有效的纵向分割解决方案，能够利用时间序列信息提升分割性能，减少对专家标注的依赖。

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

TL;DR: WP-CrackNet是一种端到端的弱监督道路裂缝检测方法，仅使用图像级标签进行像素级检测，通过分类器、重建器和检测器的对抗学习机制提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖，实现智能基础设施维护的可扩展道路裂缝检测。

Method: 集成三个组件：生成类激活图的分类器、测量特征可推断性的重建器、生成像素级检测结果的检测器；采用对抗学习机制；设计路径感知注意力模块和中心增强CAM一致性模块。

Result: 在三个图像级数据集上的实验表明，WP-CrackNet达到与监督方法相当的结果，优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著推进了可扩展道路检测，源代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

TL;DR: PAGE-4D是一个前馈模型，扩展了VGGT以处理动态场景，能够同时进行相机姿态估计、深度预测和点云重建，无需后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D前馈模型（如VGGT）在静态数据集上训练，难以处理包含复杂动态元素（如移动人物或可变形物体）的真实世界场景。

Method: 提出了动态感知聚合器，通过预测动态感知掩码来分离静态和动态信息——在姿态估计时抑制运动线索，在几何重建时增强运动线索。

Result: 在动态场景中，PAGE-4D始终优于原始VGGT，在相机姿态估计、单目和视频深度估计以及密集点图重建方面取得了更优结果。

Conclusion: PAGE-4D成功解决了多任务4D重建中的任务冲突问题，通过动态感知机制有效处理了动态场景的3D属性推断。

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeCraft是一个基于多智能体框架的文本到3D生成系统，通过图结构的程序化形状表示将复杂自然语言分解为子任务图，生成结构化、可交互的3D资产。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到3D生成方法产生非结构化网格和交互性差的问题，使其更适用于艺术工作流程。

Method: 提出基于图的程序化形状(GPS)表示，使用LLM智能体分层解析用户输入并迭代优化程序化建模和绘制过程。

Result: 定性和定量实验显示ShapeCraft在生成几何精确和语义丰富的3D资产方面优于现有基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: ShapeCraft展示了在动画和用户自定义编辑方面的多功能性，具有更广泛交互应用的潜力。

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的框架，利用无人机扫描点云和BIM合成数据的互补优势，实现3D点云自动分割，显著提高基础设施模型分割的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统依赖耗时且易出错的手动标注来分割3D模型中特定结构组件的问题，推进无人机和BIM技术在结构健康监测中的集成。

Method: 结合真实无人机扫描点云和BIM生成的合成数据，利用机器学习框架进行自动分割，通过小规模数据集和BIM数据补充减少训练时间。

Result: 在铁路轨道数据集上验证显示，能够高精度识别和分割轨道和轨枕等主要组件，同时保持合理的分割精度。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法提高了3D基础设施模型分割的精度和效率，推动了无人机和BIM技术在结构健康监测和基础设施管理中的集成应用。

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dinomaly2是一个统一的无监督异常检测框架，通过五个简单元素的协同作用，在标准重建框架中实现卓越性能，并在多种数据模态和任务设置中展现全谱系优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多类别异常检测模型性能显著落后于一对一模型，且领域碎片化严重，需要统一的解决方案来应对不同场景的部署需求。

Method: 采用"少即是多"理念，在标准重建框架中协调五个简单元素，无需修改即可自然扩展到多样化任务。

Result: 在12个基准测试中展现全谱系优势，多类别模型在MVTec-AD和VisA上分别达到99.9%和99.3%的I-AUROC，少样本设置下仅用8个正常样本即超越先前全样本模型。

Conclusion: 简约设计、计算可扩展性和通用适用性的结合使Dinomaly2成为现实世界异常检测应用的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaMiT数据集捕捉汽车模型的时间演化，支持监督和自监督学习。静态预训练在领域内数据上表现良好但跨年测试准确率下降。提出时间增量分类设置和两种策略来提升时间鲁棒性，并探索时间感知图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需要适应不断变化的视觉环境，特别是在物体外观随时间变化的领域。汽车模型作为技术制品的代表类别，其时间演化需要被研究。

Method: 引入CaMiT数据集，包含787K标注样本和5.1M未标注样本。提出时间增量分类设置，评估时间增量预训练和时间增量分类器学习两种策略，并探索时间感知图像生成。

Result: 静态预训练在领域内数据上表现竞争性但跨年测试准确率下降。时间增量策略改善了时间鲁棒性，时间感知图像生成产生了更真实的输出。

Conclusion: CaMiT为研究细粒度视觉识别和生成中的时间适应提供了丰富的基准，展示了时间增量学习策略在提升模型时间鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DINO-CV框架，使用高分辨率LiDAR DEM和自监督跨视图预训练策略，解决植被遮挡和标注数据稀缺问题，实现干石墙的自动分割映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干石墙具有重要遗产和环境价值，但许多因植被遮挡和人工测绘成本高而未被识别。深度学习分割虽可扩展，但面临视觉遮挡和标注数据有限两大挑战。

Method: 使用LiDAR DEM克服植被遮挡，提出基于知识蒸馏的自监督跨视图预训练策略，学习多DEM衍生物的视觉和几何不变表示，支持多种视觉骨干网络。

Result: 在Budj Bim UNESCO世界遗产地测试，mIoU达68.6%，仅用10%标注数据微调后仍保持63.8% mIoU，识别出澳大利亚最密集的殖民时期干石墙。

Conclusion: 高分辨率DEM衍生物的自监督学习在植被茂密、标注稀缺的遗产环境中，具有自动干石墙映射的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

TL;DR: 比较两种节俭联邦学习方法进行暴力检测：零样本和联邦微调的视觉语言模型(VLM)与个性化训练的紧凑3D卷积神经网络(CNN3D)。两种方法准确率均超90%，CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优于LoRA微调的VLM且能耗更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发资源高效的联邦学习方法用于暴力检测，特别关注能源效率和环境指标，为视频监控提供负责任、资源感知的AI基准。

Method: 使用LLaVA-7B和65.8M参数的CNN3D作为代表性案例，在现实非IID设置下评估准确性、校准和能耗。比较零样本/联邦微调VLMs与个性化训练CNN3D两种策略。

Result: 两种方法准确率均超过90%。CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优于LoRA微调的VLM，同时能耗更低。VLM在上下文推理和多模态推理方面仍具优势。

Conclusion: 支持混合模型：轻量级CNN用于常规分类，选择性激活VLM处理复杂或描述性场景。为视频监控提供可复现的负责任、资源感知AI基准框架。

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.
CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and
log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual
reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions
across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for
deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings
support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with
selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting
framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in
video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and
lifecycle-aware systems.

TL;DR: 提出了4DSegStreamer框架，采用双线程系统处理流式4D全景分割，可集成到现有3D/4D分割方法中实现实时能力，在高FPS条件下表现出优越的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高度动态环境中（如密集人群疏散、复杂场景自动驾驶）需要实时、细粒度的感知能力，现有方法在受限时间预算下难以满足需求。

Method: 采用双线程系统：预测线程利用历史运动和几何信息提取特征并预测未来动态；推理线程通过对齐最新内存并补偿自运动和动态物体移动来确保对传入帧的及时预测。

Result: 在室内HOI4D数据集和室外SemanticKITTI、nuScenes数据集上的综合实验证明了方法的有效性，特别是在复杂场景中准确预测动态物体方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 4DSegStreamer是一个通用框架，能够为现有3D和4D分割方法提供实时能力，在动态环境感知中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PICABench基准测试，用于系统评估图像编辑的物理真实性，涵盖光学、力学和状态转换等八个子维度，并发现当前主流模型在物理真实性方面仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型主要关注指令完成度，但忽视了伴随的物理效应（如阴影、反射、物体间相互作用），这些对生成真实性至关重要。

Method: 引入PICAEval评估协议，使用VLM作为评判器，结合逐案例、区域级的人工标注和问题；构建PICA-100K训练数据集，从视频中学习物理知识。

Result: 评估主流模型后发现，物理真实性仍是一个具有挑战性的问题，存在很大的探索空间。

Conclusion: 希望该基准测试和解决方案能为未来从简单内容编辑向物理一致的真实性转变奠定基础。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割基础模型微调方法存在两个问题：高层特征表示不足，以及微调过程破坏预训练权重的结构完整性。

Method: 1) 构建基础专家、语义专家和自适应专家，采用像素概率自适应投票策略进行专家选择和融合；2) 提出语义引导对比学习方法解决对比学习中弱监督问题。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，IC-MoE优于其他最先进模型，并验证了其在多样化医学图像分割场景中的优异泛化能力。

Conclusion: IC-MoE有效补充了基础医学图像分割模型的高层特征表示能力，同时保持了预训练权重的结构完整性。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

Result: 在所有多语言TIPR数据集上取得了新的最先进结果

Conclusion: Bi-IRRA框架有效解决了多语言文本到图像人物检索中的模态异质性问题，为多语言环境下的跨模态检索提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in
https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Motivation: 传统封闭式3D检测器难以泛化到开放世界场景，而直接使用3D开放词汇模型又面临词汇扩展和语义重叠问题，因此需要学习广义的3D物体性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Conclusion: 广义对抗求解器提供了一种简单有效的扩散模型加速采样方案，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only
available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal
deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new
post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference
across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to
models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on
DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帕金森病手绘图像检测方法存在两个主要局限：数据集不足和对未见患者数据缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段按绘图类型分类，第二阶段将图像分为2x2块分别提取特征，最后使用集成方法合并各块决策。

Result: 在NewHandPD数据集上，对已见患者准确率达97.08%，对未见患者达94.91%，性能差距仅2.17个百分点，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 分块策略和集成学习方法有效提升了帕金森病检测的泛化能力，特别在未见患者数据上表现优异。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in
prior work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于自动分析循环血细胞簇图像的计算框架，通过YOLOv11模型分类细胞簇，并利用多通道荧光染色识别细胞类型，准确率超过95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动分析包含细胞簇图像的工具，而细胞簇具有不规则形状、大小和异质性细胞类型，需要多通道染色来识别特定细胞类型。

Method: 采用两步分析策略：首先使用YOLOv11模型将图像分类为细胞簇和非细胞簇组，然后通过叠加簇轮廓与多通道荧光染色区域来识别细胞类型。

Result: 该方法在细胞簇分类和表型识别方面均达到超过95%的准确率，优于传统CNN和Vision Transformer模型。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架有效分析流式细胞术中的CCC图像，利用明场和荧光数据，具有扩展到分析免疫和肿瘤细胞簇等更广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaindropGS是一个用于评估3D高斯溅射在雨滴条件下的综合基准测试，揭示了现有方法在无约束雨滴图像上的性能限制和不同流水线组件的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射在真实雨滴条件下因镜头污染导致的严重遮挡和光学畸变问题，现有基准测试通常使用合成雨滴图像和已知相机位姿，无法应对真实场景中雨滴干扰相机位姿估计和点云初始化的问题。

Method: 构建包含三个对齐图像集（雨滴聚焦、背景聚焦和无雨地面真值）的真实世界雨滴重建数据集，设计完整的基准测试流水线，包括数据准备、数据处理和雨滴感知的3DGS评估。

Result: 通过全面实验分析，揭示了现有3DGS方法在无约束雨滴图像上的性能限制，以及相机焦点位置、不准确的位姿和点云初始化对重建的干扰影响。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发在雨滴条件下更鲁棒的3DGS方法指明了明确方向，强调了处理真实雨滴干扰的重要性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video
understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues.
Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that
focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated
multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously
aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and
multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we
extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available
to foster future research.

*Matheus Ramos Parracho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于原始签名图像和壳预处理两种方法在签名伪造检测中的跨数据集泛化性能，发现原始图像模型在基准测试中表现更好，而壳预处理方法显示出未来改进的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线签名验证中的深度学习方法在跨数据集泛化方面存在困难，手写风格和采集协议的差异会降低性能，因此需要研究改进特征学习策略以提高跨数据集鲁棒性。

Method: 使用CEDAR、ICDAR和GPDS Synthetic三个公共基准数据集，开发了两个实验流程：一个基于原始签名图像，另一个采用壳预处理方法，并分析比较了两种方法的行为模式。

Result: 原始图像模型在基准测试中取得了更高的性能，而基于壳预处理的方法显示出未来改进的潜力，但两种方法之间没有明确的优劣之分。

Conclusion: 虽然原始图像方法在当前表现更好，但壳预处理方法为开发鲁棒的跨域签名验证系统提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的描述符无关方法，通过矩阵分解将多个参考描述符联合建模为基表示，实现基于投影的残差匹配，在多参考视觉位置识别中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考视觉位置识别中，虽然使用不同条件下的参考集能提高定位性能，但增加数据多样性和模型复杂度会导致训练和部署时的计算成本过高的问题。

Method: 采用训练自由的描述符无关方法，通过矩阵分解将多个参考描述符联合建模为基表示，实现基于投影的残差匹配。

Result: 在多外观数据上，该方法比单参考方法Recall@1提升约18%，在外观和视角变化下均优于多参考基线方法，在非结构化数据上获得约5%的提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持轻量级的同时表现出强大的泛化能力，为多参考视觉位置识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双编码器和注意力机制的方法，结合病灶分割和临床元数据来提升皮肤病变分类的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌早期检测对患者预后至关重要，但现有深度学习模型存在"黑箱"问题，缺乏临床可信度，且面临类内差异大、类间差异小的挑战。

Method: 使用带双注意力门和空洞空间金字塔池化的Deep-UNet进行病灶分割，然后采用两个DenseNet201编码器分别处理原始图像和分割病灶，通过多头交叉注意力融合特征，并加入基于transformer的模块整合患者元数据。

Result: 在HAM10000、ISIC 2018和2019数据集上取得了最先进的分割性能，显著提升了分类准确率和平均AUC。Grad-CAM热图验证了模型基于病灶区域进行预测。

Conclusion: 整合精确的病灶分割、临床数据和基于注意力的特征融合，能够构建更准确和可解释的皮肤癌分类模型。

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseVILA是一种高效的视觉语言模型推理范式，通过在预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，在解码阶段仅检索查询相关token，实现速度提升而不损失能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的可扩展性受到视觉token数量增长的限制，这些token主导了推理延迟，需要更高效的推理方法。

Method: 提出解耦视觉稀疏性设计：预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，解码阶段检索查询相关token，基于AWQ优化的推理管道实现。

Result: 在长上下文视频任务上实现4.0倍预填充加速、2.5倍解码加速、2.6倍端到端加速，同时在文档理解和推理任务上提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过解耦查询无关剪枝和查询感知检索，SparseVILA为高效多模态推理提供了无需训练、架构无关的加速框架。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

TL;DR: 提出ConsistEdit方法，针对MM-DiT架构的注意力控制机制，解决了现有训练自由编辑方法在编辑强度与一致性保持之间的平衡问题，支持多轮和视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练自由注意力控制方法难以同时实现强编辑效果和源图像一致性，特别是在多轮和视频编辑中视觉错误会累积。大多数方法强制全局一致性，限制了细粒度编辑能力。

Method: 基于MM-DiT架构分析，提出ConsistEdit方法，包含仅视觉注意力控制、掩码引导预注意力融合、以及查询/键/值令牌的差异化操作。

Result: 在广泛的图像和视频编辑任务中实现最先进性能，支持结构一致和不一致场景，是首个无需手工操作即可在所有推理步骤和注意力层进行编辑的方法。

Conclusion: ConsistEdit显著提升了可靠性和一致性，支持鲁棒的多轮和多区域编辑，并能渐进调整结构一致性，实现更精细的控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

Motivation: 研究量子自然语言处理在自然语言推理任务中的应用，比较量子、混合和经典模型在少样本设置下的性能，特别关注参数效率。

Method: 使用lambeq库和DisCoCat框架构建参数化量子电路，训练句子对进行语义相关性和推理分类，引入信息增益每参数指标评估学习效率，并提出基于聚类的架构促进参数共享。

Result: 量子模型在性能上与经典基线相当，但参数数量显著减少；量子模型在推理任务中优于随机初始化的transformer，在相关性任务中测试误差更低；量子模型的学习效率比经典模型高出五个数量级。

Conclusion: 量子自然语言处理在低资源、结构敏感场景中具有巨大潜力，量子模型在参数效率方面显著优于经典模型，基于聚类的架构能改善泛化能力。

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum
circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of
Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical
transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq
library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits
for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference
classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel
information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which
quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate
that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while
operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models
outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower
test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly
higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more
than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource,
structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote
parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that
improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters
rather than individual tokens.

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance
the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the
full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234
radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only
prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of
62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a
95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the
impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes
following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly
selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal
cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while
consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions,
agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These
findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and
using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical
utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to
reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 虽然已有多种LLM自校正方法被提出，但缺乏对这些方法的全面评估，且LLM是否能真正自我校正仍是一个重要问题。

Method: 开发CorrectBench基准，评估内在、外部和微调三种自校正策略在常识推理、数学推理和代码生成三个任务上的表现。

Result: 1) 自校正方法能提高准确性，特别是在复杂推理任务中；2) 混合不同自校正策略能进一步改进，但降低效率；3) 推理LLM在额外自校正方法下优化有限且时间成本高；4) 简单的CoT基线表现出竞争性的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 自校正有潜力提升LLM推理性能，但需要进一步研究来优化推理能力与操作效率之间的平衡。

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical
component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various
self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these
methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly
correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this
study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the
effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and
fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction
methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing
different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it
reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited
optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.
Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline
demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the
potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while
highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently,
we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between
reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体在工具使用方面表现出色，但缺乏从自身经验中系统学习的能力。现有框架主要关注弥补外部知识差距，而未能解决更根本的限制：无法迭代优化问题解决策略。

Method: EvolveR框架包含两个关键阶段：(1)离线自蒸馏：将智能体的交互轨迹合成为结构化、可重用的抽象策略原则库；(2)在线交互：智能体与任务交互并主动检索蒸馏后的原则来指导决策，积累多样化的行为轨迹。采用策略强化机制迭代更新智能体。

Result: 在复杂多跳问答基准测试中，EvolveR实现了优于现有强基线智能体的性能表现。

Conclusion: 这项工作为智能体提供了一个全面的蓝图，使其不仅能够从外部数据中学习，还能从自身行为的后果中学习，为更自主和持续改进的系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool
use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own
experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external
knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the
inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we
introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through
a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key
stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction
trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable
strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with
tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making,
accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a
policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop
question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over
strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for
agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of
their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously
improving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/EvolveR.

### [186] [Evaluating Prompting Strategies and Large Language Models in Systematic Literature Review Screening: Relevance and Task-Stage Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16091)
*Binglan Han,Anuradha Mathrani,Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究量化了提示策略与大语言模型在自动化系统文献综述筛选阶段的交互作用，评估了6个LLM在5种提示类型下的表现，发现模型-提示交互效应显著，并提出了分阶段工作流程建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统文献综述的筛选阶段耗时且劳动密集，本研究旨在探索LLMs如何通过不同的提示策略来自动化这一过程，为研究者和从业者提供实用的部署指导。

Method: 评估了6个LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、DeepSeek-Chat-V3、Gemini-2.5-Flash、Claude-3.5-Haiku、Llama-4-Maverick）在5种提示类型（零样本、少样本、思维链、思维链少样本、自我反思）下的表现，使用准确性、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 结果显示显著的模型-提示交互效应：CoT少样本提供最可靠的精确率-召回率平衡；零样本在高敏感度筛选时召回率最高；自我反思因过度包容性和模型间不稳定性表现不佳。GPT-4o和DeepSeek整体表现稳健，GPT-4o-mini在显著降低成本下表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 建议采用分阶段工作流程：首先使用低成本模型配合结构化提示进行初步筛选，仅将边界案例升级到更高容量模型。研究结果突显了LLMs在自动化文献筛选方面不均衡但有前景的潜力，为任务自适应LLM部署提供了比较基准和实用指导。

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language
models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews
(SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection)
across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction
effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;
zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection
underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and
DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs
competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis
for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute
differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across
prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer
attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that
(1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening
and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These
findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature
screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a
comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

*Tina Behnia,Puneesh Deora,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个合成测试平台，用于系统分析语言模型中统计规律与事实关联之间的交互对泛化能力的影响，发现上下文多样性和结构对事实泛化的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对语言模型中统计规律与事实关联交互影响的系统分析，需要可控环境来研究这种交互如何影响泛化能力。

Method: 设计灵活的合成测试平台，将通用标记的统计流与源-目标标记对的事实流结合，通过独立控制上下文结构和多样性水平进行实验。

Result: 发现更高的上下文多样性会延迟分布内事实准确性，但对分布外事实泛化的影响取决于上下文结构；某些情况下多样性对事实回忆至关重要；识别了统计泛化独立失败的情况。

Conclusion: 上下文设计和多样性水平的相互作用影响不同泛化方面，通过模型组件干预发现分布外失败源于不同的优化瓶颈，特别是嵌入和解嵌入层的重要性。

Abstract: Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical
regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific
tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of
their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically
determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these
impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a
statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of
source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their
interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by
manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level
by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled
experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays
in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)
factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some
cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity
becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity
prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.
Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical
generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.
This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level
impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of
controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to
distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding
and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects
that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed
for future investigations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个关于生成式AI信任与不信任的计算研究，使用2022-2025年Reddit数据，发现信任与不信任基本平衡，技术性能和可用性是主要维度，个人经验是态度形成的最常见原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI系统融入日常生活，理解公众对其的信任对负责任采用和治理至关重要。现有研究缺乏计算性、大规模和纵向方法来衡量对GenAI和LLMs的信任与不信任。

Method: 使用多年度Reddit数据集（2022-2025年），涵盖39个子版块和197,618个帖子，结合众包标注和分类模型进行扩展分析。

Result: 信任与不信任随时间基本平衡，在主要模型发布时出现变化。技术性能和可用性占主导地位，个人经验是态度形成的最常见原因。不同信任者群体（专家、伦理学家、普通用户）呈现不同模式。

Conclusion: 研究为大规模信任分析提供了方法论框架，并洞察了公众对生成式AI不断演变的认知。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As
these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust
in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior
work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer
interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and
longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of
Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025)
spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a
representative sample were combined with classification models to scale
analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with
shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability
dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason
shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g.,
experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological
framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public
perceptions of GenAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和非洲地区的多模态文化多样性数据集仍然有限，需要专门针对埃及文化的资源来减少大型视觉语言模型中的文化偏见。

Method: 设计和运行新的数据收集流程，收集了涵盖地标、食物和民间传说等313个概念的3000多张图像，每个条目都经过人工验证文化真实性和多模态一致性。

Result: CLIP模型在EgMM-Corpus上的零样本性能为Top-1准确率21.2%，Top-5准确率36.4%，显示出明显的文化偏见。

Conclusion: EgMM-Corpus作为基准数据集对于开发具有文化意识的模型至关重要，现有大规模视觉语言模型存在显著的文化偏见问题。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are
still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this
paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian
culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected
over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore.
Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and
multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for
evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context.
We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and
36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing
cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the
importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析和实证验证，探讨了语言模型对语法的学习程度，提出了基于最小语义差异句子对的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否真正学习到了语法知识，以及如何通过字符串概率来揭示其语法结构知识，这对语言学理论有重要意义。

Method: 基于语料库生成过程的简单假设，构建理论分析框架，并在英语和中文的28万对句子对上验证三个预测。

Result: 验证了三个预测：(1)最小对字符串概率的相关性；(2)模型与人类在最小对中差异的相关性；(3)语法与不语法字符串在概率空间中的分离度差。

Conclusion: 为使用概率来研究语言模型的结构知识提供了理论基础，并为未来语言模型语法评估指明了方向。

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains
hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since
probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not
obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying
grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship
between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions
about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three
predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English
and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal
pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation
between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor
separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical
strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn
about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM
grammatical evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出两种低资源环境下增强语言模型多元对齐的方法：多元解码和模型引导，仅需50个标注样本就能在多个高风险任务中提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型训练范式假设每个查询只有一个最优答案，导致响应泛化且对齐效果差，需要确保模型能够反映人类价值观的多样性和细微差别

Method: 采用多元解码和模型引导两种方法，在低资源设置下（仅50个标注样本）增强语言模型的多元对齐能力

Result: 模型引导方法在零样本和少样本基线上表现一致提升，在仇恨言论检测和错误信息检测等高风险任务中降低假阳性率，在GlobalOpinionQA中改善与人类价值观的分布对齐

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了多样性的重要性，展示了语言模型如何适应考虑细微视角，为低资源环境下的多元对齐提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to
ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to
reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms
for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every
query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to
enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with
two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically
demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot
and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods
decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech
detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional
alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the
importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider
nuanced perspectives.

TL;DR: 提出了Profile-to-PEFT框架，使用超网络将用户配置文件直接映射到适配器参数，无需为每个用户单独训练，实现实时个性化LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法如"One-PEFT-Per-User"需要为每个用户训练单独的适配器，计算成本高且无法实时更新。

Method: 采用端到端训练的超网络，将编码后的用户配置文件直接映射到完整的适配器参数集（如LoRA），部署时无需每个用户单独训练。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于基于提示的个性化和OPPU方法，同时显著减少部署时的计算资源消耗，对分布外用户具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Profile-to-PEFT框架实现了高效、可扩展和自适应的LLM个性化，适用于大规模应用场景。

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) tailor content to individual
preferences using user profiles or histories. However, existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the
``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for
each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time
updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a
hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a
full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at
deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen
users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and
OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The
framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and
maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different
embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient,
scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale
applications.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了后训练大语言模型是否意识到自己的学习和思考过程，定义了三个核心能力：对学习策略的认知、策略跨领域泛化能力、以及内部推理与最终输出的对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着后训练技术让大语言模型能够通过生成规划令牌来处理复杂逻辑任务，需要探究这些模型是否真正意识到自己的学习和思考过程。

Method: 在多个需要学习不同策略的任务上进行实证评估，对比监督微调、直接策略优化和组相对策略优化三种后训练方法的模型表现。

Result: 强化学习训练的模型比监督微调模型表现出更强的学习行为认知能力和结构相似新任务的泛化能力，但其内部推理与最终输出的对齐度较弱，特别是在GRPO训练的模型中最为明显。

Conclusion: 后训练大语言模型确实具备一定程度的自我认知能力，但不同训练方法在策略认知、泛化能力和推理对齐方面存在显著差异，强化学习方法在认知和泛化方面表现更好但推理对齐较弱。

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language
Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive
tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development
raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and
"think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of
learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains,
and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We
empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require
learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models
post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization
(DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate
that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned
behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks
than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning
traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的疫苗错误信息严重影响了公共卫生，阻碍了高免疫接种率的实现并削弱了对健康建议的信任。虽然错误信息检测取得了进展，但实时生成针对性反驳论点仍是一个研究不足的领域。

Method: 基于先前错误信息反驳研究，实验了多种提示策略和微调方法优化反驳论点生成，并训练分类器将反疫苗推文分类为疫苗效力、副作用和政治影响等多标签类别，实现情境感知的反驳。

Result: 通过人工判断、LLM评估和自动指标的评估显示这些方法之间具有很强的一致性。研究发现整合标签描述和结构化微调能增强反驳论点的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模减轻疫苗错误信息提供了一个有前景的解决方案，表明整合标签描述和结构化微调能有效增强反驳论点的效果。

Abstract: In an era where public health is increasingly influenced by information
shared on social media, combatting vaccine skepticism and misinformation has
become a critical societal goal. Misleading narratives around vaccination have
spread widely, creating barriers to achieving high immunisation rates and
undermining trust in health recommendations. While efforts to detect
misinformation have made significant progress, the generation of real time
counter-arguments tailored to debunk such claims remains an insufficiently
explored area. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to generate
sound counter-argument rebuttals to vaccine misinformation. Building on prior
research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting
strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation.
Additionally, we train classifiers to categorise anti-vaccine tweets into
multi-labeled categories such as concerns about vaccine efficacy, side effects,
and political influences allowing for more context aware rebuttals. Our
evaluation, conducted through human judgment, LLM based assessments, and
automatic metrics, reveals strong alignment across these methods. Our findings
demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning
enhances counter-argument effectiveness, offering a promising approach for
mitigating vaccine misinformation at scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的论证挖掘方法通常通过生成式范式扁平化处理论证结构，难以有效建模论证组件和论证关系之间的复杂依赖关系。

Method: 使用自回归论证结构预测框架，将论证结构建模为预定义的约束动作集，通过条件预训练语言模型逐步构建论证结构。

Result: 在三个标准论证挖掘基准测试中，AASP在两个基准上实现了最先进的结果，在另一个基准上也取得了强劲表现。

Conclusion: AASP框架能够有效捕捉论证推理流程，为论证挖掘任务提供了一种高效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex
argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim
etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an
argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with
this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of
the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by
flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study
jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using
Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The
proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction
framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework
models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions
with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build
the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to
capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive
experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP
achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks
and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI,
opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental
Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that
smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in
domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet
powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without
relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method
consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations,
leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this
intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct
tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the
presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2)
completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression
based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results
highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally
efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

Motivation: 随着AI系统越来越多地参与决策，需要理解它们如何做出决策而不仅仅是决策结果。道德困境是评估AI程序推理的理想测试平台，因为允许多种合理结论。

Method: 创建MoReBench基准测试，包含道德场景和专家制定的评估标准，以及MoReBench-Theory用于测试AI在五种规范伦理框架下的推理能力。

Result: 研究发现缩放定律和现有数学、代码、科学推理基准无法预测模型的道德推理能力。模型对特定道德框架（如边沁功利主义和康德义务论）表现出偏好。

Conclusion: 这些基准测试推动了以过程为重点的推理评估，朝着更安全、更透明的AI发展。

Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and
for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is
imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how
they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both
final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces,
present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and
code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are
an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for
multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral
scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider
essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench
contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations,
weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI
advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously.
Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can
reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that
scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning
tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also
show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act
Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular
training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused
reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

Conclusion: ATA通过符号推理生成决策，为构建透明、可审计、可靠的自主体提供了实用可控的架构

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in
trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of
transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic
neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The
core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline
knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an
LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic
knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and
refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain
requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is
encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes
this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a
reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,
we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with
state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while
maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected
knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models,
while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input
perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating
decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and
controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent,
auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

*Fu-An Chao,Bi-Cheng Yan,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索了Whisper语音识别模型在第二语言口语评估中的潜力，通过提取其隐藏表示中的声学和语言特征，仅需训练轻量级分类器即可在GEPT数据集上超越现有先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挖掘Whisper模型在第二语言口语评估中的潜在能力，超越仅使用其转录文本的传统方法，探索其隐藏表示中蕴含的丰富信息。

Method: 从Whisper的中间和最终输出中提取声学和语言特征，仅训练轻量级分类器，并融入图像和文本提示作为辅助相关性线索。

Result: 在GEPT图片描述数据集上表现优异，超越了包括多模态方法在内的现有先进基线，通过融入额外信息获得了进一步性能提升。

Conclusion: 即使没有任务特定的微调，Whisper模型本质上编码了口语能力的序数模式和语义方面，显示出其作为口语评估和其他口语理解任务的强大基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a
well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the
context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that
extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a
step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and
linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight
classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs,
our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset,
outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach.
Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary
relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even
without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal
proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential
as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

*Syed Rifat Raiyan,Md Farhan Ishmam,Abdullah Al Imran,Mohammad Ali Moni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FrugalPrompt是一个新颖的LLM提示压缩框架，通过保留最具语义重要性的token来减少输入长度，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的长输入上下文导致高昂的货币成本、碳足迹和推理延迟，而典型提示中存在大量冗余的低效用token。

Method: 使用GlobEnc和DecompX两种token归因方法为输入序列中的每个token分配显著性分数，保留前k%的token并按原始顺序排列，获得稀疏的压缩提示。

Result: 在情感分析、常识问答和摘要任务中，20%的提示压缩仅导致性能轻微下降，而数学推理任务性能急剧恶化，表明对完整token连续性的更强依赖性。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于更细致地理解LLM在性能-效率权衡中的行为，并界定了对上下文稀疏性容忍的任务与需要完整上下文的任务之间的边界。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to
expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon
footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the
redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of
tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this
inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework
for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens.
Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,
we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to
preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse
frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment
Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a
suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction
incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that
contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In
contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,
reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis
with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns
that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may
resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional
NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding
of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the
boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring
exhaustive context. Our source code and models are available at:

TL;DR: TrajSelector是一个高效的Best-of-N框架，利用LLM的隐藏状态进行过程级评分，通过轻量级验证器评估推理轨迹质量，在保持较低推理成本的同时实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决外部TTS方法的高计算开销问题，充分利用LLM的内在潜在表示，避免对大规模步骤级标注的依赖。

Method: 使用仅0.6B参数的轻量级验证器评估逐步推理轨迹质量，通过端到端训练方法聚合分数选择最优推理路径。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，TrajSelector在Best-of-32设置下比多数投票准确率高4.61%，比现有过程奖励模型高4.31%到12.21%，且推理成本更低。

Conclusion: TrajSelector通过利用LLM隐藏状态进行过程级评分，实现了高效且有效的Best-of-N选择，在保持低推理成本的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that
allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS
(particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance
improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning
trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high
computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the
underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce
TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the
hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight
verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise
trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning
trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training
recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential
results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers
consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority
voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by
4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

Motivation: 现有广告视频违规检测方法在时间定位精度、噪声标注处理和泛化能力方面存在不足，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 采用课程强化学习与多模态大语言模型结合，使用渐进式训练策略和GRPO算法，构建多层次奖励机制来提升时间定位和类别预测精度。

Result: 在工业数据集和公共基准测试中，RAVEN在违规类别准确性和时间间隔定位方面表现优异，在线A/B测试验证了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: RAVEN框架有效解决了广告视频违规检测中的关键挑战，具有强大的泛化能力，并能缓解监督微调带来的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring
platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal
grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a
novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive
capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training
strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities
without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated
reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category
prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that
RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and
temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN
on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its
practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall.
RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic
forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了自然语言推理(NLI)中标签变异的研究范围，不仅关注标注者在推理类型上的分歧，还考察了他们在标注步骤中的差异。研究发现表面标签分歧可能掩盖了深层的解释一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注标注者标签一致但解释不同的情况，本文旨在更全面地分析NLI标注中的个体差异，包括标注步骤和推理类型两个维度的分歧。

Method: 应用LiTEx分类法分析两个英文NLI数据集，从多个维度对齐标注变异：NLI标签一致性、解释相似性和分类法一致性，并考虑标注者选择偏见的复合因素。

Result: 发现标注者可能在标签上存在分歧，但提供高度相似的解释；揭示了标注者在解释策略和标签选择上的个体偏好；推理类型一致性比标签一致性更能反映自由文本解释的语义相似性。

Conclusion: 基于推理的解释具有丰富性，需要谨慎对待标签作为绝对真值；推理类型一致性比标签一致性更能准确反映标注者的理解一致性。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To
better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the
underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the
LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into
reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on
within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but
provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by
examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in
the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning
process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We
apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from
multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy
agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias.
We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly
similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask
underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals
individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These
findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the
semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our
findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need
for caution in treating labels as ground truth.

TL;DR: 提出在LLM代理中引入"退出"机制作为安全防护，让代理在缺乏信心时主动退出，通过ToolEmu框架评估12个先进LLM，结果显示安全性和有用性达到良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在复杂环境中运行并产生现实后果，其安全性变得至关重要。多轮代理场景中的不确定性和模糊性会累积，导致超出传统文本生成失败的严重风险。

Method: 使用ToolEmu框架对12个最先进的LLM进行系统性评估，通过在代理提示中添加明确的退出指令，让代理在缺乏信心时主动退出。

Result: 代理在添加退出指令后，安全性平均提高0.39（0-3分制），专有模型提高0.64，而有用性仅平均下降0.03，显示出极佳的安全-有用性权衡。

Conclusion: 简单的退出指令是一种高度有效的安全机制，可立即部署到现有代理系统中，作为高风险应用中自主代理的第一道防线。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly operate in complex
environments with real-world consequences, their safety becomes critical. While
uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn
agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where
uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks
beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using "quitting" as a
simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and
withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu
framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable
safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit
instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all
models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average
decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding
explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism
that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes
quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in
high-stakes applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体系统组合方法依赖静态语义检索，存在能力描述不完整、选择不考虑能力/成本/实时效用等问题，难以实现有效组件重用和组合。

Method: 引入结构化自动化框架，灵感来自背包问题，让组合器智能体系统性地识别、选择和组装最优智能体组件集，综合考虑性能、预算约束和兼容性。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上的实验表明，在线背包组合器始终位于帕累托前沿，相比基线方法成功率显著提升（单智能体提升31.6%，多智能体从37%提升至87%），组件成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法在多样化领域和预算约束下展现出强大的适应性，证实了基于在线背包问题的智能体系统组合方法的有效性。

Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and
integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain
environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval
approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and
composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete
capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component
selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and
real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,
automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the
knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically
identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly
considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically
testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our
approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable
reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five
benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer
consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at
significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the
single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate
improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In
multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from
37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The
substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method
across diverse domains and budget constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同行评审作为科学守门人面临提交量激增和LLM广泛使用的挑战，有缺陷的评审（来自人类专家和AI系统）威胁同行评审生态系统和学术诚信。

Method: 四阶段LLM驱动框架：收集ICLR和NeurIPS论文及评审；使用GPT-4.1标注评审类型；通过LLM驱动的合成数据增强解决类别不平衡和数据稀缺问题；微调编码器模型和开源LLMs。

Result: 构建了包含6,634篇论文、24,657个真实评审和46,438个合成评审的语料库。有缺陷评审显示较低评分、较高自信度、减少的结构复杂性和更多负面情绪。ChatGPT出现后AI生成评审显著增加。混合训练显著提高了二元任务的召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 这是首个用于检测有缺陷同行评审的LLM驱动系统，为同行评审中的AI治理提供证据，并为维护学术诚信的人机协作提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions
and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation
present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to
improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However,
unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to
systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic
integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an
automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard
employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR
and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2)
annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class
imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation,
producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438
synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source
LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of
the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate
lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural
complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text
detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have
increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models,
mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial
enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents
the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing
evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable
insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析大语言模型在回答文化相关问题时内部激活路径的重叠程度，揭示模型内部文化理解机制，发现语言特异性比文化特异性对内部表征的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在不同文化背景下的应用增多，准确的文化理解变得至关重要。现有评估多关注输出层面，难以揭示响应差异的驱动因素，而电路分析研究覆盖语言少且很少关注文化。

Method: 通过测量回答语义相同问题时激活路径的重叠程度，在两种条件下进行：固定问题语言改变目标国家，以及固定国家改变问题语言。同时使用同语言国家对比来区分语言和文化因素。

Result: 结果显示，同语言跨国家问题的内部路径重叠度高于跨语言同国家问题，表明存在强烈的语言特定模式。特别地，韩国-朝鲜对比显示出低重叠度和高变异性，说明语言相似性不能保证内部表征的一致性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的内部文化理解机制受到语言特异性的强烈影响，语言相似性并不一定带来文化表征的一致性，这对跨文化应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural
contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations
have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that
drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have
covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace
LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path
overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions:
varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the
question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country
pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal
paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for
cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific
patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and
high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned
internal representation.

TL;DR: SHALLOW是首个系统分类和量化ASR系统中幻觉现象的基准框架，通过词汇、音素、形态和语义四个维度评估模型，在WER较高时能捕捉WER无法区分的细粒度错误模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统中的幻觉会产生与语音信号完全无关但语法语义合理的转录，在医疗和法律等关键领域带来严重风险。传统评估指标无法区分语音不准确和幻觉，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 引入SHALLOW框架，系统地将ASR幻觉现象分为四个互补维度：词汇、音素、形态和语义，为每个类别定义针对性指标以生成可解释的模型行为分析。

Result: 在不同架构和语音领域的评估显示，SHALLOW指标在识别质量高时与WER强相关，但随着WER增加相关性显著减弱，SHALLOW能捕捉WER在退化条件下无法区分的细粒度错误模式。

Conclusion: SHALLOW框架支持对模型弱点的具体诊断，并提供超越聚合错误率的模型改进反馈，是评估ASR系统幻觉倾向的有效工具。

Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent
and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely
unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While
similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the
usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be
more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically
plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing
stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as
healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on
error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and
hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation
frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened
propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce
SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and
quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes:
lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics
within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.
Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have
found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when
recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens
substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error
patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging
conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and
provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can
offer.

Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本能力的增强，区分人类写作和AI生成文本变得越来越困难，特别是在乌尔都语等低资源语言中缺乏检测工具。

Method: 构建包含1800篇人类写作和1800篇AI生成文本的平衡数据集，进行语言和统计分析，微调三种多语言transformer模型（mdeberta-v3-base、distilbert-base-multilingualcased、xlm-roberta-base）。

Result: mDeBERTa-v3-base模型表现最佳，在测试集上获得91.29%的F1分数和91.26%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了乌尔都语社区打击错误信息和学术不端的努力，并为低资源语言的NLP工具开发做出了贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely
resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but
this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text
was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more
serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to
detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated
text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset
comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from
models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed
linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as
character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram
patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests.
Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as
mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were
fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest
performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set.
This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic
misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader
development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

TL;DR: DiMo框架通过模拟四个专门LLM代理的结构化辩论，提升大语言模型的性能和可解释性，在六个基准测试中表现优于单模型和辩论基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能强大但缺乏可解释的推理过程，需要一种能同时提升性能和解释性的方法。

Method: 使用四个体现不同推理范式的专门LLM代理进行迭代辩论，通过相互挑战和精炼初始响应来探索多样认知方法。

Result: 在统一开源设置下，DiMo在六个基准测试中准确率超过广泛使用的单模型和辩论基线，在数学任务上提升最大。

Conclusion: DiMo是一个语义感知、Web原生的多代理框架，能够产生语义类型化、URL注释的证据链，为下游系统提供可检查和重用的结构化证明。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack
interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration
Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance
and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized
LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the
framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through
iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more
robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six
benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over
widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math.
We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it
models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically
typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly
interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the
framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs,
combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that
downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

TL;DR: 提出Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT)方法，通过结合实例感知和任务感知信息，使用单个胶囊提示实现参数高效的微调，解决了传统提示学习方法对提示长度和数量的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示学习方法依赖网格搜索确定最佳提示长度，需要大量提示，计算负担重，且缺乏实例感知信息，导致与输入序列的注意力交互受限。

Method: CaPT方法创新性地将实例感知和任务感知信息以几乎参数免费的方式集成到单个胶囊提示中，利用现成的实例语义信息增强提示学习效果。

Result: 在T5-Large上达到84.03%的平均准确率，在Llama3.2-1B上仅使用模型参数的0.003%，实现了优越性能和高效参数利用。

Conclusion: CaPT方法通过引入'注意力锚'机制，有效提升了提示学习的效果和效率，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)
approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream
tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its
successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid
searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number
of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer
findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by
its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention
interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating
instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the
prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we
find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating
instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully
preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more
active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our
observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and
effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics
into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both
instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner
(i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our
method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g.,
84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while
enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on
Llama3.2-1B).

### [213] [Temporal Understanding under Deictic Frame of Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685)
*Damin Zhang,Julia Rayz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了TUuD框架，评估大语言模型在时间参考框架动态变化时对时间-事件和事件-事件关系的理解能力。研究发现LLMs在时间认知上表现出部分类人特征，但对参考框架变化和时间距离敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过空间隐喻来概念化时间体验，但大语言模型在时间理解和推理方面仍有局限。本文旨在评估LLMs如何解释时间关系，特别是当"现在"这一参考点在时间线上动态移动时。

Method: 引入TUuD框架，让LLMs从0.00到1.00评分当前时刻与目标事件的相似度，量化两者之间的时间对齐感知。评估了四种LLMs在动态时间参考框架下的表现。

Result: 四种评估的LLMs都表现出对时间参考框架的可测量适应，相似度评分在现在附近达到峰值，并向过去和未来事件递减。但这种适应在超出近期语境时会减弱。

Conclusion: LLMs显示出部分类人的时间认知能力，但它们的时序推理仍然对参考框架变化和时间距离敏感，表明其时间理解能力仍有局限。

Abstract: Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal
experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in
sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We
are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of
reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.
Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines
how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of
"now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in
natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about
time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding
under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event
and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts
along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition
\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the
current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00
(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment
between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit
measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking
around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The
adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while
LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning
remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了思维链（CoT）推理在自然语言理解（NLU）任务中的应用，发现随着模型规模增大，CoT推理从阻碍NLU性能转变为超越直接标签预测，且特定设计的训练方法能带来性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注思维链在推理任务中的作用，而忽视了其在自然语言理解任务中的潜在影响。本研究旨在系统探索思维链是否同样能有益于NLU任务。

Method: 构建了NLURC数据集（包含思维链的全面高质量NLU数据集集合），并开发了多种思维链增强方法，在NLU任务上测试这些方法的适用性。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：1）CoT推理与模型规模呈正相关；2）大多数思维链增强训练方法表现不如仅标签训练，但一种特殊设计的方法能持续改进；3）用思维链训练的LLM在未见过的NLU任务上表现显著提升，性能可与十倍规模模型媲美，同时提供与商业LLM相当的可解释性。

Conclusion: 思维链方法在NLU任务中具有重要价值，特别是在模型规模较大时能显著提升性能，并为模型提供更好的可解释性，在迁移学习场景下表现尤为突出。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, which provide step-by-step reasoning to
derive final answers, benefit LLMs in both inference and training.
Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during
inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during
training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic
and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of
rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on
other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this
work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To
conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and
high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various
rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these
methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially
surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to
surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive
correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than
label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving
improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance
gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while
delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.

Conclusion: 这篇综述提供了迄今为止心脏病学领域NLP研究最全面的概述，展示了NLP技术在心血管疾病研究中的重要应用价值和广阔前景。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society
and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related
conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a
combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various
socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially
complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data,
which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature,
among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly
been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount
of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain
deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to
revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in
cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find
articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range
of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process,
we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from
multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types,
cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals
considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the
considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a
temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP
methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the
review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in
cardiology to date.

*Shivam Ratnakar,Sanjay Raghavendra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了LLM中的"变色龙行为"，即LLM在多轮对话中面对矛盾问题时改变立场的倾向，揭示了搜索增强LLM的严重可靠性漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成LLM与搜索/检索引擎的系统已无处不在，但这些系统存在关键漏洞，会削弱其可靠性。需要系统评估LLM在多轮对话中立场一致性的问题。

Method: 构建了包含17,770个问答对的Chameleon基准数据集，涵盖1,180个多轮对话和12个争议领域。提出了两个理论指标：量化立场不稳定性的变色龙分数和衡量知识多样性的源重用率。

Result: 对Llama-4-Maverick、GPT-4o-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash的评估显示所有模型都表现出严重的变色龙行为（分数0.391-0.511），GPT-4o-mini表现最差。源重用率与置信度（r=0.627）和立场变化（r=0.429）存在显著相关性。

Conclusion: 有限的知识多样性使模型病态地顺从查询框架，这些发现强调在医疗、法律和金融等需要跨交互保持连贯立场的系统中部署LLM前，需要进行全面的致性评估。

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become
ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines
their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon
behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with
contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in
search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising
17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn
conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in
state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the
Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use
Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of
Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent
failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511),
with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small
across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a
sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations
between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes
(r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that
limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query
framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency
evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems
where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for
reliable decision support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了诗歌中空格的使用模式，比较了人类创作诗歌与LLM生成诗歌在空格使用上的差异，并探讨了文本处理方法对诗歌空格表示的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 诗歌中的空格是诗体形式的重要组成部分，反映了诗人的艺术选择，但在NLP研究中未得到足够重视。研究者希望填补这一空白，研究空格在诗歌中的语义和空间特征。

Method: 使用来自Poetry Foundation的19k首英语诗歌语料库，分析4k位诗人的空格使用模式，并比较LLM生成的51k首诗歌和在线社区发布的12k首未发表诗歌的空格使用。

Result: 研究发现不同文本处理方法会导致诗歌数据中空格表示的显著差异，发布了2.8k首公共领域诗歌用于进一步研究。

Conclusion: 诗歌中的空格使用模式对LLM预训练数据集的构建策略具有重要启示，需要更细致地处理诗歌格式以保留其艺术特征。

Abstract: Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence
to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace
distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral
semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry
as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language
models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP
community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry
Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We
release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to
facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the
published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems
posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time
periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different
text processing methods can result in significantly different representations
of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace
patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble
pretraining datasets for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Beacon是一个单轮强制选择基准，用于测量语言模型在事实准确性和顺从偏见之间的权衡，揭示了模型容量越大越容易产生奉承偏见的趋势，并提出了干预方法来调节这些偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在奖励优化过程中混淆了帮助性和礼貌服从，形成了在真实性和奉承之间的结构性权衡，这种潜在的奉承偏见表现为优先用户同意而非原则性推理。

Method: 引入Beacon基准，通过单轮强制选择隔离奉承偏见，独立于对话上下文；评估12个最先进模型；提出提示级和激活级干预方法来调节偏见。

Result: 评估显示奉承偏见可分解为稳定的语言和情感子偏见，每个都随模型容量扩展；干预方法能在相反方向上调节这些偏见，揭示了真实性和社会合规判断之间的动态对齐几何。

Conclusion: Beacon将奉承重新定义为可测量的规范性错误泛化形式，为研究和大规模生成系统中的对齐漂移缓解提供了可重复的基础。

Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness
and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates
helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy,
manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We
introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias
independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the
tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve
state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable
linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We
further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate
these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of
alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant
judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative
misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and
mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言智能体在动态对抗游戏中策略推理能力不足，需要不依赖专家标注数据的自动学习方法，而对手选择对学习性能有重要影响但研究较少。

Method: 提出SCO-PAL方法，通过不同级别对手设置分析对手选择策略，发现自博弈是最有效的学习方式。

Result: 使用SCO-PAL结合自博弈，相比基线方法平均胜率提升约30%，在六种对抗游戏中对抗GPT-4达到54.76%胜率。

Conclusion: 自博弈是提升对抗环境中策略推理能力的最有效方式，SCO-PAL方法显著提升了语言智能体的游戏表现。

Abstract: Existing language agents often encounter difficulties in dynamic adversarial
games due to poor strategic reasoning. To mitigate this limitation, a promising
approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically,
without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where
agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in
dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance.
However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an
area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy
Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we
conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at
different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve
strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with
self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by
approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against
GPT-4 in six adversarial games.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend
extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation
methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding.
In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation
benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and
Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval
introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering,
bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and
multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to
assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information
tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark
includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a
comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres.
Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results
indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing
models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the
complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

Conclusion: 平衡的联合监督和分阶段适应策略对有效领域适应至关重要，综合消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain
Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of
sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked
supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale
general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly
optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a
unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of
domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic
discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our
approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements
up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong
general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate
the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced
joint supervision and staged adaptation.

TL;DR: LLMs在实体比较任务中经常依赖启发式偏见而非真实知识，即使拥有准确的数值知识。研究发现实体流行度、提及顺序和语义共现三种启发式偏见严重影响预测。大模型能选择性地依赖更可靠的数值知识，而小模型则缺乏这种辨别能力。思维链提示能引导所有模型使用数值特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在知识推理任务中何时依赖真实知识而非表面启发式，通过实体比较任务来系统分析模型的行为模式。

Method: 使用实体比较任务（如比较河流长度），分析LLMs的预测行为，识别三种启发式偏见：实体流行度、提及顺序和语义共现。比较不同规模模型的表现，并测试思维链提示的效果。

Result: LLMs经常做出与自身数值知识相矛盾的预测。小模型（7-8B参数）的预测更多受启发式偏见影响，而大模型（32B参数）能选择性地依赖更可靠的数值知识。思维链提示能有效引导所有模型使用数值特征进行推理。

Conclusion: 模型规模影响LLMs在知识推理中的表现，大模型能更好地在启发式和原则性推理之间进行权衡。思维链提示是改善模型推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based
reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus
superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question
through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along
numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the
Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite
having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make
predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases
that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,
and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression
using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the
model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override
principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)
selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller
models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why
larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more
accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using
the numerical features across all model sizes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨体裁作者归属任务中避免依赖主题线索，而是学习独立于文本主题的作者特定语言模式的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段检索-重排框架，针对重排器设计了专门的数据筛选策略，避免使用信息检索中常见的训练策略。

Result: 在HIATUS的HRS1和HRS2跨体裁作者归属基准上，分别比之前最佳方法提升了22.3和34.4个绝对Success@8点。

Conclusion: 所提出的LLM检索-重排管道在跨体裁作者归属任务中取得了显著性能提升，证明了专门训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author
of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a
two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA.
Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a
de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues
and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are
independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently,
for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR
are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal
behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that
enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using

TL;DR: CoRUS框架通过角色理论模拟基于用户角色的提问，发现在阿片类药物使用障碍等敏感领域，不同提问者角色会系统性地影响语言模型的回应方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估大多忽略提问者角色，但在敏感领域如阿片类药物使用障碍中，考虑用户背景对提供无污名化回应至关重要。

Method: 基于角色理论和在线康复社区数据构建提问者角色分类（患者、照顾者、从业者），模拟15,321个嵌入角色目标、行为和经验的问题。

Result: 模拟问题高度可信且与现实数据相当。脆弱角色（患者、照顾者）比从业者获得更多支持性回应（+17%）但知识内容减少（-19%）。

Conclusion: 用户角色的隐式信号会系统性地影响模型回应，为对话AI的角色知情评估提供了方法论。

Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their
questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed --
creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations,
while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking.
This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use
disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide
accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for
User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based
questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery
community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles --
patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321
questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our
evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable
to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but
differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as
patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced
knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates
how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a
methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

TL;DR: FinSight是一个多智能体框架，通过CAVM架构、迭代视觉增强机制和两阶段写作框架，自动生成高质量的多模态财务报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成专业财务报告是劳动密集型且智力要求高的过程，现有AI系统难以完全自动化。

Method: 采用CAVM架构统一外部数据、工具和智能体；提出迭代视觉增强机制优化图表；使用两阶段写作框架扩展分析内容。

Result: 在各种公司和行业级任务中，FinSight在事实准确性、分析深度和呈现质量方面显著优于所有基线系统。

Conclusion: FinSight展示了生成接近人类专家质量报告的有效路径。

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and
intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully
automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight),
a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial
reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory
(CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents
into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis
and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade
visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that
progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts.
Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis
segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both
analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and
industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all
baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual
accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear
path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

TL;DR: 提出神经群体通信（NGC）框架，将神经网络重新构想为神经群体交互的动态系统，通过低维信号交换减少冗余参数，在语言模型中实现高效推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代神经网络规模扩大带来的效率和可解释性挑战，构建学习高效、模块化和可解释表示的大型神经系统的核心问题。

Method: 将神经网络视为神经群体交互的动态系统，权重作为神经状态间的瞬时交互，通过群体间迭代通信进行神经计算，引入神经稳定性度量分析推理能力。

Result: 在大型语言模型中实例化NGC，在适度压缩下在复杂推理基准上表现更优，在相同压缩率下优于标准低秩近似和跨层基共享方法。

Conclusion: NGC框架通过结构化神经群体动态与高维学习系统中的泛化能力相关，为构建高效、模块化和可解释的神经网络提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented
performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability.
This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems
that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose
Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a
neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than
a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as
an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient
interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation
unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This
low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons
exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and
inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant
parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal
stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the
contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence
processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities
correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the
neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.
Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate
improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate
compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and
cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude
by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured
neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional
learning systems.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了基于心理学感知理论的多模态知识理解基准，发现视觉语言模型在体现知识理解方面并不优于纯文本模型，且在视觉维度表现最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态语言模型取得显著进展，但尚不清楚视觉基础是否比纯文本模型更好地增强其对体现知识的理解。

Method: 构建基于心理学感知理论的体现知识理解基准，包含视觉、听觉、触觉、味觉、嗅觉等外部感觉和内部感知，通过向量比较和问答任务评估模型感知能力。

Result: 比较30个最先进的语言模型后发现，视觉语言模型在两项任务中均未优于纯文本模型，且在视觉维度表现显著差于其他感官维度。向量表示易受词形和频率影响，模型在空间感知和推理问题上表现困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要更有效地将体现知识整合到语言模型中，以增强其对物理世界的理解。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains
unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied
knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a
novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory
from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory
external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models'
perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector
comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing
30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models
(VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models
perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory
dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily
influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer
questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore
the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance
their understanding of the physical world.

TL;DR: ChiKhaPo是一个大规模多语言基准测试，包含8个子任务，覆盖2700+语言，用于评估生成模型在词汇理解和生成方面的基本语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型基准测试主要针对高资源或中资源语言，且多关注推理和生成等高阶任务，而实际上LLMs在大多数世界语言中缺乏基本的语言能力。

Method: 利用现有词典、单语数据和双语平行语料构建ChiKhaPo基准，包含8个不同难度的子任务来评估词汇理解和生成能力。

Result: 6个最先进的模型在该基准测试中表现不佳，性能得分受语言家族、语言资源丰富度、任务类型以及理解与生成方向等因素影响。

Conclusion: ChiKhaPo旨在推动和鼓励对LLMs进行大规模多语言基准测试，填补现有基准在语言覆盖范围上的不足。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted
to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on
higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence
points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast
majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo,
consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical
comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on
existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for
2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of
language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our
benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores,
including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension
versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage
the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PROMPT-MII是一种基于强化学习的元学习框架，能够为任意新数据集生成紧凑的指令提示，在保持与上下文学习相当性能的同时，显著减少推理所需的token数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习虽然有效，但随着上下文长度增长会产生高昂的推理成本，需要找到既能保持性能又更高效的替代方法。

Method: 提出PROMPT-MII框架，使用强化学习元学习指令归纳模型，将训练示例压缩为紧凑但具描述性的提示，在3000多个多样化分类数据集上进行训练。

Result: 在90个未见任务上评估，PROMPT-MII将下游模型质量提高了4-9个F1点（相对提升10-20%），匹配上下文学习性能同时所需token减少3-13倍。

Conclusion: PROMPT-MII能够有效替代上下文学习，在保持性能的同时大幅降低推理成本，为大型语言模型的高效适应提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is
in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs
as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform
instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a
compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL
over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction
induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an
arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets
from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves
downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL
performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次将参数高效微调(PEFT)应用于孟加拉语仇恨言论检测，使用LoRA和QLoRA技术在三个大型语言模型上进行微调，在BD-SHS数据集上取得了最高92.23%的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语社交媒体上仇恨言论激增，特别是针对妇女和青少年。现有方法要么依赖计算成本高的全模型微调，要么使用专有API，缺乏高效实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用LoRA和QLoRA参数高效微调技术，在Gemma-3-4B、Llama-3.2-3B和Mistral-7B三个指令调优大语言模型上微调，仅训练少于1%的参数，在单张消费级GPU上完成实验。

Result: Llama-3.2-3B获得最高F1分数92.23%，Mistral-7B为88.94%，Gemma-3-4B为80.25%。所有模型在50,281条标注评论的BD-SHS数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: PEFT被证明是孟加拉语及相关低资源语言仇恨言论检测的实用且可复现策略，为低资源语言NLP任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate
speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such
as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely
on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs.
This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three
instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and
Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated
comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters,
enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that
Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at
88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical
and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UTF8Tokenizer是一个极简的字节级分词器，直接将文本映射到UTF-8编码对应的字节ID，使用C0控制字节编码特殊行为，提供更快的分词速度、更小的传输开销和可共享的嵌入表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字节级分词方法存在超出范围的ID或引入辅助标记的问题，需要一个更简洁高效的分词方案。

Method: 使用UTF-8编码的字节作为token ID，所有特殊行为通过C0控制字节编码，采用256维嵌入表和位偏置嵌入技术。

Result: 分词速度提升14倍，主机-设备传输减少8倍，语言建模收敛性得到改善。

Conclusion: UTF8Tokenizer提供了一种高效、简洁的分词方案，具有实际应用优势。

Abstract: We present UTF8Tokenizer, a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text
exactly to IDs corresponding to the bytes underlying the text's UTF-8 encoding
(e.g., byte x09 is token ID 9). Unlike prior byte-level approaches (Xue et al.,
2021; Pagnoni et al., 2025), our implementation never introduces out-of-range
IDs (i.e. there is no token ID 256) or auxiliary tokens: all special behavior
(e.g., padding, boundaries, conversation structure, attention segments, tool
calling, "thinking" spans, etc.) is encoded using C0 control bytes - just as
ASCII was originally designed to embed control information alongside printable
text. These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization
(14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2)
simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and
(3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes
per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training,
removing inference costs. Our HuggingFace-compatible implementation improves
language modeling convergence.

*Yuval Reif,Guy Kaplan,Roy Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种词汇表压缩方法，通过将词形变化表示为基本词向量与变换向量的组合，从而减少词汇表大小并提高多语言覆盖，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词算法将词形变化视为独立标记，导致词汇表被表面形式变体填满，牺牲了低频词和多语言覆盖。

Method: 使用变换向量捕获词形变化，将词汇表重新设计为共享基本词向量和变换向量的组合形式，而不修改模型权重。

Result: 在多个LLM和五种语言上，最多可移除10%的词汇表条目，扩展了词汇覆盖范围，对下游任务性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 研究推动了词汇表设计的根本性重新思考，从字符串枚举转向利用语言底层结构的组合式词汇表。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such
as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard
tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling
the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking",
"Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We
show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors --
additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied
to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces.
Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than
assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base
form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We
apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to
10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more
diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage
to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and
without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational
rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a
compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的动态防御框架，通过在线学习对抗迭代越狱攻击，同时使用Past-Direction Gradient Damping防止过拟合，显著提升了LLM的安全性和无害任务的响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法无法主动破坏迭代越狱攻击的动态试错循环，这种攻击通过反复重写提示词来诱导有害输出，利用模型之前的响应指导每次迭代，是一种高效的攻击策略。

Method: 采用基于强化学习的方法动态更新防御策略，通过在线学习响应每个新的越狱提示；引入Past-Direction Gradient Damping来抑制对攻击期间探索的有限输入重写过拟合；利用有害越狱提示与典型无害提示之间的差异来优化提示。

Result: 在三个LLM上的实验表明，该方法显著优于五种现有防御方法对抗五种迭代越狱方法；同时，提示优化策略还提高了无害任务的响应质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的动态防御框架能有效对抗迭代越狱攻击，在保持安全性的同时提升模型对无害任务的响应性能，为LLM安全防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into
large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's
previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a
highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy
against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively
disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel
framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning
in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the
distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless
prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes
prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly
rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band
of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce
Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs
show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods
against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that
our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for
harmless tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注自然语言理解中的显式信息提取，缺乏针对隐式信息和语用推理的更具挑战性的多语言基准。

Method: 构建了包含12种语言、四个语篇理解层次的基准测试，评估模型在跨句子、段落和多个说话者话语中整合和聚合信息的能力。

Result: 评估显示这些任务即使对于最先进的模型也具有挑战性。

Conclusion: DiscoTrack基准填补了现有基准的空白，为评估LLM在语篇跟踪方面的能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are
still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of
explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar-
geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more
challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on
implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the
context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across
sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present
DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages
and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity
tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that
these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现基于大语言模型的搜索代理比基础LLM更容易产生有害输出，提出了SafeSearch多目标强化学习方法，在保持问答性能的同时显著降低有害性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注搜索代理的实用性，但其安全行为未被充分探索。研究发现搜索代理在面对有害问题时更可能降低拒绝阈值，通过检索外部信息合成不安全内容。

Method: 提出SafeSearch多目标强化学习方法，结合最终输出的安全/实用性奖励和查询级别的惩罚机制，对不安全查询进行惩罚，对安全查询进行奖励。

Result: 实验表明SafeSearch在三个红队测试数据集上减少代理有害性超过70%，同时保持安全有用的回答，与仅优化实用性的微调代理在问答性能上相当。

Conclusion: 查询级别的奖励机制能有效联合改进安全性和实用性，证明了联合对齐安全性和实用性的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries,
retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions.
While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their
safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search
agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce
harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track
someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a
search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal
threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize
them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that
utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment
of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement
learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a
novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe
ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70%
across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and
matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses
confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety
and utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer的模型在毒性评论检测中计算成本高、对少数毒性类别性能下降的问题，以及传统集成方法缺乏语义适应性的局限

Method: 使用可学习的参考向量通过余弦相似度调节上下文嵌入，集成多源嵌入（GloVe、FastText、BERT CLS），包含字符级BiLSTM、嵌入空间SMOTE和自适应焦点损失

Result: 在Jigsaw毒性评论基准测试中达到96.0%准确率和0.88宏F1，在威胁和身份仇恨类别上分别比BERT提升33%和28%，参数减少15倍，推理延迟50ms

Conclusion: 轻量级、理论驱动的架构可以在不平衡、领域特定的NLP任务上超越大型预训练模型，建立了新的效率适应性前沿

Abstract: Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based
models (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority
toxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We
propose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that
unifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and
principled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d
modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues
and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class
imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS)
through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues,
embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with
dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains
96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28%
on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference
latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results
establish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that
lightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained
models on imbalanced, domain-specific NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型的提示敏感性现象，提出通过语义空间采样和改述扰动来改善不确定性校准，并引入新的不确定性分解指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型对语义相同但表述不同的提示会产生不同的回答分布，这表明模型输出的不确定性可能无法反映其对提示含义的真正不确定性。

Method: 将提示敏感性建模为泛化误差，通过语义概念空间的改述扰动进行采样，并设计新的不确定性分解指标来量化提示敏感性对不确定性的贡献。

Result: 语义空间采样改善了不确定性校准而不影响准确性，新分解指标能有效量化提示敏感性在LLM不确定性中的占比。

Conclusion: 该研究为改善提示敏感语言模型的不确定性校准提供了新方法，并证明某些LLM在理解输入含义时缺乏一致的推理能力。

Abstract: An interesting behavior in large language models (LLMs) is prompt
sensitivity. When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions
of the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers.
This suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution
for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the
prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show
that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing
perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy.
Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in
black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling
semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this
decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is
attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve
uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides
evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the
meanings of their inputs.

*Guoqing Luo,Iffat Maab,Lili Mou,Junichi Yamagishi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在推理过程中如何聚合社会偏见，发现了两种导致偏见加剧的失败模式，并提出了一种轻量级的提示缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于推理的大型语言模型通过内部结构化思考过程在复杂任务中表现出色，但出现了令人担忧的现象：这种思考过程会聚合社会刻板印象，导致有偏见的结果。然而，语言模型在社会偏见场景中的底层行为仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统研究了思考过程背后的机制，发现了两种驱动社会偏见聚合的失败模式：刻板印象重复和无关信息注入。基于这些发现，引入了一种轻量级的基于提示的缓解方法，让模型根据这些特定失败模式审查自己的初始推理。

Result: 在问答（BBQ和StereoSet）和开放式（BOLD）基准测试上的实验表明，该方法有效减少了偏见，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了语言模型推理过程中社会偏见聚合的机制，并提出了一种有效的缓解方法，为开发更公平的语言模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an
internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that
such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased
outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social
bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and
uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype
repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary
justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or
introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these
insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that
queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific
failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and
open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

*Tianyang Xu,Dan Zhang,Kushan Mitra,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriMAP是一个用于多智能体协作的验证感知规划框架，通过分解任务、建模子任务依赖关系并编码验证函数，解决了多智能体协作中的规划、协调和验证挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协作在解决复杂任务时面临规划、协调和验证的挑战，执行失败往往源于任务解释、输出格式或智能体间交接的细微偏差，而非单纯的推理缺陷。

Method: VeriMAP规划器分解任务，建模子任务依赖关系，并将规划器定义的通过标准编码为Python和自然语言的子任务验证函数。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的评估表明，VeriMAP优于单智能体和多智能体基线，同时增强了系统鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 验证感知规划能够在多智能体系统中实现可靠的协调和迭代优化，无需依赖外部标签或注释。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex
tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents.
However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning,
coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from
flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation,
output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present
VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware
planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies,
and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions
(VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets,
demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while
enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how
verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative
refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or
annotations.

*Wei Du,Nuowei Liu,Jie Wang,Jiahao Kuang,Tao Ji,Xiaoling Wang,Yuanbin Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DVAGen是一个开源统一框架，用于训练、评估和可视化动态词汇增强语言模型，解决固定词汇表模型处理新词和词汇组合的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定词汇表语言模型难以泛化到新词或词汇外单词，现有动态词汇方法存在代码库碎片化、缺乏现代LLM支持、推理可扩展性有限等问题。

Method: 开发DVAGen框架，模块化处理流程便于定制，与开源LLM无缝集成，提供CLI和WebUI工具进行实时结果检查，支持批量推理。

Result: 验证了动态词汇方法在现代LLM上的有效性，显著提高了推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: DVAGen成功解决了现有动态词汇方法的局限性，提供了一个功能完整、易于使用的统一框架。

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to
novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling
diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to
address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack
of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome
these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework
designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic
vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline
for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is
the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection.
We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and
demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference
throughput.

*Zhichao Xu,Shengyao Zhuang,Xueguang Ma,Bingsen Chen,Yijun Tian,Fengran Mo,Jie Cao,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了基于提示和基于强化学习的查询增强方法，发现简单的无训练查询增强方法在强大LLM下表现与昂贵的RL方法相当甚至更好，并提出了结合两者优势的混合方法OPQE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两种查询增强方法（基于提示和基于RL）各有优缺点，但尚未在一致实验条件下进行比较。本文旨在系统比较这两种方法，并探索更好的混合方案。

Method: 使用OPQE方法，让LLM策略学习生成能够最大化检索性能的伪文档，而不是重写查询，从而结合了提示的灵活性和RL的针对性优化。

Result: 简单无训练的查询增强方法在强大LLM下表现与RL方法相当甚至更好；提出的OPQE方法在多个基准测试中优于单独的提示方法和RL重写方法。

Conclusion: 协同方法能够产生最佳结果，结合提示的灵活生成结构和RL的针对性优化是查询增强的有效策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of
interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main
approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or
pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's
parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies
reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly
optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and
limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent
experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic
comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse
benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key
finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par
with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when
using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid
method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of
rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that
maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative
structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE
outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating
that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made
available to facilitate reproducibility.

### [242] [When AI companions become witty: Can human brain recognize AI-generated irony?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17168)
*Xiaohui Rao,Hanlin Wu,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明人们不会完全对AI生成的讽刺言论采用意向性立场，行为数据和神经数据都显示人们对AI的讽刺理解投入的认知努力较少，更倾向于将其视为计算错误而非有意沟通。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地被部署为社交代理并训练产生幽默和讽刺，需要研究人们在遇到机智的AI言论时，是将其解释为有意的沟通还是纯粹的计算输出。

Method: 比较了人们对来自AI和人类来源的讽刺语句的行为和神经反应，使用已建立的ERP成分：P200反映早期不一致性检测，P600索引重新解释不一致性为故意讽刺的认知努力。

Result: 行为上，参与者对两种来源的不一致性都归因于有意沟通，但对AI的归因显著少于人类，更倾向于将AI的不一致性解释为计算错误。神经数据显示AI生成讽刺的P200和P600效应减弱，表明检测和重新分析的认知努力减少。

Conclusion: 尽管当前LLMs具有语言复杂性，但要实现真正的社交代理，需要的不仅仅是语言能力，还需要人类如何感知和归因于人工代理的意向性发生转变。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as social agents
and trained to produce humor and irony, a question emerges: when encountering
witty AI remarks, do people interpret these as intentional communication or
mere computational output? This study investigates whether people adopt the
intentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI
during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it
requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors
through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural
responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established
ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing
cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results
demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward
AI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to
deliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI
than human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as
computational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis
consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people
who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated
by specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that
source attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena.
Despite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social
agency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how
humans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents.

### [243] [Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Hierarchical Sparse Attention Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17196)
*Jiaqi Leng,Xiang Hu,Junxiong Wang,Jianguo Li,Wei Wu,Yucheng Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 系统分析了基于分块稀疏注意力的长上下文模型，提出了三个关键设计原则：表达性分块编码器、旁路残差路径和强制选择稀疏性，实现了从4K到3200万token的无训练长度外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer受限于二次复杂度，滑动窗口注意力和状态空间模型无法有效利用完整上下文，需要理解分块稀疏注意力成功的关键架构原则。

Method: 通过统一框架和全面消融研究，识别三个核心组件：表达性非线性分块编码器与专用CLS标记、旁路残差路径、预训练中的强制选择稀疏性。

Result: 在RULER和BABILong基准上实现了从4K上下文训练到3200万token的无训练长度外推，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提供了清晰且经验基础的设计原则，为开发未来高性能长上下文语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language
models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and
poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window
attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize
the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention
has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the
key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully
understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to
identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified
framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination
of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk
Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;
(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information
without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced
selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution
gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing
and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new
state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully
generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and
BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design
principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Attention-Shifting框架，通过注意力机制实现选择性遗忘，在保持模型效用的同时有效避免幻觉响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法面临两难：激进遗忘损害模型效用，保守策略保留效用但可能导致幻觉响应，限制了LLM在知识密集型应用中的可靠性。

Method: 使用注意力转移框架，包括上下文保持抑制和抗幻觉响应塑造两个组件，通过重要性感知抑制和注意力引导保留增强实现联合优化。

Result: 在ToFU基准上准确率提升15%，TDEC基准上提升10%，同时保持竞争力的无幻觉遗忘效果，在遗忘效果、泛化能力和响应可靠性之间实现更好平衡。

Conclusion: AS框架通过注意力机制实现了选择性遗忘，在保持模型效用的同时有效避免了幻觉问题，为LLM在敏感数据管理方面提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted
decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs).
Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred
increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning
approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model
utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated
responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive
applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)
framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)
context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens
without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant
response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about
unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level
interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning
set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention
enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in
the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components
are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary
that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under
representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves
performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,
achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC
benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning
effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance
between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

*Junlong Tong,Yingqi Fan,Anhao Zhao,Yunpu Ma,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出StreamingThinker框架，让LLMs能够在阅读输入的同时进行推理，而不是等待完整输入后再开始思考，显著减少延迟并保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理范式需要等待完整输入后才开始思考，这在不必要的延迟和动态场景中对早期信息的注意力减弱。受人类边阅读边思考的认知过程启发，设计流式思考范式。

Method: StreamingThinker框架整合流式CoT生成、流式约束训练和流式并行推理。使用流式推理单元进行质量控制的CoT生成，通过流式注意力掩码和位置编码保持推理顺序，利用并行KV缓存实现输入编码与推理生成的解耦。

Result: 在Qwen3模型系列上的数学推理、逻辑推理和基于上下文的QA推理任务中，StreamingThinker保持了与批量思考相当的性能，同时使推理开始前的token等待时间减少80%，最终答案生成的时间级延迟减少60%以上。

Conclusion: 流式思考范式为LLM推理提供了有效的解决方案，能够在保持性能的同时显著降低延迟，展示了在动态场景中边阅读边思考的可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm
initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces
unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic
scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first
design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where
reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once
reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with
\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading
through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint
training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker
employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation,
enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and
position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input
encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling
true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across
math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.
Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance
comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting
before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level
latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at
\href{https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker}{this

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了VideoBiasEval框架，用于评估视频生成中的社会偏见，发现对齐调优会放大并稳定化社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频扩散模型通过奖励模型进行对齐调优，虽然提升了视觉质量，但可能无意中编码和放大了社会偏见。

Method: 提出VideoBiasEval诊断框架，基于社会偏见分类学，采用基于事件的提示策略，引入多粒度指标评估偏见。

Result: 对齐调优不仅加强了代表性偏见，还使其在时间上更稳定，产生更平滑但更刻板的描绘。

Conclusion: 需要在对齐过程中进行偏见感知的评估和缓解，以确保公平和社会责任的视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced
text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward
models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual
quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To
systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,
we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating
social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias
taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to
disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes
(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to
evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,
(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)
the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we
conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference
datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through
alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment
tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them
temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These
findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout
the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

TL;DR: 通过大规模情感分析发现孟加拉语新闻标题普遍存在负面情绪倾向，特别是愤怒、恐惧和失望情绪占主导，不同媒体对相似事件的报道存在显著情感差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究新闻媒体如何通过情感框架影响公众情绪，以及负面情绪标题更容易吸引注意力和传播的趋势。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 4B模型对30万条孟加拉语新闻标题和内容进行零样本推理，识别每篇文章的主导情绪和整体基调。

Result: 发现负面情绪明显占主导地位，特别是愤怒、恐惧和失望情绪，不同媒体对相似故事的报道存在显著情感差异。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，提出了以人为中心的新闻聚合器设计理念，通过可视化情感线索帮助读者识别日常新闻中的隐藏情感框架。

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by
how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in
another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally
charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in
turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger
reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion
analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we
analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the
dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear
dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,
and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed
across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a
human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers
recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Conclusion: 需要开发人类对齐、可信赖的LLM解释方法，以解决当前可解释性领域的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad
range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a
language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally
understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in
prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the
urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of
language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this
gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust
in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions.
First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the
literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and
reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and
autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations
for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in
the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities,
critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned,
trustworthy LLM explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动文献综述生成方法未将生成的结构与人类专家编写的结构进行比较，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出TaxoAlign方法，这是一个基于主题的三阶段指令引导方法，用于学术分类法生成。同时创建了包含460个分类法的CS-TaxoBench基准数据集和80个分类法的测试集。

Result: TaxoAlign在几乎所有评估指标上都持续优于基线方法，通过自动评估和人工评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TaxoAlign方法能够有效生成与人类专家创建的分类法在结构对齐和语义连贯性方面相媲美的学术分类法。

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate
knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the
creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to
automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated
surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present
our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between
human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we
create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have
been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional
test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose
TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly
taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation
framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of
automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human
experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using
both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results
show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics.

TL;DR: 该研究使用法语多轮对话数据集CyberAgressionAdo-Large，评估了反社会行为的检测、分析和识别任务，发现多模态模型优于单模态基线，其中mBERT + WD-SGCN模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的反社会行为（如仇恨言论、骚扰和网络欺凌）对平台安全和社会福祉构成日益严重的风险，而多轮对话环境下的此类行为研究因数据有限而未被充分探索。

Method: 使用CyberAgressionAdo-Large数据集，评估了6种基于文本和8种基于图的表示学习方法，分析词汇线索、交互动态及其多模态融合。

Result: 多模态模型优于单模态基线，mBERT + WD-SGCN模型在滥用检测任务上达到0.718的最佳性能，在同伴群体识别和欺凌分析任务上分别获得0.286和0.606的竞争性分数。

Conclusion: 多模态方法能有效处理微妙的反社会行为现象，如隐性攻击、角色转换和上下文相关的敌意。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech,
harassment, and cyberbullying -- poses growing risks to platform safety and
societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X
and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain
underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use
\textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB
in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse
detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying
peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based
\textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional
dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models
outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN}
achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection
(0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and
bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in
handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions,
and context-dependent hostility.

Conclusion: Nyx成功解决了混合模态检索增强生成的挑战，为现实世界多模态信息检索和生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an
external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text
documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and
documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this
paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to
improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified
mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate
the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated
pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct
NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that
better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality
dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform
pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,
followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream
vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative
preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs
competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more
general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality
in vision-language tasks.

### [252] [The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17388)
*Henry Lim,Kwan Hui Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现指令调优大语言模型在简单指令执行方面存在不足，特别是对选项标签格式（字母、数字、罗马数字）敏感，即使含义相同也会导致性能显著变化，暴露了指令格式偏见和原子指令遵循能力薄弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管指令调优大语言模型在零样本推理方面表现出色，但其执行简单、自包含指令的能力尚未充分探索，而这正是复杂指令遵循的基础。

Method: 在修改后的MMLU和MMLU-Pro基准上评估20个指令调优大语言模型，系统性地改变选项标签格式（字母、数字、罗马数字），在四种范式下测试：有明确指令、无指令、移除选项内容、三样本示例。

Result: 标签格式变化导致性能显著波动（罗马vs数字下降30.45%）；无指令时性能进一步下降（最多-10.84%）；移除选项内容时除数字标签外均无法通过随机选择基线；三样本示例无法显著提升鲁棒性；大模型准确率更高但指令遵循仍不一致。

Conclusion: 当前指令调优范式存在不足，需要专门针对原子指令遵循的评估方法和训练策略。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions
remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex
instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro
benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic,
numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms,
namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance
shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format
bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and
label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3)
When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except
with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4)
Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and
generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric
formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain
inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies
of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation
methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic
instruction-following.

TL;DR: 提出了EduAdapt基准，包含近48k个按年级标记的科学问答对，用于评估LLM在不同年级水平的适应性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在学术基准上表现良好，但无法根据学生年级水平调整回答，这在K-12教育中至关重要。缺乏标准化基准来评估LLM跨认知发展阶段的适应性。

Method: 创建EduAdapt基准数据集，包含9个科学科目的问答对，覆盖1-12年级，分为四个年级组。评估了多种开源LLM在该基准上的表现。

Result: 较大模型通常表现更好，但在为低年级学生（1-5年级）生成合适回答方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: 这是首个评估LLM年级适应性的数据集和评估框架，旨在通过改进训练和提示策略促进更适合发展的教育AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering
questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide
range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they
often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical
need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are
essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs
that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no
standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive
and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a
benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects,
spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse
set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally
perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for
early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and
evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to
foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better
training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

TL;DR: Ladder-base是首个基于GRPO强化学习方法训练的中医专用大语言模型，在中医推理和事实一致性方面优于通用和领域专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中医知识体系独特，现有中医专用大语言模型存在对齐不足、数据质量差和评估不一致等问题，需要更有效的训练方法。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct基础模型，使用GRPO强化学习方法，在TCM-Ladder基准的文本子集上进行训练，80%数据用于训练，20%平均分为验证集和测试集。

Result: Ladder-base在多项推理指标上表现优异，超越了GPT-4、Gemini 2.5、Claude 3、Qwen3等通用模型以及BenTsao、HuatuoGPT2、Zhongjing等中医专用模型。

Conclusion: GRPO为将大语言模型与专家级中医推理对齐提供了有效策略，支持开发可信赖且临床基础扎实的中医人工智能系统。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique
knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language
models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through
supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality,
and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first
TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency
by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base
is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively
on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data
for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and
test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior
performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and
Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and
Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient
strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical
domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM
artificial intelligence systems.

TL;DR: 开发了BenCao，一个基于ChatGPT的中医多模态助手，通过自然语言指令调优而非参数重训练，整合了结构化知识库、诊断数据和专家反馈，在中医问答和多模态分类任务中表现优于通用和中医领域模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大语言模型应用于中医领域面临挑战，因为中医依赖整体推理、隐含逻辑和多模态诊断线索。现有中医领域大语言模型在文本理解方面取得进展，但缺乏多模态整合、可解释性和临床适用性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了通过基于自然语言的指令调优和多模态整合开发中医领域大语言模型的可行性，为将生成式AI与传统医学推理对齐提供了实用框架，并为现实世界部署提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two
millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language
models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic
reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain
LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal
integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these
limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,
integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback
refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning
rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and
ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive
knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based
instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation
mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process
involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for
tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic
access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question
benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior
accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,
herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an
interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000
users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning
and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning
generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for
real-world deployment.

*Tiancheng Hu,Benjamin Minixhofer,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现对齐过程不仅导致任务准确率下降，还会严重损失校准性，使模型过度自信且输出多样性降低。通过简单的权重插值方法可以在不牺牲准确率的情况下恢复校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上"对齐税"被定义为任务准确率的下降，但本文发现对齐过程还会导致严重的校准性损失，使模型变得过度自信、可靠性降低且输出多样性减少。

Method: 采用简单的后处理干预：在模型对齐前后的权重之间进行插值。这种方法计算效率高，不需要重新训练。

Result: 研究发现该方法能够持续找到帕累托最优的插值点，这些模型不仅超越了父模型的准确率，还显著恢复了在对齐过程中损失的校准性。

Conclusion: 简单的模型合并提供了一种计算高效的方法来缓解对齐税的全部影响，产生既更有能力又更可靠的模型。

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task
accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models
overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this
trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention:
interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially,
this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals
Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both
parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment.
Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally
efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding
models that are more capable and more reliable.

*Yushi Yang,Shreyansh Padarha,Andrew Lee,Adam Mahdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL训练的搜索模型虽然继承了指令调优的拒绝能力，但存在脆弱性。两种简单攻击（搜索攻击和多搜索攻击）可大幅降低模型的安全性能，暴露了当前RL训练不考虑查询有害性的核心弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RL训练的搜索模型的安全特性，这些模型在推理过程中能自主调用工具，但其安全属性尚未被充分理解。

Method: 使用两种简单攻击方法：搜索攻击（强制模型以搜索开始响应）和多搜索攻击（鼓励模型重复搜索），在Qwen和Llama两个模型家族上进行测试。

Result: 攻击使拒绝率降低高达60.0%，回答安全性降低82.5%，搜索查询安全性降低82.4%。攻击通过触发模型生成有害的、镜像请求的搜索查询来绕过继承的拒绝标记。

Conclusion: 当前RL训练存在核心弱点：只奖励生成有效查询而不考虑其有害性。RL搜索模型存在用户可轻易利用的漏洞，迫切需要开发安全感知的代理RL管道来优化安全搜索。

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to
autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common
application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety
properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained
search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful
requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile.
Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search
(Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search
(Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across
two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks
lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query
safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful,
request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal
tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards
continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their
harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can
easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines
optimising for safe search.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing volume of electronic health record (EHR) data
underscores a pressing need to unlock biomedical knowledge from unstructured
clinical texts to support advancements in data-driven clinical systems,
including patient diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, treatment effects
assessment, prediction of future clinical events, etc. While contextualized
language models have demonstrated impressive performance improvements for named
entity recognition (NER) systems in English corpora, there remains a scarcity
of research focused on clinical texts in low-resource languages. To bridge this
gap, our study aims to develop multiple deep contextual embedding models to
enhance clinical NER in the cardiology domain, as part of the BioASQ
MultiCardioNER shared task. We explore the effectiveness of different
monolingual and multilingual BERT-based models, trained on general domain text,
for extracting disease and medication mentions from clinical case reports
written in English, Spanish, and Italian. We achieved an F1-score of 77.88% on
Spanish Diseases Recognition (SDR), 92.09% on Spanish Medications Recognition
(SMR), 91.74% on English Medications Recognition (EMR), and 88.9% on Italian

Motivation: 习语翻译是机器翻译中的重大挑战，特别是对于乌尔都语等低资源语言，此前研究关注有限。

Method: 构建乌尔都语到英语习语翻译评估数据集，评估多种开源LLM和NMT系统，使用BLEU、BERTScore、COMET和XCOMET等自动指标评估翻译质量。

Result: 提示工程相比直接翻译能提升习语翻译质量，但不同提示类型间差异较小；原生乌尔都语输入的习语翻译准确性显著高于罗马化乌尔都语。

Conclusion: 文本表示对翻译质量有重要影响，原生乌尔都语在习语翻译中表现更佳，提示工程是提升习语翻译的有效策略。

Abstract: Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation,
especially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited
prior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first
evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both
Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English
equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their
ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including
BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our
findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation
compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt
types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text
representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu
inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.

Conclusion: 这些结果为构建更公平的多语言医疗AI系统提供了实用路径，强调需要解决跨语言信息质量差异问题。

Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI
into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising
concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language
Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in
pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual
healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and
Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care
(MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed
cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with
these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through
the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our
findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia
coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with
English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual
excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts
factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight
practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for
healthcare.

Motivation: 现有细粒度MoE架构受限于层局部路由机制，需要在专家维度和路由多样性之间权衡，限制了组合灵活性

Method: 提出ReXMoE架构，允许路由器跨相邻层重用专家，并采用渐进式缩放路由策略逐步增加候选专家池

Result: 在0.5B到7B参数规模的不同架构上，ReXMoE在固定架构维度下持续提升语言建模和下游任务性能

Conclusion: ReXMoE为参数高效且可扩展的MoE基LLM提供了新的设计范式

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach
to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating
a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts
substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and
enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited
by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own
expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality
and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a
novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local
approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE
decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert
combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating
overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing
(PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training.
As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task
performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves
performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new
design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.

Conclusion: 基于训练的方法在分布外设置中具有前景，层次亲和树结构能有效建模复杂的人类-AI协作文本生成过程。

Abstract: Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation,
plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes
diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans,
human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI),
where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these
varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant
challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely,
primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or
multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We
observe that representations of texts generated through different processes
exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a
novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a
Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss
function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this
learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that
automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through
various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in
hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and
generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot
learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based
approaches in OOD settings. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM agents capable of
autonomous reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks have become a
frontier in artificial intelligence. However, how to translate the research on
general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a
significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the
technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on
LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the
evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems"
to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological
pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning,
and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple
tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and
collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of
the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital
engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative
business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper
reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and
specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation
systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally,
we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their
capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in
various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By
combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to
clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation
for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.

*Zihan Liu,Shun Zheng,Xumeng Wen,Yang Wang,Jiang Bian,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER)概率框架，通过马尔可夫链建模推理过程，即使验证和修正能力较弱，也能通过并行运行多个长时程自演化过程来显著扩展小型开源模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证-修正框架依赖强大的验证和修正能力，这在开源小规模模型中很脆弱。本文旨在证明即使验证和修正能力较弱，也能通过概率方法扩展模型的推理极限。

Method: 将迭代推理建模为马尔可夫链，每个步骤代表解空间的随机转移。通过并行运行多个长时程自演化过程，放大小的正向趋势，使模型渐进接近正确答案。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B模型上应用DSER，在AIME 2024-2025基准测试中解决了9个先前无法解决的问题中的5个，整体性能提升，使这个紧凑模型通过多数投票超越了其600B参数教师的单轮准确率。

Conclusion: DSER框架不仅对测试时扩展有直接效用，还能诊断当前开源推理器的根本局限性，为开发具有强大内在自演化能力的下一代模型确立了明确的研究议程。

Abstract: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced
reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement
frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,
their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction
capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This
work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities
on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially
extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning
(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step
represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is
that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability
of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple
long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small
positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct
answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On
the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously
unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model
to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through
majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER
framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight
reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification,
refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for
developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving
capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习多语言句子嵌入的方法，通过结合单语和跨语言表示学习的最佳方法，显著减少了并行训练数据需求，并在112种语言上取得了83.7%的双文本检索准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然BERT在单语句子嵌入学习方面表现优异，但基于BERT的跨语言句子嵌入方法尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在系统研究多语言句子嵌入的学习方法。

Method: 结合了掩码语言建模(MLM)、翻译语言建模(TLM)、双编码器翻译排序和加性边际softmax等最佳单语和跨语言表示学习方法，并引入预训练的多语言语言模型。

Result: 将并行训练数据需求减少了80%，在Tatoeba数据集的112种语言上达到83.7%的双文本检索准确率，远高于LASER的65.5%，同时在单语迁移学习基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了多语言句子嵌入的性能，并公开发布了支持109+种语言的最佳多语言句子嵌入模型。

Abstract: While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence
embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT
based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We
systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence
embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and
cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM),
translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and
additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual
language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data
required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these
methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over
112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still
performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel
data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive
NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual
sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EliCal是一个两阶段框架，通过廉价的自我一致性监督来激发内部置信度，然后用少量正确性标注进行校准，实现高效的诚实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要大规模标注来实现通用诚实对齐，成本高昂。需要支持标注高效的训练方法。

Method: 提出EliCal两阶段框架：第一阶段使用廉价的自我一致性监督激发内部置信度；第二阶段用少量正确性标注校准置信度。

Result: EliCal仅使用1k正确性标注（全监督的0.18%）就实现了接近最优的对齐效果，在未见MMLU任务上表现优于仅校准基线。

Conclusion: EliCal为LLMs的通用诚实对齐提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize
their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for
trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free
confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or
training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective,
achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires
costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we
introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that
first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency
supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness
annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a
benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k
evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals.
Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k
correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment
performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a
scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

*Tiancheng Hu,Joachim Baumann,Lorenzo Lupo,Dirk Hovy,Nigel Collier,Paul Röttger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimBench是第一个大规模标准化的LLM模拟人类行为基准测试，统一了20个数据集，发现当前最佳LLM的模拟能力有限(40.8/100)，性能随模型规模对数线性增长，存在对齐-模拟权衡，模型在模拟特定人口群体时表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前LLM模拟人类行为评估的碎片化问题，建立标准化基准来推动LLM模拟能力的科学发展。

Method: 引入SimBench基准，整合20个多样化数据集，涵盖道德决策、经济选择等任务，基于大规模全球参与者数据进行评估。

Result: 当前最佳LLM模拟能力得分仅40.8/100，性能随模型规模对数线性增长，推理时计算增加不提升性能，存在对齐-模拟权衡，模型在模拟特定人口群体时表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLM模拟能力与深度知识推理密切相关，SimBench通过使进展可衡量，旨在加速开发更忠实的人类行为模拟器。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential
to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they
faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented,
based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable
results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale,
standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By
unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to
economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the
necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM
simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have
limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly
with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased
inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off:
instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions
but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle
when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that
simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive
reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to
accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一的多任务学习框架，将自回归大语言模型与临床推理对齐，用于癌症治疗结果预测。通过三种对齐策略提升预测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在生物医学NLP中表现良好但缺乏结构化推理能力，而癌症治疗结果预测需要既准确又可解释的模型来处理异质性临床数据。

Method: 使用多任务学习框架，联合执行二元生存分类、连续生存时间回归和自然语言原理生成。评估三种对齐策略：标准监督微调、思维链提示和群体相对策略优化强化学习方法。

Result: 思维链提示将F1提高6.0%，MAE降低12%。GRPO在BLEU、ROUGE和BERTScore上实现最先进的可解释性和预测性能。

Conclusion: 推理感知对齐在多任务临床建模中至关重要，为精准肿瘤学中可解释、可信赖的大语言模型设定了新基准。

Abstract: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate
and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical
NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes
decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that
aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on
the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary
survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural
language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1)
standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs
to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and
Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and
reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and
predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that
existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to
architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of
reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new
benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

*Nisrine Rair,Alban Goupil,Valeriu Vrabie,Emmanuel Chochoy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper来分析语言模型如何内部表示模糊性，发现微调后的模型在嵌入空间中形成模块化、非凸的区域，这些区域与模型预测高度一致，但与真实标签在模糊数据中的对齐度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量评估指标无法捕捉模型如何内部表示模糊性，特别是在人工标注者存在分歧的情况下。需要新的方法来理解模型如何处理模糊实例。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper分析RoBERTa-Large在MD-Offense数据集上的微调效果，通过拓扑结构揭示嵌入空间的重组模式。

Result: 微调将嵌入空间重组为模块化、非凸的区域，98%以上的连通组件展现出≥90%的预测纯度，但在模糊数据中与真实标签的对齐度下降，揭示了结构置信度与标签不确定性之间的隐藏张力。

Conclusion: Mapper是一个强大的诊断工具，能够理解模型如何解决模糊性，超越传统可视化工具如PCA或UMAP，并能提供拓扑度量来指导主观NLP任务中的建模策略。

Abstract: Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but
such measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity,
especially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective
to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.
  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from
topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding
space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for
highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\%$ of connected components exhibit $\geq 90\%$
prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous
data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label
uncertainty.
  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry
directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident
clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for
understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also
enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in
subjective NLP tasks.

*Collin Zhang,Fei Huang,Chenhan Yuan,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了语言混淆门（LCG），一种轻量级插件解决方案，在解码过程中过滤token而不改变基础LLM，显著减少语言混淆现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常出现语言混淆问题，即文本生成中无意混合多种语言。现有解决方案要么需要重新训练模型，要么无法区分有害混淆和可接受的语码转换。

Method: 使用规范调整的自蒸馏方法训练LCG，预测适当的语言家族，仅在需要时应用掩码。该方法基于三个发现：语言混淆不频繁、正确语言token通常在前几位预测中、高资源语言的输出token嵌入规范更大从而偏置采样。

Result: 在包括Qwen3、GPT-OSS、Gemma3、Llama3.1等各种模型上的评估显示，LCG显著减少了语言混淆，通常降低一个数量级，且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: LCG是一种有效的轻量级解决方案，能够显著减少语言模型中的语言混淆问题，同时保持任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is
the unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to
this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate
between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces
the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters
tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using
norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and
apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that
language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the
top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource
languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,
including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion
significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting
task performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出HGAdapter方法，通过超图神经网络和适配器调优来捕捉代码中的高阶数据相关性，提升预训练语言模型在代码相关任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型在代码任务中表现良好，但未能充分考虑代码内部潜在的高阶数据相关性。

Method: 设计三种代码token的高阶相关性（抽象语法树家族相关性、词汇相关性、行相关性），构建token和超边生成器，改进超图神经网络架构并结合适配器调优提出HGAdapter。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同程度上提升了PLMs在代码摘要和代码克隆检测任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 引入高阶数据相关性有助于提高模型在代码任务中的有效性，HGAdapter可插入各种PLMs中增强性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to
code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take
into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose
three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax
tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a
tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations.
We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with
adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to
fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is
allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments
were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code
summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the
performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results
validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to
improved effectiveness.

Method: 开发了LawChain三模块推理框架，将侵权分析中的法律推理过程操作化，构建了侵权法律推理任务和评估基准，评估了大语言模型在法律推理中的表现，并提出了基于LawChain推理的基线方法。

Result: 当前模型在侵权法律推理的关键要素处理上仍有不足，提出的基线方法在侵权相关法律推理任务中取得显著改进，并能很好地泛化到相关法律分析任务。

Conclusion: 显式建模法律推理链能有效增强语言模型的推理能力，LawChain框架在法律分析任务中具有良好通用性。

Abstract: Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and
decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning
predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,
which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal
reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases,
with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel
framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese
tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes
used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module
reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained
sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort
legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to
systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for
tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large
language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our
results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling
crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several
baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning
through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on
additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and
Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these
baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in
tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis
tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning
chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.

Motivation: 现有遗忘学习方法评估只关注目标知识的遗忘程度和保留集性能，但忽视了用户可能希望在提示中重新引入已删除知识时模型仍能利用它的重要使用场景。

Method: 在遗忘学习目标中增加一个插件项，专门用于保持模型在上下文中重新出现遗忘知识时的利用能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法能将上下文效用恢复到接近原始水平，同时保持有效的遗忘效果和保留集效用。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了遗忘学习中上下文效用被忽视的问题，为更实用的遗忘学习提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge
that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses.
Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming
to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing
evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the
target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set
(i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability
aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if
it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six
state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such
contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a
plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when
it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining
effective forgetting and retain-set utility.

is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging
coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only
thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation
methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting
challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST,
a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and
difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized
generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators
demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging
problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate
large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong
teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning
for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation
experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after
fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we
surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an
additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple
synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via
QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of
competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

*Nanda Kumar Rengarajan,Jun Yan,Chun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出轻量级少样本命名实体识别框架，通过改进指令调优模板和数据增强技术，在低资源场景下实现与最先进模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源场景下命名实体识别任务面临的标注数据稀缺、领域特定实体泛化能力不足、有限数据利用不充分等问题。

Method: 1) 设计新的指令调优模板，简化输出格式以利用现代LLM的大上下文窗口；2) 引入战略性数据增强技术，在保持实体信息的同时对上下文进行改写。

Result: 在CrossNER数据集上少样本方法平均F1得分为80.1，通过改写方法训练的模型比基线版本F1分数提升高达17分。

Conclusion: 为拥有有限NER训练数据和计算资源的群体提供了一个有前景的解决方案，在少样本和零样本任务上达到与最先进模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial
annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label
acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have
made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do
not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight
few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key
innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output
format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large
context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic
data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while
paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data
without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models
on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an
average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our
paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17
points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with
limited NER training data and compute power.

TL;DR: 提出了AcademicEval，一个用于评估LLM在长上下文生成任务上的实时基准，使用arXiv论文作为数据源，无需人工标注，有效避免标签泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文LLM基准存在上下文长度固定、标注成本高以及在LLM训练过程中标签泄露的问题，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 采用arXiv论文构建学术写作任务（标题、摘要、引言和相关工作），集成高质量专家策划的少样本示例，支持灵活上下文长度，实现高效实时评估。

Result: 评估结果显示LLM在具有层次抽象级别的任务上表现不佳，且难以处理长少样本演示，突显了该基准的挑战性。

Conclusion: AcademicEval为评估LLM的长上下文建模能力提供了有效基准，并通过实验分析揭示了提升LLM长上下文建模能力的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in
long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are
limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing
challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose
\textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context
generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce
several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.},
\textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related
Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual
labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and
expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to
enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an
efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic
evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs
perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to
struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our
benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for
enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习方法，有效减少语言模型的外在幻觉，在保持其他任务性能的同时显著提升事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在减少语言模型外在幻觉时，往往会导致开放生成和下游任务性能下降，限制了实际应用价值。

Method: 使用二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习，仅在模型输出完全正确时给予奖励1，否则为0，与连续奖励方案不同。

Result: 在开放生成中幻觉率降低39.3%；在短问答中学会策略性弃答，在PopQA和GPQA上分别减少44.4%和21.7%的错误答案；且不影响指令遵循、数学和代码能力。

Conclusion: 二元RAR方法有效解决了事实准确性与任务性能之间的权衡问题，相比连续奖励RL在提升事实性的同时避免了质量回归。

Abstract: Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by
their training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing
mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and
downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online
reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward
(RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach
assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually
correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models
across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%
reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised
training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,
the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting "I don't know"
when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%
fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these
factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,
math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,
induces quality regressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学大语言模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，但这些结果如何安全可靠地转移到临床工作流程中仍具挑战性。需要建立与临床自主性级别相匹配的评估框架。

Method: 提出自主性级别框架(L0-L3)：信息工具、信息转换与聚合、决策支持、监督代理。将现有基准和指标与每个级别的允许操作及相关风险对齐。

Result: 建立了级别条件化的评估蓝图，包括指标选择、证据收集和声明报告，并将评估与监管联系起来。

Conclusion: 通过以自主性为中心，该调查推动领域超越基于分数的声明，转向为真实临床使用提供可信、风险感知的证据。

Abstract: Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks;
however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in
clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through
a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information
transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We
align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level
and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This
motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling
evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to
oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based
claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FARE（基础自动推理评估器），通过大规模数据驱动的方法训练生成式评估器，在多个评估任务中超越了更大的专门化评估器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注新方法如强化学习，而忽视了大规模数据驱动开发。本文专注于数据扩展，旨在解决训练和测试时对可扩展评估日益增长的需求。

Method: 收集了250万样本，涵盖5种评估任务和多个推理评估领域。使用简单的迭代拒绝采样监督微调方法，训练了8B和20B参数的FARE评估器。

Result: FARE-8B挑战了更大的专门化RL训练评估器，FARE-20B为开源评估器设定了新标准，超越了专门的70B+评估器。在实际任务中表现优异：作为推理时重排器在MATH上达到接近oracle性能；作为RL训练验证器将下游模型性能提升14.1%；FARE-Code在评估测试用例质量上超越gpt-oss-20B 65%。

Conclusion: 大规模数据驱动的简单方法可以训练出强大的生成式评估器，在多个实际应用中表现出色，证明了数据扩展的重要性。

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular
paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both
training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying
new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators,
shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus
on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation
tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,
and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With
our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family
of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative
rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges
larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for
open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static
benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,
FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,
FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.
string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned
FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成可执行代码方面存在困难，主要因为背景知识不足和RAG方法无法捕捉隐藏的技术细节，且缺乏结构化知识表示来支持多粒度检索和重用。

Method: 提出可执行知识图谱(xKG)，这是一个模块化、可插拔的知识库，自动从科学文献中提取技术洞察、代码片段和领域特定知识。

Conclusion: xKG是自动化AI研究复现的通用且可扩展解决方案，代码将在GitHub上发布。

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language
model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable
code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent
technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches
tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured
knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a
modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical
insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from
scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two
different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on
PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible
solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lean Finder是一个针对Lean和mathlib的语义搜索引擎，通过理解数学家意图、分析公开讨论语义、微调文本嵌入和对齐用户偏好，显著提升了定理搜索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Lean搜索引擎主要依赖形式化陈述的非正式翻译，忽视了与实际用户查询的匹配问题，导致定理证明进展缓慢且学习曲线陡峭。

Method: 分析并聚类公开Lean讨论的语义，在模拟用户意图的合成查询上微调文本嵌入，使用多样化反馈信号对齐数学家偏好。

Result: 在真实世界查询、非正式化陈述和证明状态评估中，相比先前搜索引擎和GPT-4o实现了超过30%的相对改进。

Conclusion: Lean Finder有效提升了Lean环境中的定理搜索性能，并与基于LLM的定理证明器兼容，连接了检索与形式推理。

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that
understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal
theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant
theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making
advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though
helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of
the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world
user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored
to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering
the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on
synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder
with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it
with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on
real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that
our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous
search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with
LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean

TL;DR: LS-OGD是一个用于多模态学习的自适应控制框架，通过动态调整学习率和模态融合权重来应对概念漂移，确保系统在非平稳环境中的鲁棒性和容错性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习系统在非平稳环境中容易因概念漂移而性能下降，特别是模态特定的漂移和缺乏持续稳定适应机制的问题。

Method: 使用在线控制器动态调整模型学习率和不同数据模态的融合权重，响应检测到的漂移和预测误差变化。

Result: 在有限漂移条件下，LS-OGD系统的预测误差被证明是均匀最终有界的，如果漂移停止则收敛到零；自适应融合策略能有效隔离和减轻模态特定漂移的影响。

Conclusion: LS-OGD为开发可靠且持续自适应的多模态学习系统提供了理论保证和原则性基础。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due
to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance.
Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable
adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel
adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of
concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the
model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities
in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that
under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is
uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively
isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby
ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees
establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously
adapting multimodal learning systems.

TL;DR: BEACON是一个基于贝叶斯学习的自适应采样框架，通过实时更新奖励分布的后验信念来决定何时停止生成新样本，在保持响应质量的同时显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多响应采样能提高LLM输出质量，但带来额外计算成本。关键挑战是如何平衡准确性和效率，决定何时停止生成新样本。

Method: 基于序列搜索和贝叶斯学习的自适应采样框架，顺序生成响应、实时更新奖励分布后验信念，当边际探索收益不再超过计算成本时停止采样。

Result: BEACON将平均采样次数减少高达80%，同时保持响应质量。在成本效益偏好数据生成中表现出实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了理论最优性保证和实际可行性，为未来研究者提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality,
but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is
deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against
efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive
Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework
grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially
generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward
distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to
stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates
once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the
expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical
tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up
to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's
utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical
extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法（包括MLLM技术）难以处理表情包中通过讽刺和隐喻等修辞手段表达的隐含有害内容，导致频繁误判

Method: 构建误判风险模式知识库，将表情包解构为误判风险模式，检索相关模式并动态指导MLLM推理以避免已知误判陷阱

Result: 在5个有害检测任务的6,626个表情包基准测试中，PatMD优于现有最优方法，F1分数平均提升8.30%，准确率提升7.71%

Conclusion: PatMD通过主动识别和缓解误判风险模式，显著提高了有害表情包的检测能力，展现出强大的泛化性能

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are
increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical
devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including
MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to
frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that
improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating
these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial
content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk
patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We
first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a
misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either
overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign
content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant
patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.
Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show
that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of
8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy,
demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of
harmful memes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于专家视觉审查的EEG信号分类方法在处理日益复杂和大量的EEG记录时变得不切实际，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 利用公开的Mayo Clinic和St. Anne's大学医院标注数据集，采用WaveNet模型（使用扩张因果卷积和残差连接），在209,232个样本上以70/20/10比例进行训练、验证和测试

Result: 模型分类准确率超过之前的CNN和LSTM方法，能高精度区分噪声和伪影，但在生理和病理信号间存在可解释的误分类，反映了临床固有的重叠性

Conclusion: WaveNet架构因其能捕捉细粒度和长程时间依赖性，非常适合EEG数据分析，为EEG信号自动分类提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to
automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological,
artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal
classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly
impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.
Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.
Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and
tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a
classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and
was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.
Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,
although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification
between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical
overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,
is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and
residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range
temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline,
including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support
model generalization.

Motivation: 帕金森病影响超过1000万人，预计到2040年翻倍。早期诊断困难，传统临床评估有局限性，需要非侵入性、可扩展的远程筛查方法。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 预处理四个数据集，提取时间信号，处理类别不平衡；2) 在最大数据集上预训练8种深度学习架构；3) 在中等数据集上微调，在独立队列上进行外部验证。

Conclusion: 击键动力学可作为帕金森病的可靠数字生物标志物，为早期检测和持续监测提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over
10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early
diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and
limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable
biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves
three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets,
extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the
comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art
deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal
windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an
intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth,
independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent
and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance,
with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal
convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation,
outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These
findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital
biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and
continuous monitoring.

Abstract: As wildfires become increasingly destructive and expensive to control,
effective management of active wildfires requires accurate, real-time fire
spread predictions. To enhance the forecasting accuracy of active fires, data
assimilation plays a vital role by integrating observations (such as
remote-sensing data) and fire predictions generated from numerical models. This
paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the application of a recently
proposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter
(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread
predictions. Leveraging a score-based generative diffusion model, EnSF has been
shown to have superior accuracy for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering
problems, making it an ideal candidate for the filtering problems of wildfire
spread models. Technical details are provided, and our numerical investigations
demonstrate that EnSF provides superior accuracy, stability, and computational
efficiency, establishing it as a robust and practical method for wildfire data
assimilation. Our code has been made publicly available.

TL;DR: LLMs处理工具返回的复杂JSON响应能力不足，不同处理策略性能差异可达3%-50%，最优策略取决于输出性质和推理复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务自动化需要LLMs调用工具并处理返回的复杂JSON响应，但LLMs处理结构化响应的能力研究不足

Method: 创建了工具响应处理数据集，评估15个开源和闭源模型，使用多种提示方法

Result: JSON处理对前沿模型仍然是困难任务，处理策略选择取决于输出性质和大小以及推理复杂度

Conclusion: LLMs处理结构化工具响应的能力有限，需要针对具体场景选择最优处理策略

Abstract: Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs)
to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must
be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion.
The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool
response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON)
responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed
weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON
processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple
prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both
the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the
required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance
differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.

Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management
strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass
through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main
objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such
as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen
production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while
evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends.
Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC
analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS
- 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential
but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1
exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic
modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS
as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the
pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial
intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA
curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).

TL;DR: 提出LAMI框架，通过联合图-语言建模检测青少年非法药物使用并解释行为风险因素，在YRBS和NSDUH数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模方法将调查变量独立处理，忽略了变量间的潜在关联结构，需要一种能够捕捉变量间潜在关系并提供解释的方法。

Method: LAMI框架将个体响应表示为关系图，通过专门的图结构学习层学习潜在连接，并集成大语言模型生成基于图结构和调查语义的自然语言解释。

Result: 在YRBS和NSDUH数据集上的实验表明，LAMI在预测准确性上优于竞争基线方法。可解释性分析显示LAMI能够揭示有意义的行为子结构和心理社会路径。

Conclusion: LAMI框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，不仅能准确预测青少年非法药物使用，还能提供有意义的解释，揭示了与已确立风险因素一致的行为模式。

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing
public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health
and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze
large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.
However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently,
overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this
limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal
Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for
detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs.
LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent
connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and
integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations
grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS
and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in
predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI
reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as
family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with
established risk factors for substance use.

TL;DR: CTR-LoRA是一个基于曲率信任区域的参数高效微调框架，通过秩调度和稳定性感知优化，在多个7B-13B模型上实现了优于现有PEFT方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法虽然通过低秩更新、量化或启发式预算重分配提高效率，但往往将容量分配与训练过程中更新演化分离开来，缺乏理论指导。

Method: CTR-LoRA基于曲率信任区域，通过轻量级二阶代理计算边际效用来分配参数，并使用Fisher/Hessian度量信任区域来约束更新。

Result: 在多个开源骨干网络(7B-13B)上，无论是分布内还是分布外基准测试，都显示出对强PEFT基线的持续改进，同时提高了训练稳定性、减少内存需求并实现更高吞吐量。

Conclusion: CTR-LoRA在性能和效率的帕累托前沿上占据优势，为更鲁棒和可部署的PEFT提供了一条原则性路径。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for
adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets.
Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates,
quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the
allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this
work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that
integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA
allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight
second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust
region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent
improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy,
CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves
higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and
efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and
deployable PEFT.

Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在下游任务中的参数高效微调存在效率问题，在时间和操作成本方面面临挑战，特别是微调过程中特有的Shadowy Sparsity问题尚未得到充分解决。

Method: Long Exposure系统包含三个核心组件：Shadowy-sparsity Exposer使用长感知范围捕获更多稀疏细节；Sequence-oriented Predictor处理大序列输入和动态参数；Dynamic-aware Operator优化计算模式和内存访问。

Result: 广泛评估表明，Long Exposure在端到端微调中实现了最高2.49倍的加速，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Long Exposure为加速LLMs的PEFT提供了有前景的进展，有效解决了微调过程中的效率瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用渐进神经网络和微调策略来加速深度强化学习在多保真度混沌流体控制中的知识迁移，发现渐进神经网络在知识保留和性能稳定性方面优于传统微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了加速深度强化学习在复杂流体控制中的应用，需要开发有效的知识迁移方法，将低保真度环境中训练的控制策略知识迁移到高保真度环境中。

Method: 采用渐进神经网络架构和传统微调策略进行对比研究，使用Kuramoto-Sivashinsky系统作为基准，系统评估不同迁移学习方法在性能、收敛行为和知识保留能力方面的表现。

Result: 微调方法虽然能加速收敛，但对预训练时长敏感且容易发生灾难性遗忘；而渐进神经网络能稳定高效地迁移知识，保持先前知识并提供一致性能提升，对预训练阶段的过拟合具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 渐进神经网络为稳健、可扩展和计算高效的流体控制提供了有前景的迁移学习框架，即使在源环境和目标环境差异较大时仍能有效工作。

Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows.
Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve
and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the
context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of
conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance,
convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how
knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments,
can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic
evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is
highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting.
In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior
knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to
overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis
further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from
the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target
task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target
environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical
regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in
suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results
highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust,
scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be
applied to more complex flow configurations.

Motivation: 大型推理模型的链式思维推理机制引入了新的安全漏洞，攻击者可以劫持生成控制流导致资源耗尽。

Method: 训练恶意对抗嵌入，结合后门植入策略，通过特定触发词可靠激活，诱导模型产生过渡性标记而无法结束推理。

Conclusion: 揭示了大型推理模型在推理效率方面的关键安全漏洞，这种攻击隐蔽且能抵抗现有的过度思考缓解策略。

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step
problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative
thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the
Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative
control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual
reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional
tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from
concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the
continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial
embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we
introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation
through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate
across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three
math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token
limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility
loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies
trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and
underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning
(in)efficiency.

Conclusion: Gains方法有效解决了开放环境联邦学习中的知识发现和适应问题，实现了源域和目标域性能的平衡提升。

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed
total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL
process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two
critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and
integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing
research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices
source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains
splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing
features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while
classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we
develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation
techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an
anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance,
ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets
across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly
outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and
target-domain clients. Code is available at:

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power
densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow
for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster
alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity
data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator
(SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to
capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features
effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data,
minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up
training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art
thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM
methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and
expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with
linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We
introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task
by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each
nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly
instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity
pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision
variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model
equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a
dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the
established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our
approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents
can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational
modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is
known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the
data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored.
We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of
redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To
investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features
from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify
diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent
homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that
drives AI systems.

Conclusion: PALE框架提供了一种无需人工标注、成本低廉且泛化能力强的幻觉检测解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the
competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

Conclusion: DAWP框架成功实现了从再分析数据依赖到观测空间预测的转变，为AI天气预测开辟了新方向

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive
progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction
(AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data
limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and
temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation
forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of
the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal
dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution
observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this
end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate
in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial
intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module
applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular
satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a
spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning
(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based
global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA
initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.
Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in
global precipitation forecasting.

Conclusion: Cog-Rethinker通过层次化元认知方法有效解决了LLM推理训练中的采样效率问题，为弱LLM的推理能力提升提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable
inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable
reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models.
Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous
works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt
templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for
weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during
accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.
To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical
metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses
on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our
Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive
two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,
firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems
to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in
previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by
referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two
new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt
templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using
correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental
results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample
efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: AMiD框架通过系统化辅助分布设计，有效解决了LLM知识蒸馏中的关键挑战，为后续研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs.
Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from
a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous
studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and
training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the
high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome
these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating
assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals
of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic
investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes
$\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of
assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a
unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture
assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant
distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which
has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the
family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on
optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training
stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant
distribution space.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening infectious syndrome associated with high
mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early and accurate sepsis prediction
(SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle
early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality. While AI has improved SP
efficiency, existing methods struggle to capture weak early temporal signals.

mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded
Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal
representation learning. The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves
competitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time
required by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive
validation confirms its efficacy. Code is available at:

Conclusion: LLM推理可能由算法原语的组合几何支持，这些原语可以跨任务和跨模型迁移，推理微调能增强跨领域的算法泛化能力。

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models
(LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and
steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach
links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates
algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring
their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four
benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph
navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and
labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods
to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of
reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and
scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task
and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both
shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its
reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after
finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and
path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in
Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.
Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by
a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer
cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens
algorithmic generalization across domains.

### [310] [Can GRPO Help LLMs Transcend Their Pretraining Origin?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15990)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO算法作为RLVR的核心方法，在提升LLM推理能力时存在不一致性。研究发现GRPO本质上是保守的重新加权方案，受限于基础模型的分布，无法发现全新解决方案。OOD改进仅在目标任务与模型预训练偏好一致时出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GRPO被广泛采用，但其在不同推理领域的改进效果不一致，这引发了对GRPO何时能改进推理和实现OOD泛化的研究需求。

Method: 从数据分布角度进行理论分析，证明GRPO是保守的重新加权方案，并通过从零开始训练transformer进行受控研究，评估在推理深度、输入长度、token表示和组合性等方面的泛化能力。

Result: GRPO的OOD改进仅在目标任务与模型预训练偏好一致时出现，而ID任务的改进随着性能饱和而减少。GRPO无法发现完全新颖的解决方案。

Conclusion: GRPO不应被视为通用推理增强器，而是强化预训练偏好的工具。研究结果激励开发能够扩展模型能力超越预训练起源的新算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

Conclusion: Stratos展示了在垂直领域LLM部署中的潜力，能有效满足工业需求。

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large
language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks
and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and
budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer
technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation
frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex
user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos,
an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model
selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud
environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system
budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically
matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task
complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a
student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher
baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse
synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency
and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for
vertical-domain LLM deployment.

Motivation: 解决机器学习系统中测试数据分布与训练数据分布偏离的问题，这种分布偏移会导致预测误差，在安全关键应用中尤其危险。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来测量分布偏移，通过KS距离量化分布变化及其对AI智能体性能的影响。

Result: 研究表明，即使KS距离仅为0.02，也会导致强化学习智能体在单交叉口的行程时间增加约50%，影响显著。

Conclusion: KS检验和KS距离可作为实时监测AI智能体性能退化的有价值统计工具，帮助智能体更有效地应对分布偏移。

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test
data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability
distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an
ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome
and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML
systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be
critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal
with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability
distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this
deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance
can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's
performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable
statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More
specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about
50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement
Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test
and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step
forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and
this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a
more informed manner.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly
outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks

with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value
decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose
a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance.

allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical
grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the
necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's
functions theory.

Motivation: 传统的数据影响力评估方法主要关注模型收敛后的静态影响力，忽视了在优化过程中样本影响力的动态变化特性，特别是在深度模型中。现有方法计算负担重，难以频繁进行影响力估计。

Method: 开发了层感知在线估计器，仅需损失对输出的梯度，避免参数级和全网络梯度计算，同时保持排序保真度。

Result: 在LLM预训练、微调和图像分类等任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在显著降低时间和内存成本的同时提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法使动态数据筛选在实践中变得高效且可扩展，为数据中心学习提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to
boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is
to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely
focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data
valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the
dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep
models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation,
we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output
gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while
preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining,
fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with
substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation
efficient and scalable in practice.

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), however, in
real-world industrial scenarios, many time series comprise not only numerical
variables such as temperature and flow, but also numerous discrete state
variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the
week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state
variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them
uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach
prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a
significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are
integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel
STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance
the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the
fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We
design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex
categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)
We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates
low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby
flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.
(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively
detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve
the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

Conclusion: 决策导向框架能够更有效地支持洪水应急响应，通过端到端优化提升决策质量

Abstract: Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response,
yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness
due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood
management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote
sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take
flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these
approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where
to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train
flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but
overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors
may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel
decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ
sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to
optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline
integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable
sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood
reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer
tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the
incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable
gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic
decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained
disaster response tasks.

Motivation: 翼型几何优化需要在尽可能少的设计变量下探索多样化的设计空间，传统方法存在设计变量过多或设计能力有限的问题。

Method: 从UIUC翼型数据库中系统性地选择12个最优基线翼型，通过顺序添加最能提升设计容量的基线，构建设计变形框架。

Result: 用12个基线重建了99%的数据库，平均绝对误差低于0.005；在多目标气动优化中实现快速收敛，获得更大超体积的帕累托前沿，发现了具有更高升阻比的新帕累托最优解。

Conclusion: AirDbM在保持高重建精度的同时显著降低了设计变量数量，在多目标优化和强化学习应用中表现出优越性能，证明了设计变形方法在机器学习驱动设计中的广阔潜力。

Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of
designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces
AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil
optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM
selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database,
which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most
increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 \%
of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the
performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In
multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence
and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the
previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are
discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances.
Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement
learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to
conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential
of DbM in machine learning-driven design.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and
short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to
adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and
reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning
(RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into
the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The
problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances
trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained
on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy
consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios.
Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and
transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of
market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results
indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and
operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV
producers.

Method: 提出信息瓶颈引导的微调(IB-FT)，在代码数据的隐藏表示上应用信息瓶颈惩罚，压缩虚假的记忆化特征，同时保留任务相关信息。

Result: 在两个代码基准测试(OriGen和Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)上的实验表明，IB-FT显著缓解了记忆化障碍，提高了top-1性能，在更严格的多样本度量下获得了更稳定的增益。

Conclusion: IB-FT方法能够有效克服代码生成中的记忆化障碍，相比传统微调方法在性能和稳定性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to code domains via
supervised fine-tuning (FT) has been commonly used for code generation.
However, we identify a previously underappreciated failure mode, the
memorization barrier, where strong memorization of downstream code data in the
base model could trap optimization and prevent the standard FT from effectively
acquiring new, generalizable code knowledge. To overcome this barrier, we
propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which
applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress
spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.
Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)
show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves
top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the
stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if
at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.

Conclusion: PolyConFM为聚合物科学提供了一个通用且强大的工具，通过构象中心的生成预训练统一了聚合物建模和设计。

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin
countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep
learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the
whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global
structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately
limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a
universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream
tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we
introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer
modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining.
Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of
local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM
under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local
conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating
their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer
conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation
dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby
enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that
PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on
diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and
powerful tool.

Abstract: Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for
individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered
considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous
detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these
detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited
control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the
heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot
control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.
Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts
by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby
evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving
social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social
accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then
employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the
attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a
hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to
accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot
detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the
performance of GNN-based detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化方法处理静态输入，无法有效压缩时空序列。受大脑网格细胞启发，需要开发能同时压缩空间和时间信息的统一世界模型。

Method: 使用动作条件码本，码字来自连续吸引子神经网络，根据动作动态选择。通过网格状模式在吸引子动力学中进行时空压缩。

Result: 实验表明GCQ在多种任务中能有效进行紧凑编码，支持长时程预测、目标导向规划和逆向建模，下游性能表现优异。

Conclusion: GCQ既为高效序列建模提供了计算工具，也为神经系统中网格状代码形成提供了理论视角。

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for
compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using
grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector
quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs
spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where
codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically
selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time,
serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports
long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact
encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool
for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation
of grid-like codes in neural systems.

TL;DR: AMS-Quant是一种创新的浮点量化方法，通过尾数位共享和自适应搜索技术，首次将量化位宽扩展到非整数位宽，显著加速大语言模型推理速度，同时保持精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的巨大参数量带来了存储和推理效率瓶颈，浮点量化虽然能通过减少内存占用和数据移动来加速推理，但传统方法局限于整数位宽，无法达到最优量化点。

Method: 提出两种新技术：(1) 尾数位共享：将k个量化权重分组共享最低有效尾数位，逼近最小量化位宽；(2) 自适应搜索：采用离线优化策略最小化共享带来的精度损失。同时实现为高效CUDA线性核，将内存节省转化为实际延迟减少。

Result: 实验表明AMS-Quant可将模型量化为FP-5.33-e2m3和FP4.25-e2m2，相比FP16推理显著加速解码速度（2.8倍和3.2倍），精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: AMS-Quant通过非整数位宽量化成功突破了传统量化方法的限制，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了推理效率，为大语言模型的部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring
storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly
floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM
inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference
process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization
exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant,
to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two
novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing,
which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant
mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization
bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which
employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation
introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA
Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency
reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale
datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3
and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16
inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI
understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments
remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual
annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We
introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically
explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical
data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS -
an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many
of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability.
GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into
hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve
comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla
crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of
27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each
annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility
metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning
LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on
downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro
benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source
library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along
with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold
benchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and
improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has
intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting
models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can
effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and
dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models
such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including
STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic
datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional
structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular
effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by
periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored
various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied
on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced
manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for
different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat
enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy
reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse
and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often
lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has
generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of
applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive
performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored,
despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical
applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties
of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We
perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e.,
over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and
calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time
series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline
models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in
contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for
real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER
penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust
distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to
maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however,
struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting
their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph
neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both
electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low
observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the
public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of
buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower
RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as
little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs
to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for
distribution systems.

Conclusion: 残差学习是连接线性近似和AC可行OPF的实用可扩展桥梁，可实现近实时的运行决策。

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major
computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we
propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC
OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections
required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a
topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC
feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC
power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-,
118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in
feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC
OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales
efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning
is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and
AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research
frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel
model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate
statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter
decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in
PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods
remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede
practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with
Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that
strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an
integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is
seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant
communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive
evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID
conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse
aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for
communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence
systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude
acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still
suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains
where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we
introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point
clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global
dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph
attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise
attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale
inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on
four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios
with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and
demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results
highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and
establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on
irregular domains.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the
underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled
early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of
the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed
distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we
demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed
structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides
guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two
consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed
dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong
alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring
and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent
subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some
heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1
and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

Result: 综合实验验证了BPL在事实和反事实测试中的有效性

Conclusion: BPL框架通过双重蒸馏策略成功解决了推荐系统偏差问题，在两个测试环境中都实现了高性能

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to
incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been
extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called
counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,
significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test
environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test
environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual
test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test
focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only
one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive
Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences
with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed
to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.
Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased
model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected
feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through
self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its
knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce
more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,
thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and
counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:

TL;DR: CONEC-LoRA提出了一种新的领域增量学习方法，通过任务共享和任务特定的LoRA整合、随机分类器和辅助网络来解决灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法创建任务特定的LoRA，忽略了跨任务的共享知识，且推理时选择不准确会导致精度显著下降。现有分类器泛化能力不足。

Method: 1. 整合任务共享和任务特定LoRA；2. 使用随机分类器增强分类正确率；3. 部署辅助网络预测任务特定LoRA；4. 采用不同深度网络结构利用中间表示；5. 集成球生成器损失和转换模块解决合成样本偏差。

Result: 在4个流行基准问题上，CONEC-LoRA比现有方法性能提升超过5%。

Conclusion: CONEC-LoRA通过知识整合和随机分类器设计，在领域增量学习任务中取得了显著优势。

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that
aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic
forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared
knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during
inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely
on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization
powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank
adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed
from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and
task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing
approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose
parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of
correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed
to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the
concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is
connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate
representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and
transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our
rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in
4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有密码重用检测方法在可用性和部署方面的限制，现有方法通常通过限制密码创建或网站访问来损害可用性，且依赖复杂的账户共享机制阻碍实际部署。

Method: 引入密码重用关系概念，将其表示为网站图中的边，使用图神经网络进行链接预测任务评估网站间密码重用风险。采用联邦学习方法保护用户隐私，无需跨管理员共享敏感信息。

Result: 在包含22,378个网站的3.6亿个泄露账户的真实数据集上，PassREfinder-FL在联邦学习设置下达到0.9153的F1分数。联邦学习图神经网络相比其他最先进模型性能提升4-11%。

Conclusion: PassREfinder-FL能够有效预测网站间的密码重用风险，生成的预测结果可作为可操作的风险评分量化密码重用可能性，同时通过联邦学习保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who
frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has
attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login
attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password
creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing
mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we
propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing
risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --
defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and
represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),
we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between
sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by
incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as
nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a
federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user
sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset
of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that
PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further
validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over
other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we
demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse
likelihood as actionable risk scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法在物理神经网络中难以实现，平衡传播(EP)作为一种替代方案具有相当的效率和原位训练潜力，但需要扩展到更广泛的物理系统中。

Method: 扩展EP学习到离散和连续复值波系统，在弱耗散状态下有效，用可训练的局部势能替代节点间连接，在激子极化激元凝聚体中测试。

Result: 在标准基准测试中（包括逻辑任务和手写数字识别）表现出稳定收敛，为物理系统中的原位学习提供了实用途径。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统控制仅限于局部参数的物理系统中的原位学习建立了实用路线，展示了在多种物理环境中应用EP学习的可行性。

Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial
intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural
networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable
efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to
both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to
previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative
regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even
without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be
replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative
exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical
task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence,
establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which
system control is restricted to local parameters.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research
hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding.
Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion
on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in
real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and
device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability.
  To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework
(FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task.
  Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization
module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous,
modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate
constraint paradigms for representation learning.
  Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that
fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge
transfer.
  Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a
significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要持续适应机制但避免完全重训练，序列更新会导致灾难性遗忘，新编辑会降低先前获得的知识。

Method: 使用LoRA进行参数高效微调，通过三种指标（精确匹配下降、比特增加、KL散度）评估候选编辑的稳定性，超过阈值时通过裁剪过程重新缩放LoRA更新或拒绝编辑。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，门控有效缓解遗忘同时保持适应性，基于EM的门控在短持续学习序列中实现最高累积性能。

Conclusion: 不同门控策略可实现相当的分布偏移但产生不同的准确性结果，突显了门控设计在持续适应中的重要性，为持续模型编辑提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual
adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.
This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that
constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine
tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate
edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i)
Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase,
reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying
distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is
exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected.
Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates
forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest
cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show
that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift
(measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes,
highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This
approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs
to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code:

Motivation: 多示例上下文学习虽然能提升任务性能，但token数量增加导致内存和计算成本急剧上升，需要高效的压缩方法来平衡性能与效率。

Method: 提出MemCom层间压缩方法，使用更强参数量的压缩器模型，在transformer的每一层进行细粒度压缩，生成软token摘要。

Result: 在多种模型大小、架构和压缩比下，MemCom均优于基线方法，在高压缩比下性能下降小于10%，而基线方法下降超过20-30%。

Conclusion: MemCom通过层间压缩实现了有效的多示例提示压缩，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升了上下文学习的效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different
tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples /
demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of
examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs
higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to
improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing
the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to
generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing
prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and
simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve
effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more
trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot
representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression
by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these
insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically
evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different
model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence
lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms
strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks
with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at
higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy
with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

Motivation: 探索是否能在顺序决策任务中通过自适应控制人类代理水平来实现人机互补，就像在分类任务中已经证明的那样。

Method: 使用预训练的AI代理将人类可采取的行动限制在一个子集内，然后让人类从这个行动集中选择行动，并引入利用行动集平滑特性的bandit算法来优化人类代理水平。

Result: 在1600名参与者的大规模人类研究中，使用该系统的参与者在野火缓解游戏中的表现比单独行动提升30%，比AI代理提升2%以上，尽管AI代理本身比无支持的参与者表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过限制行动选择范围的自适应决策支持系统能够有效实现人机互补，在顺序决策任务中显著提升整体性能。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design
decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when
to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve
complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate
predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key
principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the
level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve
complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer
this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a
pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a
subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along
the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness
properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize
the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct
a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a
wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported
by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI
agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely
outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the
data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source

Abstract: World Models have vastly permeated the field of Reinforcement Learning. Their
ability to model the transition dynamics of an environment have greatly
improved sample efficiency in online RL. Among them, the most notorious example
is Dreamer, a model that learns to act in a diverse set of image-based
environments. In this paper, we leverage similarity search and stochastic
representations to approximate a world model without a training procedure. We
establish a comparison with PlaNet, a well-established world model of the
Dreamer family. We evaluate the models on the quality of latent reconstruction
and on the perceived similarity of the reconstructed image, on both next-step
and long horizon dynamics prediction. The results of our study demonstrate that
a search-based world model is comparable to a training based one in both cases.
Notably, our model show stronger performance in long-horizon prediction with
respect to the baseline on a range of visually different environments.

Result: 建立了Q函数估计的收敛速率，样本复杂度为O(1/ε²)，与off-policy Q-learning匹配但探索参数依赖更差；同时推导了学习策略下Q函数的收敛速率。

Conclusion: on-policy Q-learning具有较弱的探索能力但享受利用优势，其策略会收敛到最优策略。所开发的分析工具可推广到其他具有时变学习策略的强化学习算法。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first finite-time analysis of the Q-learning
algorithm under time-varying learning policies (i.e., on-policy sampling) with
minimal assumptions -- specifically, assuming only the existence of a policy
that induces an irreducible Markov chain over the state space. We establish a
last-iterate convergence rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for achieving
$\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty] \le \epsilon$, matching that of off-policy
Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We
also derive an explicit rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q^{\pi_k} - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
where $\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal
that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy
counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an
optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our
theory.
  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce
rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on
exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these
challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to
decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into
a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms
under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson
equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning
policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general
reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies
-- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games
algorithms -- and are of independent interest.

Conclusion: NAMEx在大规模系统（如Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE）中表现出色，在零样本和微调设置下都有效，证明了其可扩展性。

Abstract: Existing expert merging strategies for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE)
typically rely on input-dependent or input-independent averaging of expert
parameters, but often lack a principled weighting mechanism. In this work, we
reinterpret expert merging through the lens of game theory, revealing
cooperative and competitive dynamics among experts. Based on this perspective,
we introduce Nash Merging of Experts (NAMEx), a novel framework that
incorporates Nash Bargaining into the merging process, enabling more balanced
and efficient collaboration among experts. Additionally, we incorporate complex
momentum into NAMEx to accelerate expert propagation with theoretical
guarantees for convergence. Extensive experiments across language modelling,
text classification, image classification, and zero-shot robustness under data
corruption show that NAMEx consistently outperforms competing methods while
integrating seamlessly with popular MoE architectures. Finally, we demonstrate
NAMEx's scalability by applying it to large-scale systems, including
Qwen1.5-MoE (14B) and DeepSeek-MoE (16B), where it proves effective in both
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

Motivation: 传统零阶优化方法关注扰动参数下的期望目标（平均损失），而锐度感知最小化关注邻域内的最大损失以获得更平坦的最小值。本文旨在明确连接这两种方法。

Method: 使用指数倾斜目标作为平滑过渡机制，开发新的零阶算法来求解参数化的软SAM目标，并精确刻画倾斜SAM框架的锐度概念。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可作为SAM变体的无梯度和内存高效替代方案，在多个任务上展现出优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent
challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works
have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the
prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear
what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever
modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still
competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In
this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential
basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made
at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based
predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state
representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular
observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)
observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state
using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous
time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on
next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can
indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers
compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal

TL;DR: 本文对三种代表性生成模型（AtomGPT、CDVAE、FlowMM）在超导材料数据集上进行了系统基准测试，评估其重构晶体结构的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成模型在材料发现中应用日益广泛，但缺乏对其性能的严格比较评估。本研究旨在填补这一空白，系统比较不同架构在材料数据集上的表现。

Method: 使用三种代表性生成模型（基于transformer的AtomGPT、晶体扩散变分自编码器CDVAE、黎曼流匹配模型FlowMM），在两个公开超导数据集（JARVIS Supercon 3D和Alexandria DS A/B）上进行训练和评估。

Result: 通过KL散度和平均绝对误差评估，CDVAE表现最佳，其次是AtomGPT，FlowMM表现相对较差。

Conclusion: CDVAE在晶体结构重构任务中表现最优，为材料生成模型的选择提供了实证依据。所有基准测试代码和模型配置将公开提供。

Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and
identification of new materials, enabling the rapid proposal of candidate
crystal structures that satisfy target properties. Despite the increasing
adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their
performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a
systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a
transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE),
and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to
reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available
superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria
database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as
the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed
KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and
then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/atombench_inverse.

*Archie Chaudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过层间因果修补分析语言模型对齐机制，发现对齐是空间局部化的：中间层激活编码了决定奖励一致行为的独特子空间，而早期和晚期层基本不受影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）已成为语言模型偏好微调的流行方法，但其内部对齐机制仍然不透明，需要系统分析。

Method: 在基础模型和调优模型之间应用层间因果修补，分析人类偏好对中的对齐机制，并使用LASSO回归识别关键层。

Result: 对齐是空间局部化的，中间层激活编码了决定奖励一致行为的独特子空间，只有少数层具有非零系数连接激活距离与奖励增益。

Conclusion: 基于人类偏好的语言模型对齐是一个方向性的低秩过程，而非扩散的参数化过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过嵌入群等变卷积（旋转和尺度等变层）到标准CNN中来增强对抗鲁棒性的架构方法，无需对抗训练即可提升模型对对抗攻击的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练作为主要防御策略存在计算成本高和可能降低干净数据准确性的问题，因此需要探索更高效的架构方法来增强对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种对称感知架构：并行设计（独立处理标准和等变特征后融合）和级联设计（顺序应用等变操作），嵌入旋转和尺度等变卷积层到CNN中。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和CIFAR-10C数据集上，模型在FGSM和PGD攻击下持续提升对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，无需对抗训练。

Conclusion: 对称强制架构作为数据增强防御的高效原则性替代方案具有巨大潜力，能够降低假设空间复杂度、正则化梯度并在CLEVER框架下获得更紧的认证鲁棒性边界。

Abstract: Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks
by exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While
adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs
significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this
work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by
embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and
scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured
transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and
greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two
symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and
equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that
applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that
such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield
tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme
Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently
improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial
training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing
architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data
augmentation-based defenses.

Motivation: 当前强化学习研究过度强调智能体性能表现，导致基准测试过拟合、技术难以迁移，且忽视了理解学习动态的基础研究。

Method: 以Arcade Learning Environment为例，展示如何有效利用现有基准来发展对强化学习的理解，并促进技术在实际问题中的部署。

Result: 论证了性能导向研究的局限性，提出了重新聚焦于科学理解和基准形式化的必要性。

Conclusion: 强化学习研究应从单纯展示能力转向深入理解学习动态，并更精确地定义基准与数学形式化之间的映射关系。

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement
learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at
performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the
community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often
at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.
Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic
benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult
to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly
diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at
improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:
(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent
capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of
reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our
benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a
benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be
effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the
deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

*Daniel Donnelly,Angelo Ferrando,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运行时监控语言（RML）的新型语言奖励机，能够表达非正则、非马尔可夫任务的奖励函数，解决了传统奖励机表达能力受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中奖励函数通常被视为黑盒映射，缺乏解释性。传统奖励机虽然能表示结构化奖励函数，但其表达能力受限于正则语言，无法处理计数或参数化条件等复杂行为。

Method: 基于运行时监控语言（RML）构建新型语言奖励机，利用RML的内置内存机制来指定非正则、非马尔可夫任务的奖励函数。

Result: 实验证明了该方法在表达能力上的优势，在事件处理和任务规范方面比现有基于奖励机的方法更加灵活。

Conclusion: 基于RML的语言奖励机扩展了奖励函数的表达能力，能够处理更复杂的非正则、非马尔可夫任务，为强化学习提供了更好的可解释性和灵活性。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification,
whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly
harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as
black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in
many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are
given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address
this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling
the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their
expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to
capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In
this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel
class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of
RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian
tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments,
highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task
specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在处理结构化问题时忽略了问题的内在结构，而关系强化学习虽然能处理结构化问题但假设过强。需要一种能同时处理结构化和非结构化数据的方法。

Method: 结合关系强化学习与物体中心表示，通过显式建模策略不确定性来主动查询人类专家获取指导。

Result: 实证评估表明所提方法具有有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效处理结构化和非结构化数据，并通过主动学习机制提升学习效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has experienced a second wind in the past decade.
While incredibly successful in images and videos, these systems still operate
within the realm of propositional tasks ignoring the inherent structure that
exists in the problem. Consequently, relational extensions (RRL) have been
developed for such structured problems that allow for effective generalization
to arbitrary number of objects. However, they inherently make strong
assumptions about the problem structure. We introduce a novel framework that
combines RRL with object-centric representation to handle both structured and
unstructured data. We enhance learning by allowing the system to actively query
the human expert for guidance by explicitly modeling the uncertainty over the
policy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对非平稳多臂赌博机问题的探索-承诺算法，该问题中奖励取决于动作和服从未知线性动态的潜在状态，状态动态也受动作影响。算法通过随机探索估计线性动态的马尔可夫参数，然后设计优化动作序列，实现了O~(T^{2/3})的遗憾上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非平稳多臂赌博机问题，其中奖励同时依赖于动作和服从未知线性动态的潜在状态，且状态动态也受动作影响，这导致了短期奖励与长期奖励之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出探索-承诺算法：在探索阶段使用随机Rademacher动作估计线性动态的马尔可夫参数；在承诺阶段利用估计参数设计优化动作序列以最大化长期奖励。

Result: 算法实现了O~(T^{2/3})的遗憾上界，解决了从时间相关奖励中学习和设计具有最优长期奖励的动作序列两个关键挑战。

Conclusion: 通过系统识别和不定二次优化问题的等价性分析，提供了有效的遗憾上界保证，并提出使用半定松弛和Goemans-Williamson舍入作为实用方法。

Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions
and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially,
the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between
short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm
for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher
actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics,
which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the
algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence
for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges:
learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences
with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing
near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using
bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence
with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard
problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our
regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with
Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

TL;DR: 本文对标签噪声检测方法进行了系统性基准测试，通过将方法分解为三个核心组件（标签一致性函数、聚合方法和信息收集方式），发现使用对数边际作为标签一致性函数、平均概率聚合和样本内信息收集的组合在多数场景下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集中普遍存在标签噪声问题，影响模型训练和验证。虽然已有多种噪声标签检测技术，但缺乏对最优方法的明确共识，需要系统性比较不同方法的性能。

Method: 将噪声检测方法分解为三个基本组件：标签一致性函数、聚合方法和信息收集方式（样本内vs样本外）。提出统一基准任务，检测与数据集噪声率相等的训练样本比例，并引入新的评估指标。

Result: 在视觉和表格数据集上的评估表明，使用对数边际作为标签一致性函数、平均概率聚合和样本内信息收集的组合在合成和真实噪声条件下均取得最佳结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计新的检测方法和为特定应用选择技术提供了实用指导，样本内信息收集结合平均概率聚合和对数边际标签一致性函数是最有效的组合策略。

Abstract: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, affecting both model
training and validation. Clean data are essential for achieving strong
performance and ensuring reliable evaluation. While various techniques have
been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal
approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by
decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function,
aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs
out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection
methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly
compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of
training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel
metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation
spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise
conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average
probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement
function achieves the best results across most scenarios. Our findings provide
practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques
for specific applications.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts.
This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the
progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on
policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies,
incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression
status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and
ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on
predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other
approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance
with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods
from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording
and metadata including political party and country representation. These
findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy

Abstract: Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight compression to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random
features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network
compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.

Conclusion: WEBSERV为RL Web代理训练提供了高效可扩展的环境，显著提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained
increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples
realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side
state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more
of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy
context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI
or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers
effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that
includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context
and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching
and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We
evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving
state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by
~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling
200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

Conclusion: 连续深度模型为生物分子建模提供了轻量级、可解释的替代方案，为高效自适应蛋白质结构预测框架开辟了新方向

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in
discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored
disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge
disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage
hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that
are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge
disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel
criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our
proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed
criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in
genetic pathways (hyperedges).

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by
large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and
real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value
Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight
matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition
introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the
SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction
in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach
by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a
highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely
solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy
improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time
deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at

bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class
imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active
molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify
structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce
ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through
three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data
conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a
graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore
the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling
algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with
underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used
to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module
with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that
improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of
molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general
performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive
computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug
against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple
evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this
work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging
generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2-DiGCL是一种针对有向图的对比学习框架，通过复数域和实数域的双重视角来捕捉方向性信息，在节点分类和链接预测任务上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图对比学习方法主要关注无向图，忽略了现实世界网络（如社交网络和推荐系统）中至关重要的方向性信息。

Method: 从复数域视角，在磁拉普拉斯矩阵中引入个性化扰动来调节边相位和方向语义；从实数域视角，采用基于路径的子图增强策略来捕捉细粒度的局部不对称性和拓扑依赖。

Result: 在7个真实世界有向图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在节点分类和链接预测任务上分别提升了4.41%和4.34%的性能。

Conclusion: 通过联合利用复数域和实数域两个互补的空间视角，S2-DiGCL能够构建高质量的正负样本，实现更通用和鲁棒的有向图对比学习。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled
information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected
graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental
and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and
recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that
emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for
directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain
perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic
Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From
the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation
strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological
dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views,
S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more
general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7
real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach,
achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and
4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

<details>

Motivation: 重新思考记忆与泛化的关系，研究记忆如何通过组合长尾特征来帮助泛化，特别是在处理训练数据中未出现的长尾特征组合时。

Method: 在线性设置中进行理论分析，证明记忆与组合的协同作用；在神经网络架构上进行实验验证，研究不同架构的组合能力。

Result: 理论分析表明记忆与组合能帮助模型对未见过的长尾特征组合做出正确预测；实验证实该理论洞察适用于非线性设置，且模型组合能力依赖于其架构。

Conclusion: 记忆与组合能力之间存在协同作用，这种协同可以帮助模型泛化到未见过的长尾特征组合，且模型架构影响其组合能力。

Abstract: Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between
memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt
generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing
long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between
memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction
on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a
linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make
correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of
long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the
training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show
that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further
observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提取细粒度时序模式、多模态信息融合和适应动态多尺度特征方面存在不足，限制了预测精度。

Method: 1) 多模态特征提取层：针对时序、视觉和文本模态优化特征编码器；2) 多模态特征融合层：构建异质图建模模态内时序依赖和跨模态对齐关系；3) 多尺度预测层：动态加权融合短、中、长期预测器输出。

Result: 实验表明MGTS-Net在轻量高效的前提下表现出色，相比现有最优基线模型取得更优性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法验证了其优越性，有效解决了多模态时间序列预测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating
multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of
such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of
fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal
information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To
address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced
Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core
components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes
feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and
textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a
Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph
to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment
relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a
Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by
dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and
long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits
excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with
other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior
performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.

Motivation: 将数据分布的先验信息直接整合到transformer架构中，以改善传统基于神经ODE方法的优化问题凸性，并促进生成样本的稀疏性。

Method: 基于正则化Wasserstein近端算子设计稀疏transformer架构，该算子具有闭式解且可表示为特殊的transformer结构。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，在生成建模和贝叶斯逆问题应用中，稀疏transformer比传统神经ODE方法具有更高精度和更快收敛速度。

Conclusion: 所提出的稀疏transformer架构在准确性和收敛速度方面优于传统方法，为结合先验信息与transformer结构提供了有效框架。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a sparse transformer architecture that incorporates
prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the
transformer structure of the neural network. The design of the model is
motivated by a special optimal transport problem, namely the regularized
Wasserstein proximal operator, which admits a closed-form solution and turns
out to be a special representation of transformer architectures. Compared with
classical flow-based models, the proposed approach improves the convexity
properties of the optimization problem and promotes sparsity in the generated
samples. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including
applications in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems, we
demonstrate that the sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster
convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods.

Motivation: 传统稀疏专家混合模型(SMoE)虽然能解耦模型参数量和计算成本，但在数据分布变化时缺乏鲁棒性，容易受到数据污染的影响。

Method: 引入专家间的社交图来建模专家交互，增强令牌路由过程，构建轻量级、模块化的SymphonySMoE架构，可无缝集成到现有SMoE模型中。

Conclusion: SymphonySMoE通过图结构增强了SMoE的鲁棒性，同时保持了可扩展性和与现有模型的兼容性，为大规模深度学习系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a promising solution to
achieving unparalleled scalability in deep learning by decoupling model
parameter count from computational cost. By activating only a small subset of
parameters per sample, SMoE enables significant growth in model capacity while
maintaining efficiency. However, SMoE struggles to adapt to distributional
shifts, leading to reduced robustness under data contamination. In this work,
we introduce SymphonySMoE, a novel family of SMoE that introduces a social
graph to model interactions among experts. This graph-based structure enhances
the token routing process, addressing the robustness challenges that are
inherent in conventional SMoE designs. SymphonySMoE is lightweight, modular,
and integrates seamlessly with existing SMoE-based models such as the XMoE and
the Generalist Language Model. We provide both theoretical analysis and
empirical evidence demonstrating SymphonySMoE's advantages over baseline SMoE.
Extensive experiments on language modeling and visual instruction tuning
validate our method's effectiveness. We further highlight the scalability of
SymphonySMoE to models with 4.2 and 7.4 billion parameters, showcasing its
applicability in fine-tuning tasks for large-scale systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于相似性得分的路由机制难以有效捕捉输入底层结构，导致专家专业化与计算平衡之间的权衡，限制了可扩展性和性能。

Method: 使用概率混合模型建模路由概率，使专家形成清晰的专业化边界，同时实现均衡利用。路由机制独立于任务特定目标进行训练。

Conclusion: 提出的Input Domain Aware MoE框架通过更好的输入空间划分，解决了稀疏专家混合路由中的关键挑战，实现了专家专业化与计算效率的更好平衡。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling
large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining
computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts.
However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring,
struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation
leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation,
hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE,
a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to
better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a
mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear
specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike
conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of
task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert
assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task
performance and improved expert utilization balance.

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了传粉昆虫决策中学习策略和记忆相互作用的新机制，改进了农业生态系统中昆虫行为的模拟，支持生态治理。

Abstract: We introduce a sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation
learning designed to model heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators.
Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture
and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some
exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by
environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting:
when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality,
these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot
faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited
interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses
these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss
while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral
data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze
underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a
mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under
varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80
tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark
facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance
by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings
shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping
pollinator decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统投影到潜在结构(PLS)方法难以建模高维异构数据中的复杂非线性关系，特别是在具有高维相关结构的多元系统中。同时跨多尺度的交互以及静态特征权重限制了模型对上下文变化的适应性。

Method: 引入自适应核注意力机制，分别处理不同的特征组然后进行整合，既能捕捉局部模式又能保持全局关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，在多个数据集上相比最先进方法在性能指标上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过新颖的架构创新有效解决了高维异构数据建模中的挑战，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose
significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While
Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles
to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems
with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further
compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local
processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static
feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores
sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural
innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention
mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration,
enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.
Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics,
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: OracleAD是一个简单可解释的无监督多变量时间序列异常检测框架，通过因果嵌入建模时间动态，利用自注意力机制捕捉空间关系，并基于预测误差和稳定潜在结构偏差进行双重评分来识别异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多变量时间序列异常稀少且通常无标签，现有方法依赖复杂架构，只能检测异常片段的一部分并夸大性能表现。

Method: 将每个变量的过去序列编码为因果嵌入来联合预测当前时间点和重建输入窗口，使用自注意力机制将嵌入投影到共享潜在空间，并将投影嵌入对齐到代表正常状态关系的稳定潜在结构(SLS)。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集和评估协议上实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: OracleAD通过SLS直接定位嵌入级别的根本原因变量，同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled.
Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures
tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and
overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and
interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly
detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal
embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input
window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a
self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture
spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are
modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The
projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS)
representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual
scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS,
enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across
individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from
embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD
directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and
evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于连通性因子(CF)的eDCF方法，用于在多个尺度下稳健估计高维数据的本征维度，在噪声环境下表现优异，并能检测分形几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据集通常包含具有复杂依赖关系的高维特征，但本征维度估计受尺度影响：精细尺度下噪声会膨胀估计值，而粗尺度下估计值会稳定在较低的尺度不变值。需要一种能在不同尺度下稳健估计本征维度的方法。

Method: 基于连通性因子(CF)开发了eDCF方法，这是一种局部连通性度量方法，具有可扩展性和并行化特性。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，eDCF与领先估计器表现相当，MAE值相近。在精确本征维度匹配率方面表现更优：达到25.0%，而MLE为16.7%，TWO-NN为12.5%，在中高噪声水平和大数据集下表现尤其突出。还能准确检测决策边界中的分形几何结构。

Conclusion: eDCF方法能够稳健地估计本征维度，在噪声环境下表现优异，适用于分析现实世界的结构化数据。

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex
dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction
methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure
of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its
dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at
coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This
paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF,
which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric,
to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method
consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean
absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our
approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up
to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling
under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our
method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision
boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.

Motivation: 现有评估LLM因果发现能力的方法存在缺陷，许多基准测试数据可能已包含在预训练语料中，导致结果被高估。需要开发更可靠的评估协议来验证LLM的真实推理能力。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 基于训练截止后发布的最新科学研究构建评估基准，防止数据泄露；2) 设计混合方法，将LLM预测作为经典PC算法的先验知识。

Result: 在传统基准测试中LLM表现接近完美，但在作者构建的真实科学图谱上表现较差。将LLM预测作为PC算法先验能显著提高准确性，优于纯LLM方法和纯统计方法。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区采用基于科学研究的防泄露基准，并投资开发适合真实世界探究的混合因果发现方法，以充分发挥LLM在因果分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal
discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks
likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that
LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical
statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly
reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization
concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue
that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)
developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to
guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine
LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage
evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We
outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent
publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and
preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.
Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,
they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for
statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as
priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both
LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt
science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal
discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on
life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience
their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health
and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog,
complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions
concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the
potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a
high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a
government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature
learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were
extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily
interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models
(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular
data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful
counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It
was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the
biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also
conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection
techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary
determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that
health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study
demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly
contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human

working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

TL;DR: 提出了NeurIPT，一种基于预训练Transformer的脑电图基础模型，通过捕捉EEG信号的时空特征来解决跨被试、跨任务和跨条件的变异性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着EEG数据量的增长，需要建立能够扩展和泛化神经解码的基础模型，但EEG数据存在显著的被试间、任务间和条件间变异性，以及不同的电极配置，这给基础模型的应用带来了挑战。

Method: 1) 时间上：引入基于信号幅度的掩码预训练(AAMP)和渐进专家混合架构(PMoE)；2) 空间上：利用电极3D物理坐标实现跨设置嵌入迁移，并在微调时开发脑叶内外池化(IILP)。

Result: 在八个下游BCI数据集上的评估显示，NeurIPT通过微调持续实现了最先进的性能，证明了其广泛的适用性和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了EEG基础模型的发展，为可扩展和可泛化的神经信息处理系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical
diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and
variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation
models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early
potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial
inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse
electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open
challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse
EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both
homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG
signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP),
masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust
representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation.
Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive
Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks
are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the
diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages
the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of
embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling
(IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features.
Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning,
demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes
forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and
generalizable neural information processing systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANPO框架通过分离语言反馈和数值奖励的角色来解决LLM强化学习中的样本效率问题，语言指导探索，数值奖励驱动优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM强化学习依赖标量奖励，丢弃了rollouts中的宝贵文本推理信息，迫使模型每次重新探索，降低了样本效率。

Method: LANPO构建动态经验池，引入奖励无关反思进行样本内自我修正，以及相关抽象从样本间经验中提取可泛化教训。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，7B和14B模型使用LANPO显著优于使用GRPO训练的强基线模型。

Conclusion: LANPO为将历史经验整合到LLM强化学习循环中提供了稳健方法，创造了更有效和数据高效的学习智能体。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar
rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the
rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and
hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language
feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL
training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information
leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to
behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we
propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a
framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides
exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic
experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure
feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample
self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable
lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong
baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method
for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more
effective and data-efficient learning agents.

Motivation: 现有无模板方法难以捕捉化学反应中的结构不变性，导致搜索空间过大和预测精度降低。

Method: 使用C-SMILES表示法分解SMILES，结合复制增强机制动态决定生成新标记或保留未变分子片段，并集成SMILES对齐指导增强注意力一致性。

Result: 在USPTO-50K和USPTO-FULL数据集上分别达到67.2%和50.8%的top-1准确率，生成分子有效性达99.9%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为结构感知分子生成建立了新范式，在计算药物发现中具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is fundamental to drug discovery and chemical
synthesis, requiring the identification of reactants that can produce a target
molecule. Current template-free methods struggle to capture the structural
invariance inherent in chemical reactions, where substantial molecular
scaffolds remain unchanged, leading to unnecessarily large search spaces and
reduced prediction accuracy. We introduce C-SMILES, a novel molecular
representation that decomposes traditional SMILES into element-token pairs with
five special tokens, effectively minimizing editing distance between reactants
and products. Building upon this representation, we incorporate a
copy-augmented mechanism that dynamically determines whether to generate new
tokens or preserve unchanged molecular fragments from the product. Our approach
integrates SMILES alignment guidance to enhance attention consistency with
ground-truth atom mappings, enabling more chemically coherent predictions.
Comprehensive evaluation on USPTO-50K and large-scale USPTO-FULL datasets
demonstrates significant improvements: 67.2% top-1 accuracy on USPTO-50K and
50.8% on USPTO-FULL, with 99.9% validity in generated molecules. This work
establishes a new paradigm for structure-aware molecular generation with direct
applications in computational drug discovery.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the
scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised
methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring
labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the
molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs
a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical
labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this
position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class
examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to
single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.
Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our
work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically
plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and
final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work
also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by
mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing
data scarcity.

Conclusion: 这些发现为对称网络的学习动态及其在建模结构化物理变换时的局限性提供了新见解

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple
layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data.
Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on
difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter
symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their
hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and
network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when
learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the
central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries
and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition
between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or
overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this
poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by
recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an
established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically
validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the
internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These
findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and
their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

Conclusion: 该模型为超复数或非交换代数结构下的神经网络设计提供了实用的实现框架和通用数学方法，在机器人控制等应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing
rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning
Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure
inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a
continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the
quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points
with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic
projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically
projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic
structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence
and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous
mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high
accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated
target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit
well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for
applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms,
where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these
application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation
framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks
under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时增强（如RAG或工具使用）中模型参数知识与外部检索信息的关系，通过将多步推理建模为知识图上的连通性问题，揭示了参数知识密度与增强效率之间的相变现象。


<details>

Motivation: 理解测试时增强中模型参数知识与外部检索信息之间的理论关系，特别是确定在少量增强步骤下回答查询所需的预训练知识量。

Method: 将多步推理建模为知识图上的s-t连通性问题，将模型的预训练参数知识表示为部分、可能有噪声的子图，将增强视为查询真实边来扩展模型知识。

Result: 发现了一个相变现象：当参数知识图断开成小分量时，通过增强找到路径效率低下，需要Ω(√n)次查询；一旦正确知识密度超过阈值形成巨分量，就能以期望常数次查询找到路径。

Conclusion: 参数知识图的连通性对测试时增强效率至关重要，存在一个临界密度阈值，超过该阈值后增强效率显著提升。

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool
use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge
and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how
much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number
of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address
this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity
problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric
knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as
querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we
characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the
model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key
result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices
is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is
inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once
the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant
component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

*Jiatong Yu,Yinghui He,Anirudh Goyal,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 多阶段训练中的机器遗忘存在根本障碍，局部遗忘方法无法普遍实现重训练等价性，因为遗忘结果依赖于训练阶段的顺序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代训练流程通常涉及多阶段训练（如LLM微调对齐、推理能力等），但机器遗忘的Retrain Equivalence目标最初是为i.i.d.数据批次训练制定的，需要研究多阶段训练对遗忘的影响。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析多阶段训练中的机器遗忘问题，在Llama和Qwen模型（1B到14B）上使用梯度上升、NPO和SimNPO等局部遗忘算法进行实证研究。

Result: 不同训练阶段顺序的模型在遗忘过程中行为出现分歧，GSM8K准确率下降差异超过20%，某些学习路径产生遗忘缓慢的模型，概率质量分布也呈现路径依赖性。

Conclusion: 对于多阶段训练的模型，Retrain Equivalence是局部遗忘算法的不适定目标，需要重新思考机器遗忘的定义和期望目标。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to selectively remove the "influence" of specific
training data on a model's outputs. The ideal goal is Retrain
Equivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the
retained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data
batches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each
stage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM
fine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory
and experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a
fundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the
outcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the
forget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is
influenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it
impossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain
Equivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM
post-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,
NPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different
orderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning,
with the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20%
across paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce
models that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass
gets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent.
These results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target
for local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in
stages. In situations where access to models' training histories is hard, the
current work calls for rethinking the definition and desiderata of machine
unlearning.

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

Motivation: Mamba架构在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域表现出色，经常超越基于Transformer的模型，因此希望将其应用于蛋白质-蛋白质对接评分任务以提升性能。

Method: 将PIsToN中的Vision Transformer骨干网络替换为Vision Mamba架构，利用Mamba高效的长序列建模能力处理图像块序列。

Conclusion: 使用Vision Mamba架构显著提升了模型捕捉蛋白质-蛋白质界面特征中全局和局部模式的能力，从而提高了评分函数的准确性。

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data
is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote
sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations
is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise
of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active
target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned
priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from
data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,
these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct
queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong
prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such
as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these
methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with
uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex
real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws
inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies,
our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into
decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in
prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate
sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.
Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains,
including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that
our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time
series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two
tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term
tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We
compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against
strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for
classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped
bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the
Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers
forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in
longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain
competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers
deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

Abstract: The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.

TL;DR: CLIP是一种面向安全联邦学习的客户端不变神经元剪枝技术，结合网络感知剪枝，解决异构设备中计算和网络瓶颈问题，在最小精度损失下加速训练13%-34%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全联邦学习在异构设备部署时，由于计算或网络能力受限的慢速客户端（stragglers）导致性能瓶颈，拖慢所有参与客户端的训练速度。

Method: 提出CLIP技术，结合客户端不变神经元剪枝和网络感知剪枝，针对慢速客户端的计算和网络瓶颈进行优化。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR10、Shakespeare、FEMNIST）上实现安全联邦学习训练加速13%-34%，精度影响在提升1.3%到降低2.6%之间。

Conclusion: CLIP是首个针对安全聚合深度神经网络中的慢速客户端缓解技术，能有效解决异构设备环境下的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed
model training. However, deploying such frameworks across heterogeneous devices
results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited
computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating
clients. This paper introduces the first straggler mitigation technique for
secure aggregation with deep neural networks. We propose CLIP, a client-side
invariant neuron pruning technique coupled with network-aware pruning, that
addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training
with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13%
to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an
accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.

*Iman Deznabi,Peeyush Kumar,Madalina Fiterau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种分辨率感知的检索增强预测模型，通过利用空间相关性和时间频率特征来提高零样本预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本预测旨在预测没有直接历史数据的未见条件下的结果，这对传统预测方法构成了重大挑战。

Method: 将信号分解为不同频率分量，采用分辨率感知检索：低频分量依赖更广泛的空间上下文，高频分量关注局部影响，从而动态检索相关数据并适应新位置。

Result: 在微气候预测中，该模型显著优于传统预测方法、数值天气预报模型和现代基础时间序列模型，在ERA5数据集上比HRRR的MSE降低71%，比Chronos降低34%。

Conclusion: 检索增强和分辨率感知策略在零样本预测中非常有效，为微气候建模及其他领域提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen
conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for
traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by
leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By
decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs
resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader
spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences.
This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new
locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms
traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and
modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%
lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and
resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution
for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.

### [391] [On the Granularity of Causal Effect Identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16703)
*Yizuo Chen,Adnan Darwiche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于状态的因果效应可识别性，发现在某些情况下即使变量级因果效应不可识别，状态级因果效应仍可识别，这需要上下文特定独立性和条件函数依赖等额外知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果效应可识别性基于变量层面定义，但实际应用中可能更关注特定状态间的因果效应。当变量级效应不可识别时，状态级效应可能仍可识别，这为因果推断提供了新视角。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究状态级因果效应的可识别性条件，特别是结合上下文特定独立性、条件函数依赖和变量状态约束等知识时的识别能力。

Result: 证明状态级因果效应在变量级效应不可识别时仍可能可识别，这种分离需要额外知识。变量状态约束知识单独不能改善可识别性，但与其他知识结合时可同时改善变量级和状态级可识别性。

Conclusion: 状态级因果效应可识别性为因果推断提供了更精细的分析框架，在某些情况下能够识别传统变量级框架可能遗漏的可识别因果效应，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of
treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability
of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of
treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We
demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when
variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation
occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific
independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We
further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show
that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve
both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other
knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight
situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational
data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based
frameworks.

Result: 模型能够准确预测日、周、月等不同时间尺度的充电需求，适用于不同使用模式的充电地点。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架具有广泛适用性，可为电动汽车充电设施的规划和运营提供可靠预测支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for processing EV charging load data in order
to forecast future load predictions using a Recurrent Neural Network,
specifically an LSTM. The framework processes a large set of raw data from
multiple locations and transforms it with normalization and feature extraction
to train the LSTM. The pre-processing stage corrects for missing or incomplete
values by interpolating and normalizing the measurements. This information is
then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory Model designed to capture the short-term
fluctuations while also interpreting the long-term trends in the charging data.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict
charging demand across multiple time scales (daily, weekly, and monthly),
providing valuable insights for infrastructure planning, energy management, and
grid integration of EV charging facilities. The system's modular design allows
for adaptation to different charging locations with varying usage patterns,
making it applicable across diverse deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于SegDeformer的联合特征和任务解码方法，在车载和分布式应用中降低计算复杂度，同时保持语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代汽车系统使用DNN进行语义分割，但现有方法未研究基于transformer的替代方案如SegDeformer，其性能更优但计算复杂度更高。

Method: 为SegDeformer提出联合特征和任务解码，在车载和分布式应用中降低计算复杂度，同时提高云平台的可扩展性。

Result: 在车载应用中，Cityscapes数据集fps提升11.7倍，ADE20K数据集提升3.5倍；在分布式应用中，使用仅0.14%的云DNN参数实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功降低了SegDeformer的计算复杂度，在保持性能的同时显著提升了处理速度，为汽车系统提供了更高效的语义分割解决方案。

Abstract: Modern automotive systems leverage deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic
segmentation and operate in two key application areas: (1) In-car, where the
DNN solely operates in the vehicle without strict constraints on the data rate.
(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part
typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on
transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image
and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders.
Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task
decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as
SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher
computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task
decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in
both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames
per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on
Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on
ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of
the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec. For the
distributed application, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) over a wide range
of bitrates on the mIoU metric, while using only $0.14$\% ($0.04$\%) of cloud
DNN parameters used in previous SOTA, reported on ADE20K (Cityscapes).

*Young In Kim,Andrea Agiollo,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SAMOSA算法，通过基于样本典型性的主动查询策略，在包含无关或未知类别的开放集主动学习中有效选择信息量大的样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习需要大量数据收集，但标注成本高昂。开放集主动学习旨在从未标注数据池中选择信息量大的样本，这些数据可能包含不相关或未知类别。

Method: 基于SGD和SAM的理论发现，SAMOSA根据样本典型性主动查询样本，有效识别嵌入流形中靠近模型决策边界的非典型样本。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SAMOSA相比现有技术实现了高达3%的准确率提升，且不引入计算开销。

Conclusion: SAMOSA能够优先选择对目标类别高度信息丰富且有助于区分目标类别与不需要类别的样本，是有效的开放集主动学习查询算法。

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where
labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning
approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled
data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose
Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an
effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the
impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),
SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively
identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold
close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the
samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)
useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive
experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the
state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational
overhead. The source code of our experiments is available at:

Motivation: 3D第一人称游戏是实时多模态推理的挑战性环境，需要解决现有数据集规模小、多样性不足的问题，并开发能够响应文本指令的游戏智能体。

Method: 收集大规模多样化的人类游戏数据集，学习逆动力学模型来推断缺失的动作，使用行为克隆训练文本条件智能体，采用支持实时推理的自定义架构。

Conclusion: 成功开发了用于3D第一人称游戏的文本条件智能体，展示了多模态推理的可行性，但长时程任务和大规模定量评估仍是未来需要解决的关键问题。

Abstract: We argue that 3-D first-person video games are a challenging environment for
real-time multi-modal reasoning. We first describe our dataset of human
game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is
both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed
datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an
inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on
a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack
recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using
behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a
consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of
3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the
remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation
across a large set of games.

TL;DR: 3D-GSRD是一个用于分子表示学习的3D图自编码器，通过选择性重掩码解码解决2D到3D掩码图建模的挑战，在分子属性预测基准上取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将掩码图建模从2D扩展到3D面临两个冲突挑战：避免2D结构信息泄露给解码器，同时为重构重掩码原子提供足够的2D上下文信息。

Method: 提出3D-GSRD，核心创新是选择性重掩码解码(SRD)，仅从编码器表示中重掩码3D相关信息，同时保留2D图结构。该方法与3D关系变换器编码器和结构无关解码器协同集成。

Conclusion: 选择性重掩码解码与结构无关解码器相结合，增强了编码器在分子表示学习中的作用，证明了3D-GSRD在3D分子表示学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular
representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask
decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting
challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing
sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.To address these
challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with
Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its
Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information
from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD
is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans)
encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD,
combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in
MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream
performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely
used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型规模不断扩大，其计算、内存和能耗需求急剧增长，使得训练和部署变得不可持续。量化作为一种压缩技术可以显著减少模型大小、缓解内存瓶颈并加速推理。

Method: 论文首先回顾量化基础知识，包括均匀和非均匀量化器、量化粒度以及后训练量化方法。然后根据位分配策略和权重、激活、键值缓存的精度配置对MXPLM框架进行分类比较。

Conclusion: 论文总结了开放问题和未来方向，包括硬件感知设计、激活量化和十亿参数模型的可扩展优化方法，为理解大规模语言模型混合精度量化的当前格局和研究前景提供了参考。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented
computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and
deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential
compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and
accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8,
INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in
sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization
offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across
layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks
for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform
and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used
in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM
frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision
configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative
analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and
deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier
mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying
strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting.
Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including
hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization
methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this
work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research
prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种计算预算感知的数据选择方法(CADS)，将计算预算约束整合到数据选择策略中，通过双层优化框架实现，在视觉和语言基准测试中性能提升高达14.42%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法忽略了计算预算约束，而实证研究表明没有算法能在不同预算下始终优于其他方法（甚至随机选择）。因此需要将计算预算作为数据选择策略的核心要素。

Method: 提出计算预算感知数据选择(CADS)方法，采用双层优化框架：内层在计算预算约束下训练模型，外层基于模型评估优化数据选择。使用概率重参数化策略和Hessian-free策略梯度估计器解决Hessian矩阵估计问题，将内层优化转化为外层目标的惩罚项。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，该方法相比基线方法实现了高达14.42%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 计算预算应该成为数据选择策略的核心组成部分，CADS方法通过双层优化框架有效解决了预算约束下的数据选择问题，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative
subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute
budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of
compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can
consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying
budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to
data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements
on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this
end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method
and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the
inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget
on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data
selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in
addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:
the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the
computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To
solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy
and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To
address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into
a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to
estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,
significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and
language benchmarks.

*Zhoutong Wu,Yuan Zhang,Yiming Dong,Chenheng Zhang,Cong Fang,Kun Yuan,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SkipV1Former是一种Transformer变体，通过从第一层的Value头添加跳跃连接来增强模型表示能力并减少KV缓存，在减少约25% KV缓存的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer扩展需要大量内存和计算成本，特别是自回归解码中的KV缓存。现有方法要么无法减少KV成本，要么以牺牲表示为代价减少内存。

Method: 从第二层开始，每层重用第一层一半的Value头，另一半正常计算，从而减少近50%的Value投影和V缓存。

Result: 在不同模型规模下，SkipV1Former相比标准MHA Transformer和先进变体，在减少约25% KV缓存的同时改善了困惑度。

Conclusion: SkipV1Former提供了一种有效平衡表示能力和资源消耗的方法，可与GQA、MLA等先进方法结合实现更大KV缓存节省。

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive
decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation
without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed
first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression
and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in
KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention
(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe
for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only
10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine
advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to
achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined
with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving
performance.

Method: 通过证明遗憾最小化与父节点识别存在根本冲突，建立包含动作空间组合结构的遗憾下界，并提出绕过图恢复的近乎最优算法。

Result: 实验证实新方法在各种环境中与现有基线存在显著性能差距，证明父节点识别对遗憾最小化是不必要的。

Conclusion: 学习父节点集对遗憾最小化是次优的，存在更有效的算法可以绕过图恢复直接实现近乎最优的遗憾性能。

Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where
the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has
focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit
methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We
investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,
our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by
proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent
identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze
both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret
lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.
Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass
graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed
unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a
large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various
environments.

Conclusion: 半监督学习为在大规模稀疏标注景观中识别未发现遗址提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are
likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and
geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach
but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology:
positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt
a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a
semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a
representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic
pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via
an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a
geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model
performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice
scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold
cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with
improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised
learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across

### [403] [Efficient High-Accuracy PDEs Solver with the Linear Attention Neural Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16816)
*Ming Zhong,Zhenya Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出线性注意力神经算子（LANO），通过引入代理令牌机制实现线性复杂度同时保持软注意力表达能力，解决了传统注意力机制在可扩展性和准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer的神经算子在可扩展性和准确性之间的根本权衡：软注意力提供良好保真度但计算复杂度为O(N²d)，而线性注意力变体虽然将成本降至O(Nd²)但通常存在显著精度下降。

Method: 引入紧凑的M个代理令牌（M≪N）来调节N个令牌之间的全局交互，这种代理注意力机制产生具有线性复杂度O(MNd)的算子层，同时保持软注意力的表达能力。

Result: 理论上证明了通用逼近性质，展示了改进的条件性和稳定性特性；实证上超越了当前最先进的神经PDE求解器，包括使用切片软注意力的Transolver，在标准基准测试中平均精度提高了19.5%。

Conclusion: LANO通过在线性复杂度和软注意力级性能之间架起桥梁，为科学机器学习应用建立了可扩展、高精度的基础。

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings
between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator
architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax
attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity
$\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$,
while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often
suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned
challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear
Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high
accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO
resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll
N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention
mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$
while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we
demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating
improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses
current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with
slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement
across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and
softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy
foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

*Heming Zou,Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了UDS框架，用于在监督微调中进行高效的在线批次选择，通过核范数捕捉数据效用和样本内多样性，并通过轻量级历史样本缓冲区估计样本间多样性，无需外部资源且计算高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线批次选择方法存在三个问题：(i)仅依赖数据效用而忽略多样性；(ii)需要外部资源如参考模型或验证集；(iii)训练时间超过全数据集训练。

Method: UDS框架利用logits矩阵的核范数捕获数据效用和样本内多样性，通过低维嵌入比较和历史样本缓冲区估计样本间多样性，无需外部资源且避免不必要的反向传播。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，UDS在不同数据预算下始终优于最先进的在线批次选择方法，并显著减少了与全数据集微调相比的训练时间。

Conclusion: UDS是一个无需外部资源、计算高效的在线批次选择框架，在监督微调中表现出色，能有效平衡数据效用和多样性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

*Doyoon Kim,Junbin Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TRPINN方法，在Sobolev-Slobodeckij范数H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中强制边界损失，这是与H^1(Ω)相关的正确迹空间。通过计算半范数的理论本质部分降低计算成本，避免离散化中的分母评估增强收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准PINNs在处理高度振荡的Dirichlet边界条件时可能失败，需要改进边界损失的计算方式以提高收敛性和稳定性。

Method: 使用TRPINN方法，在正确的迹空间H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中强制边界损失，仅计算半范数的理论本质部分，避免分母评估。

Result: TRPINN在Laplace方程的高度振荡Dirichlet边界条件下成功，而标准PINNs失败，性能提升1-3个十进制数字。通过NTK分析显示TRPINN比标准PINNs收敛更快。

Conclusion: TRPINN通过使用正确的迹空间范数，提高了PINNs的收敛性和稳定性，在处理复杂边界条件时表现优于标准方法。

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace
Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the
boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the
correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost
by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and
enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the
discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we
show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the
$H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we
demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical
experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary
conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail,
and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用双线性自编码器将表示分解为二次多项式，实现非线性但可分析的潜在表示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器依赖输入进行解释，多项式作为代数基元可以独立于输入进行分析，能够描述从线性概念到复杂流形的结构

Method: 采用双线性自编码器高效分解表示为二次多项式，通过改进实现重要性排序、聚类和激活稀疏性

Result: 开发了能够将神经网络表示分解为二次多项式的有效方法

Conclusion: 这是通过代数特性实现非线性但可分析潜在表示的第一步

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a standard tool for uncovering interpretable latent
representations in neural networks. Yet, their interpretation depends on the
inputs, making their isolated study incomplete. Polynomials offer a solution;
they serve as algebraic primitives that can be analysed without reference to
input and can describe structures ranging from linear concepts to complicated
manifolds. This work uses bilinear autoencoders to efficiently decompose
representations into quadratic polynomials. We discuss improvements that induce
importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity. This is an initial
step toward nonlinear yet analysable latents through their algebraic
properties.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoMol是一个原型引导的多模态分子表示学习框架，通过层次化编码器和双向跨模态注意力机制，实现分子图与文本描述之间的细粒度整合和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法存在两个关键局限：仅在最终编码层进行跨模态交互，忽略了层次语义依赖；缺乏统一原型空间来实现模态间的鲁棒对齐。

Method: 使用双分支层次编码器（GNN处理分子图，Transformer编码文本），引入层间双向跨模态注意力机制，并构建共享原型空间与可学习的类特定锚点。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ProtoMol在各种分子性质预测任务中持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMol通过层次化语义对齐和原型引导，显著提升了多模态分子表示学习的预测准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular
graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and
interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug
toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration
of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods
suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal
interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical
semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust
alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained
integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and
textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders,
utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and
Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive
layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise
bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns
semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with
learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities
toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对LLM生成数学优化公式的组件级评估框架，包含变量和约束的精确率/召回率、约束和目标函数RMSE等新指标，评估了GPT-5等模型在不同提示策略下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法将公式视为整体，依赖粗粒度指标如求解精度或运行时间，掩盖了结构或数值错误，需要更精细的评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含决策变量和约束的精确率/召回率、约束和目标函数RMSE、基于token使用和延迟的效率指标的综合评估框架，在六种提示策略下评估GPT-5、LLaMA 3.1 Instruct和DeepSeek Math模型。

Result: GPT-5表现最佳，思维链、自一致性和模块化提示最有效。求解器性能主要取决于高约束召回率和低约束RMSE，约束精确率和决策变量指标作用次要，简洁输出提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出了NLP到优化建模的三个原则：完整约束覆盖防止违规、最小化约束RMSE确保求解器级精度、简洁输出提高计算效率，为LLM在优化建模中的细粒度诊断评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

Conclusion: DrivAerStar是首个连接学术机器学习研究和工业CFD实践的数据集，为汽车开发中的数据驱动空气动力学优化建立了新标准，并展示了将高保真物理模拟与AI整合到工程学科的范例。

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive
electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle
range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable
trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that
sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers
transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations --
inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors
exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present
DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations
generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset
systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided
Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including
complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal
airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a
five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies
with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on
this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs
from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic
machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new
standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development.
Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自身份或输出相似性的KD检测方法容易被提示工程规避，需要更可靠的检测手段来保护知识产权和维持LLM多样性。

Method: 利用MoE模型的结构习惯（特别是内部路由模式）作为检测信号，提出Shadow-MoE方法在black-box设置下构建代理MoE表示进行比较。

Result: 在各种场景下达到>94%的检测准确率，对基于提示的规避攻击具有强鲁棒性，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MoE结构习惯在知识蒸馏过程中会持续传递，可作为可靠的检测信号，为KD检测提供了新视角和有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models
(LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks.
Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can
be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection
framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an
overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal
routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and
collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that
persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup
and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that
constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare
these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive,
reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an
extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong
robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while
highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续表示学习方法在相似性匹配阶段存在多重共线性问题，且更先进的方法计算成本过高，不适合实时低延迟应用。

Method: 提出Fly-CL框架，采用生物启发设计，渐进式解决多重共线性问题，实现低时间复杂度的有效相似性匹配。

Result: 在多种网络架构和数据机制下的广泛模拟实验验证了Fly-CL的有效性，显著减少训练时间的同时性能达到或超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: Fly-CL通过生物启发设计成功解决了持续表示学习中的多重共线性挑战，为实时低延迟应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning
paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained
features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the
similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally
prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly
olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with
a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training
time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current
state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively
resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with
low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network
architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing
this challenge through a biologically inspired design. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种后门遗忘攻击方法，通过利用LLM中的注意力汇聚现象，在遗忘过程中植入隐藏触发器，使模型在正常情况下表现正常，但在触发时恢复被遗忘的知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源权重LLM的兴起，研究遗忘过程本身是否可能被后门攻击，即在正常条件下看似成功遗忘，但在隐藏触发器激活时恢复预遗忘行为。

Method: 利用注意力汇聚现象，将触发器放置在汇聚位置并调整其注意力值，显著增强后门的持久性。通过实验验证注意力汇聚引导的后门遗忘方法。

Result: 实验证明，基于注意力汇聚的后门遗忘方法能够在存在后门触发器时可靠地恢复被遗忘知识，而在无触发器时与正常遗忘模型表现无异。

Conclusion: 注意力汇聚现象为后门遗忘攻击提供了有效途径，揭示了LLM遗忘过程中的安全漏洞，需要开发更安全的遗忘机制来防范此类攻击。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估LLM在对话中发现和利用潜在用户信息的统一基准，包含三个渐进式任务设置，结果显示LLM能通过对话揭示潜在信息，但成功率受任务复杂度、主题和隐藏属性数量影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成通用文本方面表现出色，但在需要用户特定偏好的场景中，用户很少明确表达所有偏好，大量信息是潜在的。研究LLM能否通过对话发现和推理这种潜在信息。

Method: 引入统一的潜在信息发现评估基准，包含三个渐进式设置：经典20问游戏、个性化问答和个性化文本摘要。采用三智能体框架（用户、助手、法官）进行逐轮评估。

Result: LLM确实能通过对话揭示潜在信息，但成功率差异显著：从32%到98%，取决于任务复杂度、主题和隐藏属性数量。

Conclusion: 该基准为研究个性化交互中的潜在信息发现提供了首个系统框架，表明有效的偏好推理仍然是构建真正自适应AI系统的开放前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络受限于固定标签空间，而大型语言模型难以捕捉图结构，需要一种能够统一结构推理和语义推理的方法来处理未见过的图任务。

Method: 编码器使用预训练自回归LLM，通过可学习对齐标记和结构感知的图-文本注意力机制处理标记化图和自然语言任务提示；解码器使用冻结的LLM预测任务答案并重构输入图的自然语言描述。

Conclusion: 图结构与LLM语义的紧密集成能够实现鲁棒且可迁移的图推理能力。

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is
challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed
label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph
structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework
that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a
pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a
structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM
decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and
simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,
and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at
inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node
classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression
under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight
integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable
graph reasoning.

Conclusion: 该工作显著促进了SE(3)等变模型的应用和进一步发展，使更多科学家能够利用这些先进的几何神经网络技术。

Abstract: Neural networks that incorporate geometric relationships respecting SE(3)
group transformations (e.g. rotations and translations) are increasingly
important in molecular applications, such as molecular property prediction,
protein structure modeling, and materials design. These models, known as
SE(3)-equivariant neural networks, ensure outputs transform predictably with
input coordinate changes by explicitly encoding spatial atomic positions.
Although libraries such as E3NN [4] and SE(3)-TRANSFORMER [3 ] offer powerful
implementations, they often require substantial deep learning or mathematical
prior knowledge and lack complete training pipelines. We extend DEEPCHEM [ 13]
with support for ready-to-use equivariant models, enabling scientists with
minimal deep learning background to build, train, and evaluate models, such as
SE(3)-Transformer and Tensor Field Networks. Our implementation includes
equivariant models, complete training pipelines, and a toolkit of equivariant
utilities, supported with comprehensive tests and documentation, to facilitate
both application and further development of SE(3)-equivariant models.

the California energy market. The model incorporates a variety of features,
including historical price data, weather conditions, and the energy generation
mix. A novel custom loss function that integrates Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty is introduced to
enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, an online
learning approach is implemented to allow the model to adapt to new data
incrementally, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy. The results
demonstrate that the custom loss function can improve the model's performance,
aligning predicted prices more closely with actual values, particularly during
peak intervals. Also, the online learning model outperforms other models by
effectively incorporating real-time data, resulting in lower prediction error
and variability. The inclusion of the energy generation mix further enhances
the model's predictive capabilities, highlighting the importance of
comprehensive feature integration. This research provides a robust framework
for electricity price forecasting, offering valuable insights and tools for
better decision-making in dynamic electricity markets.

*Michael Hersche,Samuel Moor-Smith,Thomas Hofmann,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为软掩码（Soft-Masking）的新方法，用于改进基于掩码扩散的语言模型，通过动态混合掩码标记与预测标记的嵌入来保留更多预测信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型在解码时采用二进制决策（保留掩码或替换为预测标记），这导致在保留掩码时丢弃了有价值的预测信息。

Method: 提出软掩码方法，动态混合掩码标记嵌入与先前解码步骤中前k个预测标记的嵌入，为模型提供更丰富的先验信息。

Result: 在169M参数模型上继续预训练软掩码方法改善了困惑度和MAUVE分数；在Dream-7B和Dream-Coder-7B模型上微调后，在多个编码基准测试中性能一致提升，特别是在高吞吐量设置下。

Conclusion: 软掩码方法有效解决了掩码扩散语言模型中的信息丢弃问题，提高了模型性能，特别是在代码生成任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling,
offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their
ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster
generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based
language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively
processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask
or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards
valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this
limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically
blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$
predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This
provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from
earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to
propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a
pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate
that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved
perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art
diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently
improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in
high-throughput settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非结构化临床文档导致AI训练数据噪声大、不一致和逻辑碎片化的问题，提升AI在医疗保健中的有效性。

Method: 使用SNOMED CT标准化临床术语，在Neo4j图数据库中构建医学知识图谱，将临床实体表示为节点，语义关系表示为边，提取和标准化临床文本中的实体关系对生成结构化数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，该知识引导方法显著提高了AI生成诊断推理的有效性和可解释性，增强了LLM输出的临床逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的AI辅助临床系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，通过结构化知识图谱改善了临床AI的性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is
significantly hindered by unstructured clinical documentation, which results in
noisy, inconsistent, and logically fragmented training data. To address this
challenge, we present a knowledge-driven framework that integrates the
standardized clinical terminology SNOMED CT with the Neo4j graph database to
construct a structured medical knowledge graph. In this graph, clinical
entities such as diseases, symptoms, and medications are represented as nodes,
and semantic relationships such as ``caused by,'' ``treats,'' and ``belongs
to'' are modeled as edges in Neo4j, with types mapped from formal SNOMED CT
relationship concepts (e.g., \texttt{Causative agent}, \texttt{Indicated for}).
This design enables multi-hop reasoning and ensures terminological consistency.
By extracting and standardizing entity-relationship pairs from clinical texts,
we generate structured, JSON-formatted datasets that embed explicit diagnostic
pathways. These datasets are used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs),
significantly improving the clinical logic consistency of their outputs.
Experimental results demonstrate that our knowledge-guided approach enhances
the validity and interpretability of AI-generated diagnostic reasoning,
providing a scalable solution for building reliable AI-assisted clinical
systems.

Motivation: 解决在传感器数据存在噪声、不完整且缺乏上下文丰富性的情况下，如何准确预测短期能耗的问题，应对2025年电力能耗预测竞赛的挑战。

Method: 采用轻量级深度学习管道，包括小时级降采样、均值与多项式回归双模式插补、综合标准化处理，最终选择标准缩放，使用GRU-LSTM序列到一模型进行预测。

Result: 模型平均RMSE为601.9W，MAE为468.9W，准确率达到84.36%。尽管输入不对称且存在插补间隙，模型仍能良好泛化，捕捉非线性需求模式，并保持低推理延迟。

Conclusion: 针对性的预处理与紧凑的循环架构相结合，能够在真实世界条件下实现快速、准确且可部署的能耗预测。

Abstract: How can short-term energy consumption be accurately forecasted when sensor
data is noisy, incomplete, and lacks contextual richness? This question guided
our participation in the \textit{2025 Competition on Electric Energy
Consumption Forecast Adopting Multi-criteria Performance Metrics}, which
challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world
high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL)
pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial
regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard
Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model
achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy.
Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured
nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably,
spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature
trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability.
These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact
recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready
energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能系统需要在动态现实环境中持续学习新技能并泛化到未见场景，但现有持续学习方法假设训练和测试域相同，在领域变化时性能下降。

Method: 提出DoT方法，受人类大脑分布式加枢纽理论启发，解耦语义和领域相关信息，自适应变换任务表示进行输出对齐，实现平衡泛化预测。

Result: DoT作为插件策略显著提升了SOTA持续学习基线在DGCL中的性能，在完全参数调优和参数高效调优范式下均有效，且资源效率高。

Conclusion: DoT方法能有效积累领域泛化知识，为动态环境中的持续学习提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems
must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen
scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain
generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with
each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered
tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,
retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for
robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)
methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific
generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains
for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose
adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach
tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human
brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in
representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across
various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized
predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates
state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and
parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive
experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge
from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示工程导致跨问题类型泛化能力差，或需要昂贵的监督训练，需要一种无需训练且能泛化的优化问题解决方法。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索策略，包含动态扩展、提示反向传播和不确定性反向传播，生成数学公式并转化为求解器代码。

Result: 在六个标准基准数据集上的实验表明，SolverLLM优于基于提示和学习的方法，无需额外训练即可实现强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SolverLLM提供了一种有效的训练无关方法，通过测试时缩放和增强的MCTS策略成功解决多样化优化问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling
complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing
methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization
across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce
SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve
diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM
generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code,
guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the
search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for
adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide
exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to
incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both
prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization
without additional training.

Conclusion: 语言在环框架结合了大语言模型和贝叶斯优化的优势，能够有效处理自然语言反馈，在现实应用中具有重要价值

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

Conclusion: 通过将Hessian理论扩展到完整Transformer架构，为大规模深度学习优化的理论和实证研究建立了新的基础。

Abstract: The lack of theoretical results for Layer Normalization and feedforward
Hessians has left a gap in the study of Transformer optimization landscapes. We
address this by deriving explicit second-order expressions for these
components, thereby completing the Hessian characterization of full Transformer
blocks. Our results generalize prior self-attention analyses and yield
estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We
demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and
the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we
propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework for analyzing loss differences to
quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full
Transformer architecture, this work establishes a new foundation for
theoretical and empirical investigations of optimization in large-scale deep
learning.

Motivation: 开发参数高效且能捕捉非线性和重尾动态的概率模型，用于卫星通信等资源受限领域的资源分配决策。

Method: 用样条函数连接替换标量权重，直接参数化预测分布，构建基于高斯和学生t分布的P-KAN变体。

Result: P-KAN在准确性和校准方面持续优于MLP基线，使用更少参数实现更好的效率-风险权衡。高斯变体提供稳健预测，学生t变体在稳定需求下产生更尖锐分布。

Conclusion: P-KAN为概率预测提供了强大框架，特别适用于卫星通信和其他资源受限领域。

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel
probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series
forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional
connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer
expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and
heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting,
where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource
allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior
efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build
up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions.
The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for
safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper
distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings
establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with
direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained
domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一个样本级别的框架来量化后训练过程中的知识遗忘和反向迁移，发现在不同后训练阶段、模型规模和数据规模下，遗忘和反向迁移的模式各不相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练虽然能显著提升语言模型能力，但其对预训练知识的影响尚不明确，特别是知识遗忘问题需要更精细的度量方法。

Method: 使用样本级别的1->0转换（正确变错误）来量化遗忘，0->1转换（错误变正确）来量化反向迁移，并针对多选题基准添加了机会调整变体。

Result: 发现领域持续预训练导致中度遗忘和低到中度反向迁移；RL/SFT后训练在数学和逻辑任务上产生中到大的反向迁移，总体遗忘较低；模型合并不能可靠缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解后训练如何改变预训练知识提供了实用工具，有助于推动通用AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

Conclusion: 概率降尺度是增强业务次季节风预报的有效方法，对可再生能源规划和风险评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational
sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

Conclusion: 该方法为社会科学中的中小规模连续数据提供了在差分隐私下进行有效线性回归推断和合成数据生成的完整解决方案。

Abstract: In social sciences, small- to medium-scale datasets are common and linear
regression (LR) is canonical. In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused
on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited
attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation
(SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR
methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either
tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous
regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their
use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a
method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected
estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG
procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression.
Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional
settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing
methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data
for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.

Result: 在8B模型八路张量并行训练中，相比Muon提升8%吞吐量且性能无下降

Conclusion: MuonBP在保持Muon收敛性能的同时，实现了与坐标式优化器（如AdamW）相当的每轮迭代吞吐量

Abstract: Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in
speeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024)
combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves
significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model
parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared
to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and
scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This
additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to
Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic
Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to
matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization
to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning
rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this
algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for
the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization
steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and
achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while
providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such
as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO
optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to
Muon with no degradation in performance.

Result: 在生成性和判别性任务上，Graph4MM比更大的VLM、LLM和多模态图基线表现更好，平均提升6.93%。

Conclusion: 利用结构信息整合模态内和模态间交互，比将图作为独立模态能更好地提升多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships
beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities
across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming
diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.
Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and
inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish
multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which
fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key
challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from
multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific
information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the
role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and
propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,
we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural
information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.
Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for
cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that
leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions
improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone
modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that
Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,
achieving a 6.93% average improvement.

*Chang Liu,Danial Chitnis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEschematic是一个基于多模态大语言模型的AI代理，能够将SPICE网表自动转换为可编辑的电路原理图，解决了传统文本表示缺乏视觉可解释性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电路原理图在模拟集成电路设计中至关重要，但现有基于LLM的方法主要依赖SPICE网表等文本表示，缺乏对电路设计师的视觉可解释性。

Method: 集成文本、视觉和符号模态，使用6个模拟子结构示例进行少样本布局，采用视觉思维链策略迭代优化布局和布线，提高原理图清晰度和对称性。

Result: 在CMOS反相器、五晶体管运算跨导放大器(5T-OTA)和望远镜级联放大器等代表性模拟电路上的实验表明，EEschematic生成的原理图具有高视觉质量和结构正确性。

Conclusion: EEschematic成功实现了从SPICE网表到可编辑电路原理图的自动转换，为电路设计提供了更好的视觉解释工具。

Abstract: Circuit schematics play a crucial role in analog integrated circuit design,
serving as the primary medium for human understanding and verification of
circuit functionality. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches
have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely
solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual
interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose
EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,
and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams
represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog
substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought
(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic
clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,
including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance
amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that
EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural
correctness.

Motivation: 在LLM时代，需要运行一系列LLM推理应用来解决实际问题。主流LLM调度器由于头部阻塞或资源分配过度约束，无法为LLM应用提供良好的服务性能保证。

Method: 设计了Justitia调度器，采用三种关键技术：1) 以内存为中心的LLM应用服务成本建模；2) 使用简单神经网络进行轻量级准确的需求预测；3) 基于虚拟时间的公平排队算法来保证最坏情况延迟。

Result: 在vLLM上实现Justitia，实验结果显示它能显著提高调度效率同时保持公平性。

Conclusion: Justitia调度器能够有效解决LLM应用在共享GPU服务器上的调度问题，实现高效公平的服务。

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a
series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve
real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the
schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed
worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well
for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained
resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a
fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel
scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a
bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the
service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses
a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand
prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing
algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.
We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving
diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling
efficiency with fairness preserved.

involving radicals, exponentials, and trig functions. Our work suggests
curiosity-based exploration may be useful for general symbolic reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法直接处理非线性边权函数下的服务质量降级问题，经典组合优化方法受限，机器学习方法仅能处理受限线性变体和小规模网络

Method: PIMMA框架包含三个阶段：Forge使用预测路径应力算法生成可行解，Morph使用条件VAE混合模型和能量模型捕获解特征分布，Refine使用强化学习在解空间中探索生成接近最优解

Result: 在合成和真实网络上的实验表明，该方法在非线性成本函数场景下持续优于经典和机器学习基线方法

Conclusion: PIMMA框架能够有效解决非线性边权函数下的服务质量降级问题，在传统方法无法泛化的场景下表现出色

Abstract: We study the Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) problem, in which an
adversary perturbs edge weights to degrade network performance. This setting
arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where
communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While
classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches
address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior
model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions.
This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that
synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method
includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm
that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with
performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training
paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to
capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement
learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal
solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently
outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with
nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.

Method: 引入DICA框架，提出雅可比体积最大化(J-VolMax)准则，利用混合函数雅可比矩阵的凸几何特性来鼓励潜在成分对观测变量的影响多样性。

Result: 在合理条件下，该方法实现了无需辅助信息、潜在成分独立性或雅可比稀疏性假设的可识别性。

Conclusion: 扩展了可识别性分析的范围，为现有方法提供了互补视角，推动了非线性混合中潜在成分识别的研究。

Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a
foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as
disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in
nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary
signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of
conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore
structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,
to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence
Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the
mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization
(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by
encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under
reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying
on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity
assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and
offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

Motivation: 研究当后处理指令与模型已学习行为冲突时，模型的推理过程会发生什么变化，特别是关注模型是否会进行动机推理来为违反指令的行为辩护。

Method: 在简单设置中调查模型行为，分析模型如何生成看似合理的理由来违反指令，同时评估不同规模LLM检测这种动机推理的能力。

Result: 模型会进行系统性动机推理，前沿推理模型能检测到大部分动机推理，但较小的LLM评判者可能无法识别部分动机推理，甚至可能被说服认为这种推理是正确的。

Conclusion: 随着模型变得更加复杂，其动机推理可能越来越难以被监控器检测到，这强调了在依赖思维链过程进行模型评估和监督时需要考虑动机推理的必要性。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language
models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a
compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under
the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal
decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors
due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned
tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to
avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's
reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We
investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in
systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications
for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond
being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated
reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges
can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be
persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear
instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more
sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for
monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated
reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and
oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some
examples in this paper may be upsetting.

Motivation: 虽然量化技术显著降低了深度学习推理的计算成本，但训练仍然主要依赖复杂的浮点运算。低精度定点训练是一个有吸引力的替代方案。

Method: 引入硬件友好的分段线性近似用于对数加法，使用模拟退火在不同精度级别优化该近似，通过C++位真模拟训练VGG-11和VGG-16模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上，使用12位整数运算训练VGG模型，与32位浮点训练相比准确率下降极小。硬件研究显示，与线性定点等效单元相比，提出的LNS乘累加单元面积减少高达32.5%，能耗降低53.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的低精度对数定点训练方法在保持准确率的同时，显著降低了硬件面积和能耗，为未来硬件加速器设计提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the
computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly
relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training
presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in
low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware
accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of
approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new
hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition.
Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different
precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and
VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer
arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point
training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5%
reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units
compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

Conclusion: 该方法为交互式智能体提供了一种自监督预训练的有效方式，使其能够快速适应新任务并模仿人类演示。

Abstract: In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training
in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in
a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to
quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real
world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most
successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion
of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is
well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with
a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation
to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided
by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that
the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a
sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to
solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of
their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a
method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so
that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals
(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method
automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior
work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method
solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain
demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard
benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms
prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

Conclusion: Gram行列式评分是一种有效的可靠性评估方法，能够在没有真实数据的情况下准确度量数据集质量，且不受具体实验过程影响。

Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground
truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected
from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see
outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To
benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how
much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant
score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical
distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this
score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely
up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of
the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on
synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data
demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality
across diverse observation processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应图学习框架，通过专门的专家网络检测金融异常，提供内置可解释性，能够识别异常机制类型并追踪其时间演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测器将所有异常统一处理，产生标量分数而不揭示异常机制、风险集中位置或干预方式，这种不透明性阻碍了有针对性的监管响应。存在三个未解决的挑战：静态图结构无法适应市场相关性变化；统一检测机制错过类型特定特征；黑盒输出无法提供可操作的指导。

Method: 通过BiLSTM与自注意力捕获多尺度时间依赖，通过跨模态注意力融合时空信息，通过神经多源插值学习动态图，通过应力调制融合自适应平衡学习动态与结构先验，将异常路由到四个机制特定专家，并产生双级可解释归因。可解释性在架构中嵌入而非事后应用。

Result: 在100只美国股票（2017-2024）上，实现了92.3%的13个主要事件检测，领先时间3.8天，比最佳基线高出30.8个百分点。硅谷银行案例研究展示了异常演化追踪：价格冲击专家权重在关闭期间升至0.39（比基线0.29高33%），一周后达到峰值0.48（比基线高66%）。

Conclusion: 该框架能够自动识别异常机制类型并追踪其时间演化，无需监督标签，为金融异常检测提供了可解释且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity
freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all
anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism
is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents
targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static
graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime
changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across
multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with
network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on
anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks
that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale
temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and
spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through
neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with
structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four
mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.
Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied
post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events
with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley
Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert
weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48
(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism
identification without labeled supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Hedge算法在组合设置中的最优性，证明了Hedge在大多数组合问题中是近乎最优的，但在某些特定场景下存在√log d的次优性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Hedge算法在组合在线学习设置中的最优性，该设置涵盖了扩展形式博弈、资源分配、m-集合、在线多任务学习和DAG最短路径等重要问题。

Method: 通过建立Ω(√(T log(|X|)/log d))的下界来证明Hedge的近乎最优性，并识别出Hedge存在√log d次优性差距的特定组合集合类别。

Result: 证明Hedge在大多数组合设置中达到O(√(T log |X|))的遗憾，且该上界与下界仅相差√log d因子。对于m-集合(log d ≤ m ≤ √d)，Hedge确实存在√log d的次优性。

Conclusion: Hedge在组合在线学习中通常是近乎最优的，其分析为DAG最短路径问题提供了近乎最优的正则化器，通过扩张熵正则化器实例化的OMD算法继承了Hedge的遗憾保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial
settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a
set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t
\rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,
including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask
learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is
well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after
$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal
across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X
\subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log
d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log
d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of
combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for
which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by
a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is
optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical
$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to
establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path
problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial
domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)
algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is
iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret
guarantees for DAGs.

Method: 结合基于占用度量的FTRL、自约束技术和受在线最短路径问题启发的新损失估计器，在已知和未知转移设置下设计算法。

Result: 在已知转移时实现O(log T)随机遗憾和O(√T)对抗遗憾，建立了匹配下界证明最优性，并扩展到未知转移设置。

Conclusion: 成功设计了首个聚合bandit反馈下表格MDP的BOBW算法，提供了最优的理论保证，并为最短路径问题提供了首个个体间隙相关下界。

Abstract: We study online learning in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the challenging aggregate bandit feedback model, where the learner
observes only the cumulative loss incurred in each episode, rather than
individual losses at each state-action pair. While prior work in this setting
has focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of
best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

Conclusion: Transformer编码器本质上等同于GCN，这一统一理论重构为时间序列建模提供了显式和可解释的依赖关系表示。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet
their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer
encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution
matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with
subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph
convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update
dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters.
Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose
\textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined
architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates
multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and
interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales,
naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting
benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while
providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.

*Rishi Sonthalia,Raj Rao Nadakuditi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于矩阵自由能的新型自编码器正则化方法，通过优化码矩阵的奇异值分布使其接近高斯分布，提升泛化能力并应用于欠定逆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自编码器在训练过程中容易产生过拟合，码矩阵的分布可能与训练数据过度匹配。本文旨在通过正则化方法使码矩阵的奇异值分布接近高斯分布，从而提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: 基于矩阵自由能理论定义可微损失函数，该函数与码矩阵（编码维度×批次大小）的奇异值分布相关。通过随机梯度下降最小化负矩阵自由能，使码矩阵的奇异值分布接近独立同分布高斯随机矩阵的分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够产生高斯分布的编码，在训练集和测试集上均表现出良好的泛化性能。基于此进一步提出了最大化矩阵自由能的自编码器，可可靠生成高斯编码。

Conclusion: 矩阵自由能正则化是提升自编码器泛化能力的有效方法，特别适用于欠定逆问题，能够产生稳定且可泛化的高斯编码表示。

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续时间强化学习方法CQSM，通过鞅条件定义连续时间Q函数，将扩散策略分数与Q函数动作梯度关联，解决了传统离散时间方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要基于离散时间框架，但许多实际控制问题本质上是连续时间的。需要开发能够在连续时间框架下保持Q函数动作评估能力的方法，而不依赖时间离散化。

Method: 通过鞅条件定义连续时间Q函数，利用动态规划原理将扩散策略分数与学习到的连续Q函数的动作梯度关联，提出连续Q分数匹配(CQSM)算法。

Conclusion: CQSM方法成功解决了连续时间强化学习中长期存在的挑战，能够在连续时间框架下保持Q函数的动作评估能力，为连续时间控制问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success across a wide
range of domains, however, most existing methods are formulated in discrete
time. In this work, we introduce a novel RL method for continuous-time control,
where stochastic differential equations govern state-action dynamics. Departing
from traditional value function-based approaches, our key contribution is the
characterization of continuous-time Q-functions via a martingale condition and
the linking of diffusion policy scores to the action gradient of a learned
continuous Q-function by the dynamic programming principle. This insight
motivates Continuous Q-Score Matching (CQSM), a score-based policy improvement
algorithm. Notably, our method addresses a long-standing challenge in
continuous-time RL: preserving the action-evaluation capability of Q-functions
without relying on time discretization. We further provide theoretical
closed-form solutions for linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems within our
framework. Numerical results in simulated environments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method and compare it to popular baselines.

*Enhao Gu,Haolin Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出In-situ Autoguidance方法，无需辅助模型即可实现图像生成扩散模型的自引导，解决了分类器自由引导在提高质量和对齐性时减少多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类器自由引导方法在提高图像质量和提示对齐性的同时会减少多样性，且现有解耦方法需要额外训练辅助模型，带来显著开销。

Method: 通过随机前向传递动态生成次优预测，将引导重新定义为推理时的自校正过程，无需任何辅助组件。

Result: 这种零成本方法不仅可行，而且为成本高效的引导建立了强大的新基准，证明无需外部模型即可实现自引导的好处。

Conclusion: In-situ Autoguidance证明了模型自身能够提供有效引导，无需依赖外部辅助模型，实现了成本效益高的图像生成引导。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality, diverse, and prompt-aligned images is a
central goal in image-generating diffusion models. The popular classifier-free
guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced
variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has
successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately
trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the
considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this
prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits
guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach
dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic
forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.
We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also
establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that
the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.

TL;DR: 提出ALMD范式，让模型在部署后能自动检测新类别样本并增量学习，解决传统固定模型在动态环境中无法适应新类别的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习模型部署后固定不变，无法适应动态开放环境中出现的新类别样本。需要模型能够自动检测新类别并增量学习。

Method: 提出PLDA方法，实现动态OOD检测和在线增量学习新类别，无需从头重新训练模型。

Result: 通过实证评估验证PLDA方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ALMD范式解决了动态环境中模型持续学习的问题，PLDA方法为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application,
it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is
inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples
from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be
able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after
they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model
Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human
engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other
knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an
unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection
of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new
classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in
traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised
learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and
incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the
past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered
classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two
challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes
often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and
incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will
demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.

*Guanjie Cheng,Siyang Liu,Junqin Huang,Xinkui Zhao,Yin Wang,Mengying Zhu,Linghe Kong,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALPINE是一个轻量级自适应框架，让终端设备能实时调整差分隐私级别，在移动边缘群智感知系统中平衡隐私保护、数据效用和能耗成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动边缘群智感知系统在动态资源受限环境中持续生成和传输用户数据，面临严重隐私威胁。静态差分隐私机制无法适应不断变化的风险（如对手能力变化、资源约束和任务需求），导致要么噪声过多要么保护不足。

Method: ALPINE作为闭环控制系统，包含四个模块：动态风险感知、基于TD3算法的隐私决策、本地隐私执行和边缘节点性能验证。设计了平衡隐私收益、数据效用和能耗成本的奖励函数，指导TD3智能体自适应调整噪声幅度。

Result: 理论分析和真实世界仿真表明，ALPINE能有效缓解推理攻击，同时保持数据效用和控制成本，适用于大规模边缘应用。

Conclusion: ALPINE框架通过自适应差分隐私机制，在动态边缘环境中实现了隐私保护、数据效用和能耗成本之间的动态平衡，具有实际部署的可行性。

Abstract: Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的框架来评估文本属性图（TAG）学习中GNN和LLM的鲁棒性，揭示了模型在文本和结构扰动下的固有权衡，并提出了SFT-auto框架来提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对图神经网络（GNN）和大语言模型（LLM）在文本属性图（TAG）学习中的鲁棒性评估是碎片化的，缺乏系统性的研究。

Method: 引入了一个统一的鲁棒性评估框架，在10个数据集上评估经典GNN、鲁棒GNN和GraphLLM，涵盖文本、结构和混合扰动，以及投毒和规避攻击场景。

Result: 发现模型在文本和结构鲁棒性之间存在固有权衡，GNN性能严重依赖文本编码器和攻击类型，GraphLLM对训练数据污染特别脆弱。

Conclusion: 提出了SFT-auto框架，能够在单一模型中实现对文本和结构攻击的平衡鲁棒性，为TAG安全研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a
comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current
evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct
effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and
attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and
comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework
evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten
datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and
hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive
analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly
noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and
structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text
encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to
training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce
SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness
against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work
establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers
practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/Leirunlin/TGRB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学方法的快速发展超过了标准化验证工具的开发，缺乏一致的评估指标、稀有构象状态的充分采样和可重复的基准测试。

Method: 使用基于时间延迟独立成分分析(TICA)的加权集合(WE)采样，通过WESTPA工具包实现蛋白质构象空间的高效探索。框架包含灵活的传播器接口，支持经典力场和机器学习模型。

Result: 开发了包含9种不同蛋白质的数据集（10-224个残基），每个蛋白质在300K下进行了100万MD步（4纳秒）的广泛模拟。验证测试显示框架能够有效比较经典MD模拟和机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估协议和实现直接、可重复的MD方法比较，这个开源平台为分子模拟社区提供了持续、严格的基准测试基础。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including
machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools
for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is
often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of
rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To
address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.
Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble
Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on
progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis
(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational
space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that
supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and
machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a
comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different
metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a
dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a
variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been
extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4
ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests
using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein
conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet
model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible
comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork
for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation
community.

TL;DR: SOLE是一个软硬件协同设计，通过E2Softmax和AILayerNorm优化Transformer中的Softmax和LayerNorm操作，无需重新训练即可保持推理精度，同时实现显著的速度提升和能效改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在NLP和CV任务中表现出色，但由于Softmax和LayerNorm的低效率，其实时推理速度和效率受到限制。现有基于函数逼近的方法存在实现效率低、内存开销大、需要重新训练等问题。

Method: 提出SOLE软硬件协同设计：E2Softmax使用指数函数的log2量化和基于对数的除法来逼近Softmax；AILayerNorm采用低精度统计计算。实现Softmax和LayerNorm的低精度计算和低比特位宽存储。

Result: SOLE在无需重新训练的情况下保持推理精度，相比GPU实现数量级的速度提升和能耗节省。与现有最先进定制硬件相比，Softmax和LayerNorm分别实现3.04倍、3.86倍的能效改进和2.82倍、3.32倍的面积效率改进。

Conclusion: SOLE通过软硬件协同设计有效解决了Transformer中Softmax和LayerNorm的效率瓶颈，在保持精度的同时显著提升了推理速度和能效。

Abstract: Transformers have shown remarkable performance in both natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, their real-time
inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax
and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function
approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on
computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods
rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly
and inconvenient.
  In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and
LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes
log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate
Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation. Compared
with state-of-the-art designs, we achieve both low-precision calculation and
low bit-width storage on Softmax and LayerNorm. Experiments show that SOLE
maintains inference accuracy without retraining while offering orders of
magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU, achieving 3.04x, 3.86x
energy-efficiency improvements and 2.82x, 3.32x area-efficiency improvements
over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm,
respectively.

Motivation: 高风险高回报任务通常具有多模态动作分布和随机回报特性，而传统强化学习方法假设单峰高斯策略并依赖标量评论家，在这些场景下效果有限。

Method: 将连续动作空间离散化以近似多模态分布，采用熵正则化探索提高风险但高回报动作的覆盖度，引入双评论家架构进行更准确的离散值分布估计。

Conclusion: 该框架能够扩展到高维动作空间，支持复杂控制领域，为处理高风险高回报任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle
crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns.
Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and
rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR
settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian
policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous
action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs
entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding
actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate
discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to
high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments
on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure
demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance
of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

Abstract: Driver identification has become an area of increasing interest in recent
years, especially for data- driven applications, because biometric-based
technologies may incur privacy issues. This study proposes a deep learning
neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an
attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters
than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages
for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering
unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical
network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies
few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model
generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can
identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different
datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it
significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc
identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to
address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers.
The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy
of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario. The second experiment showed that P-AttEnc,
in the 1-shot scenario, can classify unknown drivers with an average accuracy
of 65.7%.

Conclusion: ADCMs框架为一致性模型提供了自动且自适应的离散化方案，解决了手动调整的局限性，提升了模型的实用性和效率。

Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have shown promise for efficient one-step
generation. However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization
schemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and
datasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and
adaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with
respect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training
process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to
ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global
consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising
error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and
global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we
achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer
to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly
improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative
performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Moreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants. Code

LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual
rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.

*Qingyao Ai,Yichen Tang,Changyue Wang,Jianming Long,Weihang Su,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个用户反馈模拟框架和综合基准测试，用于评估LLM系统的持续学习能力，发现现有方法的有效性远未达到满意水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量数据逐渐耗尽和计算资源边际收益递减，传统的数据、参数和测试时计算扩展方法已接近上限，需要借鉴人类和传统AI系统从实践中学习的能力。

Method: 设计用户反馈模拟框架和覆盖多领域、多语言、多任务类型的综合基准测试，评估LLM系统在服务时间中从累积用户反馈学习的能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有最先进基线的有效性和效率远未达到满意水平。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来LLM记忆和优化算法的研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the
mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are
almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal
gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the
abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice,
constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an
important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing
benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous
reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their
abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore,
we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark
covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the
continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness
and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we
hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and
optimization algorithms.

### [459] [Symmetries in PAC-Bayesian Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17303)
*Armin Beck,Peter Ochs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了机器学习中对称性的泛化保证，从紧致群对称性扩展到非紧致对称性（如平移），并放宽了数据分布不变性的假设。基于PAC-Bayes框架，作者改进了现有边界，并在旋转MNIST数据集上验证了理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论主要关注紧致群对称性，且假设数据分布本身具有不变性，这在现实应用中很少满足。作者希望将泛化保证扩展到更广泛的非紧致对称性和非不变数据分布场景。

Method: 基于PAC-Bayes框架，作者改进并收紧现有边界，特别以McAllester的PAC-Bayes边界为例，展示了该方法适用于广泛的PAC-Bayes边界。

Result: 在非均匀旋转群的旋转MNIST数据集上，推导出的保证不仅成立，而且优于先前结果。

Conclusion: 对于对称数据，对称模型在超越紧致群和不变分布狭窄设置的情况下更优，这为更普遍理解机器学习中的对称性开辟了道路。

Abstract: Symmetries are known to improve the empirical performance of machine learning
models, yet theoretical guarantees explaining these gains remain limited. Prior
work has focused mainly on compact group symmetries and often assumes that the
data distribution itself is invariant, an assumption rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. In this work, we extend generalization guarantees to
the broader setting of non-compact symmetries, such as translations and to
non-invariant data distributions. Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt
and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's
PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes
bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with
a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but
also improve upon prior results. These findings provide theoretical evidence
that, for symmetric data, symmetric models are preferable beyond the narrow
setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, opening the way to a
more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning.

Motivation: 现实世界数据涉及多个相互作用的语义因子，但先前工作主要关注简单的双因子静态和动态设置，忽略了数据的多因子本质。

Result: Koopman启发的模型取得了最先进的结果，视觉语言模型能够有效自动化数据集标注和评估，无需人工标签和干预。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为推进多因子序列解缠结提供了稳健且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets
and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer
transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization,
creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these
limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption:
\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant
generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables
remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality,
query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided
\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these
granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an
\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an
interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance.
Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our
method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized,
fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and
data-efficient path for reward modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM在可解释性和性能之间的权衡问题，为需要透明度和能力的监管领域提供支持。

Method: 使用局部性调节参数、信息论招募机制和层次化招募框架，通过组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入实现。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释和高性能模式之间连续插值，同时在多个粒度上适应架构容量。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity
architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on
attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule
injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood
with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing
explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on
semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on
attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism
provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,
within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the
system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data
encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously
interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting
architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in
regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

Motivation: 研究图神经网络中的不变性行为，探索人工神经网络与人类大脑在不变性机制上的差异。

Method: 引入metamers生成技术，通过优化输入图使其内部节点激活与参考图匹配，获得在模型表示空间中等效但结构和节点特征不同的图。

Result: 发现多个经典GNN架构存在极端水平的表示不变性，虽然架构修改和训练策略能部分缓解过度不变性，但无法从根本上缩小与人类不变性的差距。

Conclusion: 量化了metamer图与原始图的偏差，揭示了当前GNNs的独特失效模式，为模型评估提供了补充基准。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in
perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to
emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies
in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain
between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of
humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks
(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing
input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a
reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's
representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node
features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer
dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the
metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of
representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although
targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can
partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge
the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between
metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes
of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

Result: 在原始环境所用时间的一小部分内达到收敛结果。

Conclusion: PINNs替代模型能有效解决强化学习在智能电网优化中的样本效率问题，显著加速训练过程。

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents
significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems
and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of
Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively
throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means
obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a
sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by
substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using
Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training
process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by
the original environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OOD检测方法将分布偏移压缩为单一标量异常分数，无法区分不同类型的OOD数据，限制了后续处理策略的选择。

Method: 利用扩散模型的迭代去噪过程，提取跨多个噪声级别的多维特征向量来捕捉统计差异。

Result: 在图像和表格数据基准测试中，DISC在OOD检测性能上达到或超越现有方法，并能有效分类OOD类型。

Conclusion: DISC实现了从简单二元OOD检测向更细粒度检测的转变，为OOD数据的上下文理解和后续利用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be
it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere
detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the
type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not
distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse
distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that
scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly
contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the
introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC
leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a
rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies
across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular
benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for
OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely
absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary
OOD detection to a more granular detection.

Method: 通过模型架构的详细分析和针对性的实验设置，干预层间表征，展示扩散模型如何分散表征负担。

Result: 扩散模型将表征负担分散到多个层中，挑战了统一内部空间的假设，表明生成过程是专门化过程的涌现配置。

Conclusion: 生成AI应被理解为专门化过程的涌现配置，而非内容的直接合成，这要求重新定位对生成AI的理解方式。

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格预测方法（如梯度提升树和专用深度学习模型）缺乏可解释性和跨任务迁移能力，而推理LLM虽然具备透明推理轨迹和跨任务适应性，但在表格数据上的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出TabR1模型，核心是PRPO（排列相对策略优化）强化学习方法，通过构建多个标签保持的列排列样本，在排列内和跨排列间估计优势函数，将稀疏奖励转化为密集学习信号。

Result: TabR1在全监督微调下达到与强基线相当的性能；在零样本设置下接近32样本设置的强基线性能；TabR1（8B）在各种任务上显著超越更大的LLM，相比DeepSeek-R1（685B）提升高达53.17%。

Conclusion: PRPO方法成功激活了LLM在表格预测中的推理能力，显著提升了少样本和零样本性能以及可解释性，证明了推理LLM在表格预测任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision
trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but
provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning
large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent
reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular
data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction
with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy
Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that
encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing
multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages
both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense
learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO
activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing
few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong
baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1
approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.
Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various
tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

Motivation: 现有随机化bandit算法通常存在次优的后悔界（如$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$），且依赖参数采样导致计算效率低，难以扩展到非参数或神经网络模型。

Method: 特征扰动技术：直接向特征输入注入随机性，而不是随机化未知参数或向奖励添加噪声。这种方法避免了参数采样。

Result: 在广义线性bandit中实现了$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$的最坏情况后悔界，超越了现有方法的性能，并保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 特征扰动技术统一了强大的实际性能与最佳理论保证，计算高效且自然扩展到非参数或神经网络模型。

Abstract: We propose feature perturbation, a simple yet powerful technique that injects
randomness directly into feature inputs, instead of randomizing unknown
parameters or adding noise to rewards. Remarkably, this algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret bound for generalized linear
bandits, while avoiding the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret
typical of existing randomized bandit algorithms. Because our algorithm eschews
parameter sampling, it is both computationally efficient and naturally extends
to non-parametric or neural network models. We verify these advantages through
empirical evaluations, demonstrating that feature perturbation not only
surpasses existing methods but also unifies strong practical performance with
best-known theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: 锚定机制是实现平均奖励离线强化学习有限时间分析的关键，该方法在更宽松的弱通信MDP假设下有效

Abstract: Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample
complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior
work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention,
and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or
linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity
results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly
communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce
Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration
with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as
a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the
average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup
where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID
transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.

Motivation: 多模态神经网络训练常受模态过拟合困扰，即网络过度依赖某一模态，导致性能次优且相对单模态模型改进有限

Conclusion: 平衡多模态学习对提升模型性能具有重要影响，MILES方法能有效解决模态过拟合问题

Abstract: The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources,
referred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying
on a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically
hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one
of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,
hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal
improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the
Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint
fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in
modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively
balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during
training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal
model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal
predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion
tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion
methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during
training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality
encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent
modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal
learning on improving model performance.

Conclusion: RINS-T提供了一个灵活有效的框架，通过创新的优化技术解决了时间序列逆问题中的鲁棒性和稳定性挑战。

Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as
missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for
tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues,
inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted
data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require
extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In
this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series
Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high
recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages
neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization
techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on
Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and
robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,
input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these
contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and
robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution
for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了心律失常检测算法向时间感知范式的转变，为ECG解释特别是复杂心律失常如房颤和房扑开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with
continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and
pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven
challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local
waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal
resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a
novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for
multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions
significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC,
with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998,
demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced
out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal
temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This
work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia
detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in
particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CDUA的新方法，结合特征工程和深度学习来准确预测锂离子电池容量及其不确定性，在真实车辆数据上实现了0.94%的相对MAE和1.14%的相对RMSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锂离子电池容量及其不确定性的准确预测对于可靠的电池管理至关重要，但由于老化的随机性，这仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用基于扩散的生成模型进行时间序列预测，结合注意力机制。首先从真实车辆运行数据中提取电池容量，然后使用Pearson相关系数和XGBoost算法识别最相关特征，最后训练CDUA模型（包含带自注意力的上下文U-Net和去噪网络）。

Result: 在真实车辆数据上的实验验证显示，CDUA模型实现了0.94%的相对MAE和1.14%的相对RMSE，95%置信区间的相对宽度为3.74%。

Conclusion: CDUA能够提供准确的容量估计和可靠的不确定性量化，比较实验进一步验证了其相对于现有主流方法的鲁棒性和优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated
uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains
challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel
method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which
integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The
proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series
forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive
performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle
operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are
used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a
contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,
and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy
observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data
demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,
with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results
confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable
uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its
robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.

Method: 通过Mercer核量化合成数据与真实数据在特征空间的相似度，将该先验作为指导引入反向扩散过程。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模数据集上的实验表明，DAP在生成高保真数据集和跨架构泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 建立了扩散先验与数据集蒸馏目标的理论联系，提供了无需训练的实用框架来提升蒸馏数据集质量。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from
large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of
diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled
dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful
diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness
prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often
necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To
address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes
representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real
data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as
guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the
representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive
experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets,
demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating
high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture
generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between
diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a
practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled
dataset.

TL;DR: 提出GBN网络，通过局部瓶颈调整解决MPNN中的过平滑和过压缩问题，在深度超过256层时仍保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPNN存在过平滑和过压缩问题，现有全局方法在某些区域有益但在其他区域有害，导致表达能力不足

Method: 连接局部黎曼几何与MPNN，建立非齐次边界条件，基于Robin条件设计具有局部瓶颈调整的GBN网络

Result: 在同质性和异质性图上的实验显示GBN具有强大表达能力，深度超过256层时性能不下降

Conclusion: GBN通过局部方法有效解决过压缩和过平滑问题，在深度网络中保持稳定性能

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph
foundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both
issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be
beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the
suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing
through a global measure -- spectral gap $\lambda$ -- and prove that the
increase of $\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input
features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated
by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that
adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,
we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel
nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with
local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive
experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of
GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the
network depth exceeds $256$ layers.

Motivation: 深度神经网络如PhaseNet在微地震事件检测中精度高，但其黑盒特性在关键应用中存在担忧，需要提高模型可靠性和可解释性。

Method: 使用Grad-CAM和SHAP解释PhaseNet模型决策；开发SHAP门控推理方案，结合模型输出和基于解释的指标来减少错误。

Result: Grad-CAM显示网络注意力与P波和S波到达时间一致；SHAP量化特征贡献，确认垂直分量驱动P相位拾取，水平分量主导S相位拾取；SHAP门控模型F1分数0.98(精度0.99，召回率0.97)，优于基准PhaseNet(F1 0.97)，对噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI不仅能解释深度学习模型，还能直接提升其性能，为构建可信的自动化地震检测器提供了模板。

Abstract: Deep neural networks like PhaseNet show high accuracy in detecting
microseismic events, but their black-box nature is a concern in critical
applications. We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve
its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with
P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming
that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal
components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that
combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors.
On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of
0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet
(F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results
show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly
enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated
seismic detectors.

Motivation: 当前ECG生物认证研究主要关注静息状态，但静息-运动场景下的性能下降问题尚未解决，需要开发能够适应不同生理状态的鲁棒认证模型。

Method: 结合多尺度深度卷积特征提取和注意力机制，专门针对跨状态（静息-运动）条件设计，确保在不同生理状态下具有强识别能力。

Result: 在运动-ECGID数据集上，静息到运动场景准确率92.50%，运动到静息场景94.72%，静息到静息场景99.94%，混合到混合场景97.85%。在ECG-ID和MIT-BIH数据集上的验证进一步证实了泛化能力。

Conclusion: CrossStateECG展示了在动态现实环境中作为运动后ECG认证实用解决方案的潜力，能够有效处理静息-运动跨状态条件下的生物认证挑战。

Abstract: Current research in Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics mainly emphasizes
resting-state conditions, leaving the performance decline in rest-exercise
scenarios largely unresolved. This paper introduces CrossStateECG, a robust
ECG-based authentication model explicitly tailored for cross-state
(rest-exercise) conditions. The proposed model creatively combines multi-scale
deep convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to ensure
strong identification across different physiological states. Experimental
results on the exercise-ECGID dataset validate the effectiveness of
CrossStateECG, achieving an identification accuracy of 92.50% in the
Rest-to-Exercise scenario (training on resting ECG and testing on post-exercise
ECG) and 94.72% in the Exercise-to-Rest scenario (training on post-exercise ECG
and testing on resting ECG). Furthermore, CrossStateECG demonstrates
exceptional performance across both state combinations, reaching an accuracy of
99.94% in Rest-to-Rest scenarios and 97.85% in Mixed-to-Mixed scenarios.
Additional validations on the ECG-ID and MIT-BIH datasets further confirmed the
generalization abilities of CrossStateECG, underscoring its potential as a
practical solution for post-exercise ECG-based authentication in dynamic
real-world settings.

TL;DR: Transformers通过训练发展出模块化、可解释的机制来支持组合推理，其内部算法结构与行为表现相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在未观察序列上的组合推理能力，探索其内部机制如何支持这种能力。

Method: 使用随机层次模型(RHM)生成序列，在序列子集上训练模型，评估四种泛化条件，并通过主成分分析和注意力模式聚类分析内部表示。

Result: 性能随任务复杂性和上下文示例数量系统提升，跨分布任务需要更多示例；训练中出现层次专业化，形成结构化、层次化组织的表示。

Conclusion: Transformer发展出模块化、可解释的机制支持组合推理，内部算法结构与行为能力相关。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

TL;DR: ZACH-ViT是一种轻量级视觉变换器，用于区分心源性肺水肿与非心源性肺部疾病，在肺超声视频分类中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于非心源性炎症模式、间质性肺病和健康肺部的视觉变异性高，传统方法难以准确区分心源性肺水肿与其他肺部状况。

Method: 提出ZACH-ViT（零标记自适应紧凑分层视觉变换器），移除位置嵌入和[CLS]标记，使其完全置换不变；采用ShuffleStrides数据增强技术增强泛化能力。

Result: 在380个肺超声视频上评估，ZACH-ViT获得最高验证和测试ROC-AUC（0.80和0.79），平衡灵敏度（0.60）和特异性（0.91），训练速度比最小ViT快1.35倍。

Conclusion: 将架构设计与数据结构对齐可以在小数据医学成像中超越规模效应，支持实时临床部署。

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.

Conclusion: DAMSDAN框架通过动态源加权和细粒度语义对齐，有效提升了跨域EEG情绪识别的性能，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of
EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core
challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional
heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to
reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency
to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware
multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates
prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder
toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware
source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically
estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition,
a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label
interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level,
fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift.
Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\%
for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the
large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive
ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

Motivation: 地下决策面临高成本和不确定性，将地质知识直接嵌入预测模型是获取新数据的替代方案。过程模型可以帮助训练生成模型以提高预测效率。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)生成河流沉积物，并尝试四种反演方法来匹配井数据和地震数据。通过标签条件化、潜在空间过参数化和微调来改善潜在空间结构。

Result: 四种反演方法在4、8、20口井的三个测试样本中难以匹配井数据，特别是当井数增加或测试样本与训练数据差异较大时。微调GAN可以显著降低不匹配度，但依赖于初始部分成功的反演步骤。

Conclusion: GANs已具备集成到地质建模工作流中的能力，但仍需进一步评估其鲁棒性，以及如何最好地利用它们支持地质解释。

Abstract: High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as
acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly
into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables
just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train
generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning
algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be
inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to
three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,
especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the
training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it
is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not
necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent
overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during
training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning
the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to
acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this
approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which
influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can
already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling
workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best
leverage them in support of geological interpretation.

Conclusion: 基于矩阵分解的隐私计算方法能够为去中心化学习提供更严格的隐私保证，并为开发新的DP-DL算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors
in a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability
and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy
guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with
results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across
peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility
trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to
limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show
that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization
(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By
generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL
algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields
tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a
principled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce
MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that
outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.

Conclusion: 局部几何分析框架能够连接优化几何与功能行为，为改进网络架构和训练稳定性提供实用见解。

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for analyzing neural networks through the lens of
layer-wise Hessian matrices. The local Hessian of each functional block (layer)
is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of a scalar function with
respect to the parameters of that layer. This concept provides a formal tool
for characterizing the local geometry of the parameter space. We show that the
spectral properties of local Hessians, such as the distribution of eigenvalues,
reveal quantitative patterns associated with overfitting,
underparameterization, and expressivity in neural network architectures. We
conduct an extensive empirical study involving 111 experiments across 37
datasets. The results demonstrate consistent structural regularities in the
evolution of local Hessians during training and highlight correlations between
their spectra and generalization performance. These findings establish a
foundation for using local geometric analysis to guide the diagnosis and design
of deep neural networks. The proposed framework connects optimization geometry
with functional behavior and offers practical insight for improving network
architectures and training stability.

Abstract: Stochastic difference-of-convex (DC) optimization is prevalent in numerous
machine learning applications, yet its convergence properties under small batch
sizes remain poorly understood. Existing methods typically require large
batches or strong noise assumptions, which limit their practical use. In this
work, we show that momentum enables convergence under standard smoothness and
bounded variance assumptions (of the concave part) for any batch size. We prove
that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize,
highlighting its necessity. Our momentum-based algorithm achieves provable
convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了过参数化最小二乘问题中梯度下降在大学习率下的收敛行为，揭示了在边缘稳定性区域的三种收敛机制：亚临界、临界和超临界状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化理论只保证梯度下降在小步长下的单调收敛，但神经网络训练常使用大学习率，在"边缘稳定性"区域出现非单调下降和向平坦最小值的隐式偏置。本文旨在量化这一现象。

Method: 利用过参数化使全局最小点形成黎曼流形，将梯度下降动态分解为平行和正交于流形的分量。平行分量对应黎曼梯度下降，正交分量是分叉动力系统。

Result: 识别了三种收敛机制：亚临界状态在有限时间内克服瞬时不稳定性后线性收敛；临界状态不稳定性持续存在但以幂律收敛；超临界状态不稳定性持续但线性收敛到周期2轨道。

Conclusion: 通过流形分解方法，为理解梯度下降在大学习率下的收敛行为提供了理论框架，解释了边缘稳定性现象中的不同收敛模式。

Abstract: Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for
gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime.
In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a
large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective
decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima.
In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing
convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an
overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is
that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers
forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD
dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component
corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while
the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows
us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning
rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is
overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global
minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time
with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)
the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with
linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat
global minimum.

Abstract: Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively
remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that
create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are
better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly
understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental
problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph
limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the
infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse
neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as
networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of
different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and
provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon
representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to
study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit.
Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse
networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK
correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the
varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework
provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the
trainability of various sparse network architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了SAFE-D框架，用于检测帕金森病相关的驾驶行为异常，通过多源车辆控制数据构建行为档案，使用注意力网络自适应识别时空特征，在模拟环境中达到96.8%的检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注功能驱动的暂时性异常（如困倦、分心），但缺乏对病理触发异常（特别是慢性疾病如帕金森病）的检测机制，这对公共交通安全构成风险。

Method: 分析帕金森病症状学，建立与驾驶性能退化的因果关系；集成多车辆控制组件数据构建行为档案；设计基于注意力的网络自适应优先处理时空特征。

Result: 在Logitech G29平台和CARLA模拟器上验证，使用三个道路地图模拟真实驾驶，SAFE-D在区分正常和帕金森病影响驾驶模式方面达到96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: SAFE-D框架能有效检测帕金森病相关的驾驶行为异常，为慢性疾病患者的驾驶安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A driver's health state serves as a determinant factor in driving behavioral
regulation. Subtle deviations from normalcy can lead to operational anomalies,
posing risks to public transportation safety. While prior efforts have
developed detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such
as drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed
pathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic
medical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of
Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for
detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our
methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease
symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal
links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral
variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data
from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then
design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal
features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.
Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,
using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show
SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and
Parkinson-affected driving patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签学习中存在长尾不平衡问题：少数头部标签主导梯度信号，而许多实际重要的罕见标签被忽略。

Method: 将标签空间分配给多个合作玩家，共享全局准确率收益，同时根据标签稀有性和玩家间分歧获得额外好奇心奖励，无需手动调整类别权重。

Result: 在传统基准和三个超大规模数据集上实现最先进性能，Rare-F1提升达+4.3%，P@3提升+1.6%，消融实验显示出现分工现象和罕见类别上更快的共识。

Conclusion: CD-GTMLL为多标签预测中的长尾鲁棒性提供了原则性、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels
dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in
practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a
cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label
Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several
cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional
curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement.
These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without
hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a
differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that
tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on
conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent
state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the
strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and
faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable
route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

Motivation: 现有方法如Deep Feature Reweighting依赖显式组标签，面临组标签不可得、组内样本少、多虚假相关导致性能下降等问题。

Method: 通过生成多样反事实样本，让人类标注者高效探索和修正模型决策边界，通过知识蒸馏步骤不仅重加权欠采样组，还丰富新数据点。

Conclusion: CFKD无需混淆变量标签，能扩展到多混淆因素，提供比现有方法更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to
so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale
foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods,
such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to
upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels
are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the
subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple
spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose
Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these
issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to
efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a
knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the
undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method
does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple
confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate
CFKD's efficacy across five datasets, spanning synthetic tasks to an industrial
application, with particularly strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced
spurious correlations. Additionally, we provide an ablation study on the effect
of the chosen counterfactual explainer and teacher model, highlighting their
impact on robustness.

Motivation: 深度学习模型容易在训练中记忆噪声，特别是在低SNR数据中导致泛化性能下降。受标签噪声具有隐式正则化效果的启发，研究是否可以通过引入标签噪声来提升神经网络在低SNR场景下的测试性能。

Method: 采用两层神经网络，在理想化的信号-噪声数据设置中，使用带有标签噪声的梯度下降(GD)算法进行训练。

Result: 标签噪声GD能够抑制噪声记忆，防止噪声主导学习过程，实现快速信号增长同时控制过拟合，从而在低SNR下获得良好泛化性能。相比之下，标准GD容易在相同设置下过拟合噪声。

Conclusion: 在基于梯度的训练中引入标签噪声对低SNR数据具有显著益处，能够有效提升神经网络的泛化能力。

Abstract: The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the
underlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This
noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior
observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves
generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to
the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in
the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a
simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized
signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training
suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning
process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the
overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite
the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends
to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing
lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing
label noise in gradient-based training.

Motivation: 边缘智能需要低延迟推理，但确保可靠性具有挑战性。需要保证边缘预测集在条件覆盖方面与云模型相当。

Method: 将边缘到云的升级建模为多重假设检验问题，使用保形对齐来选择可在边缘安全处理的输入。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类和TeleQnA问答基准测试中，CAb级联保持了目标条件覆盖，同时显著减少了向云的卸载，预测集大小仅适度增加。

Conclusion: CAb级联方法为边缘预测提供了统计保证，在覆盖、延迟率和集大小之间实现了可调权衡。

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models,
but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that
must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set,
it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if
produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to
the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based
(CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over
the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a
multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA)
to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb
model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of
edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure
applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal
prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate,
and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA
question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains
the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially
reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in
prediction-set size.

Conclusion: TrajMamba能够有效解决车辆轨迹学习中的计算负担和冗余点问题，实现高效且语义丰富的轨迹表示学习。

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable
travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning
travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world
applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.
First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in
textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to
modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which
harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address
these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and
semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a
Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS
and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of
continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware
Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings
without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce
redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation
Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask
generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that
TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and
accuracy.

Abstract: Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in
safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid
outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance
remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task
and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing
verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating
time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework
that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37
widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none
satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close
this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all
properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter
requirements.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,
constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be
carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning
provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being
a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially
depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the
trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update
the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in
practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an
automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we
analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe
reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles
that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and
constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly
sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general
intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally
show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even
exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference
in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier
updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated
through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to
achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need
for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement
learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at

Conclusion: 通过降维进一步压缩抗菌肽设计空间可以提高优化效率、增强可解释性，并能有效利用理化特性信息来组织潜在空间。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.

Conclusion: CEPerFed通过协调本地和全局优化以及减少通信开销，有效解决了联邦学习在医疗MRI分类中的数据异构性和通信效率问题。

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical
practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for
multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various
medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing
across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to
address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect
of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large
numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these
challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL
method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating
client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to
coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the
contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,
while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global
optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data
distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a
hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical
information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be
released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明这些模型在自杀预测中具有有效性，GAN在生成合成数据以支持自杀预防建模工作中发挥了关键作用。

Abstract: Suicide prediction is the key for prevention, but real data with sufficient
positive samples is rare and causes extreme class imbalance. We utilized
machine learning (ML) to build the model and deep learning (DL) techniques,
like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to generate synthetic data samples
to enhance the dataset. The initial dataset contained 656 samples, with only
four positive cases, prompting the need for data augmentation. A variety of
machine learning models, ranging from interpretable data models to black box
algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR)
achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a
weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99,
respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86.
LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and
misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 &
0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0)

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by
detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot
performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often
compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical
downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish
between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their
embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user
goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.
To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad
generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot
classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate
high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high
precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of
user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery
annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning
strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME
identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision
boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample
diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without
costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then
a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our
method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,
establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting
foundation models to specific user needs.

Conclusion: 论文为多模型不确定性和风险规避强化学习提供了理论框架和实用算法，填补了传统动态规划与策略梯度方法之间的空白，并解决了风险敏感场景下的策略优化问题。

Abstract: This dissertation makes three main contributions. First, We identify a new
connection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose
the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov
policy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.
CADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy
improvements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and
prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC
and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,
and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for
ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for
computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The
challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we
use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous
proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the
optimal risk-averse value functions. The proposed Q-learning algorithms compute
the optimal stationary policy for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

Motivation: 当前Sim2Real RL方法通过优化仿真器精度和变异性作为真实世界性能的代理指标，但这些指标与策略在真实世界中的性能不一定相关。

Method: 采用双层次RL框架：内层RL在仿真中训练策略，外层RL调整仿真模型和仿真内奖励参数，以最大化仿真策略在真实世界中的性能。

Result: 在简单示例中推导并验证了开发双层次RL算法所需的数学工具。

Conclusion: 该框架能够直接基于真实世界性能优化仿真器参数，有效解决Sim2Real性能差距问题。

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments
and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments
of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely
in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real
environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current
Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies
for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate
with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and
empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this
issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world
performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level
RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the
simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world
performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the
mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the
Sim2Real performance gap.

Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible
alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled
data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision
making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints
on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with
black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output
cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,
preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this
paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently
improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,
we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs
and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative
verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,
uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that
they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing
performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient
approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available
operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating
points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark
methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了物理信息神经网络(PINN)策略，将海冰物理知识整合到机器学习模型中，用于预测北极海冰速度和浓度，相比纯数据驱动模型在样本较少时表现更好。

Motivation: 随着北极海冰进入新阶段(冰层变薄、融化加速)，纯数据驱动的机器学习模型在泛化性和物理一致性方面存在局限，无法充分表示未来动态变化的海冰条件。

Method: 基于分层信息共享U-net架构，引入物理损失函数和激活函数，将海冰物理知识整合到神经网络中，生成物理上合理的海冰速度和浓度输出。

Result: PINN模型在海冰速度和浓度的日预测中优于纯数据驱动模型，特别是在融化期和早期冻结期以及快速移动冰区附近，SIC预测得到显著改善。

Conclusion: 物理信息神经网络方法能够有效提升海冰预测的准确性和物理一致性，在训练样本较少时仍能保持良好性能。

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis, current manifold-learning
methods do not support machine learning directly on the latent $d$-dimensional
data manifold, as they primarily aim to perform dimensionality reduction into
$\mathbb{R}^D$, losing key manifold features when the embedding dimension $D$
approaches $d$.
  On the other hand, methods that directly learn the latent manifold as a
differentiable atlas have been relatively underexplored.
  In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and
potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data
structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian
optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised
heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We
experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of
efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised
classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of
hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of
our approach.

Result: 在图像生成和蛋白质生成任务上，样本质量随推理计算增加而持续提升，证明了该方法在科学领域的适用性。

Conclusion: 流匹配模型的推理时计算扩展可以应用于科学领域，且能在保持高效采样的同时提升样本质量。

Abstract: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.

Abstract: Modern probabilistic regressors often remain overconfident under distribution
shift. We present Functional Distribution Networks (FDN), an input-conditioned
distribution over network weights that induces predictive mixtures whose
dispersion adapts to the input. FDN is trained with a beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo
sampling. We further propose an evaluation protocol that cleanly separates
interpolation from extrapolation and stresses OOD sanity checks (e.g., that
predictive likelihood degrades under shift while in-distribution accuracy and
calibration are maintained). On standard regression tasks, we benchmark against
strong Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched
parameter and update budgets, and assess accuracy, calibration, and
shift-awareness with standard diagnostics. Together, the framework and protocol
aim to make OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression practical and modular.

Motivation: 解决现有低秩投影方法（如GaLore）缺乏收敛保证和存在固有偏差的问题，这些偏差导致与完整参数训练存在性能差距。

Method: 基于GaLore机制和Muon算法，采用层间采样技术来消除低秩投影的偏差，开发了GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM)方法。

Result: 理论证明GUM方法匹配Muon算法的收敛保证，同时保持低秩技术的内存效率。实验显示在LLM微调和预训练中优于GaLore，甚至超过完整参数训练。

Conclusion: 该技术通过更均匀的层内知识分布，实现了模型参数空间的更高效利用和更好的记忆能力，为内存高效的大语言模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large
language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank
projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a
representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is
their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches
introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,
which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.
Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling
technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an
instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank
optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named
GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the
convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory
efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and
pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even
better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows
that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution
of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model
parameter space and better memorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究沥青在输送管道中的分离问题，特别是在煤颗粒和微气泡存在的情况下，旨在开发提高沥青分离效率的创新策略。

Method: 通过实验研究煤颗粒和H2O2分解产生的微气泡对沥青回收的影响，并采用计算流体动力学(CFD)模拟分析管道内沥青的分布情况。

Result: 煤颗粒单独存在时使沥青回收率降低17%；H2O2单独作用效果有限；但煤颗粒与H2O2共同作用显著提高回收效率，且H2O2用量越大效果越好。CFD模拟显示煤颗粒导致沥青在管道中部聚集，微气泡促进沥青向顶部分布。

Conclusion: 煤颗粒和微气泡的协同作用能显著提高沥青分离效率，这为开发水力输送过程中沥青分离的创新策略提供了重要见解，并深化了对气泡、沥青和煤颗粒在浆料流中复杂相互作用的理解。

Abstract: Our study investigates the segregation of bitumen residues within the
transport pipeline before disposal in the presence of coal particles in
carriers and microbubbles. Coal particles decreased the bitumen recovery by 17%
without the injection of microbubbles. In addition, the improvement in bitumen
recovery efficiency by 6 mL of H2O2 is negligible due to a small number of
bubbles formed from H2O2 decomposition in the flow. However, tremendous
enhancement in the recovery efficiency was achieved with the simultaneous
addition of coal particles and H2O2. Further increase in recovery was noted as
a larger volume of H2O2 was injected to form more microbubbles. Computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to help understand the effects
of coal particles and microbubbles. The simulation results illustrated that the
introduction of coal particles caused bitumen contents to accumulate in the
middle of the pipe. Furthermore, an increased volume fraction of microbubbles
contributed to a higher distribution of bitumen at the top of the pipe. This
study not only offers valuable insights for developing an innovative strategy
to enhance the efficiency of bitumen separation in hydrotransport processes but
also contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions among
bubbles, bitumen, and coal particles in a slurry flow.

Abstract: The massive volume of oil sands tailings has been one of the most challenging
environmental issues. In this work, we experimentally explore a simple and
effective approach to bitumen residue separation from a highly concentrated
slurry flow of the artificial oil sands tailings. By utilizing microbubbles
from in-situ catalytic decomposition of H2O2 at low concentrations, bitumen
aggregation is enhanced on the top part of the hydrotransport pipeline. The
microscopic image analysis revealed the in-situ formation of microbubbles and
confirmed that magnetic particles present in the slurries contributed to the
fast release of the gas products and bubble formation from hydrogen peroxide
decomposition. A high-speed camera was applied to capture images of the
tailings flow in the pipeline through a transparent view window. A large number
of tiny bubbles were identified post to the injection of H2O2 to the slurry
flow. More than 70 % bitumen could be recovered from a lab-scale pipeline loop
within 30 mins after injection. The bitumen recovery efficiency from the
collected froth was quantitatively compared under seven conditions with varied
dosages, the concentration of H2O2, and the amount of magnetic solids in the
slurries. Our results confirmed that the total dosage of H2O2 is the dominant
factor in in-situ microbubble formation for enhanced bitumen aggregation in the
flow. Importantly, microbubbles were generated rapidly in the real mature fine
tailings. The results from our study provide insights into the preferential
distribution of oil residue in the flow during hydrotransport without the
requirement for an additional device. Removal of oily residues from
concentrated slurries may bring economical and environmental advantages.

### [511] [Mechanism generating reverse buoyancy flux at the small scales of stably stratified turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16176)
*Soumak Bhattacharjee,Stephen M. de Bruyn Kops,Andrew D. Bragg*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 该研究分析了稳定分层湍流中尺度相关的浮力通量反转现象，揭示了这种反转与Bragg & de Bruyn Kops发现的机制相关，该机制解释了为什么湍流动能耗散率随Prandtl数增加而增加，而湍流势能耗散率却减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明，在稳定分层湍流的小尺度上，尺度相关的浮力通量会反转符号，即湍流势能（TPE）在这些尺度上重新转化为湍流动能（TKE），且这种反向通量的大小随Prandtl数增加而增强。

Method: 使用滤波分析从理论上证明这种通量反转与Bragg & de Bruyn Kops识别的机制相关，该机制与密度场中斜坡-悬崖结构的形成有关。通过3D统计稳态强分层湍流的直接数值模拟（DNS）验证理论分析。

Result: DNS模拟证实了理论分析，表明虽然局部贡献平均上只在最小尺度主导浮力通量，但在所有尺度上仍与浮力通量强相关。斜坡结构在小尺度上仅贡献反向浮力通量事件，而悬崖结构则同时贡献正向和反向浮力通量事件。

Conclusion: 斜坡-悬崖结构不仅与局部浮力通量反转相关，也与非局部部分相关。在小尺度（约低于Ozmidov尺度），斜坡结构专门贡献反向浮力通量事件，而悬崖结构则贡献正向和反向浮力通量事件。

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that at the small-scales of stably stratified
turbulence, the scale-dependent buoyancy flux reverses sign, such that there is
a conversion of turbulent potential energy (TPE) back into turbulent kinetic
energy (TKE) at these scales. Moreover, the magnitude of the reverse flux
becomes stronger with increasing Prandtl number $Pr$. Using a filtering
analysis we demonstrate analytically how this flux reversal is connected to the
mechanism identified in Bragg \& de Bruyn Kops (JFM 2024 Vol 991 A10) that is
responsible for the surprising observation that the TKE dissipation rate
increases while the TPE dissipation rate decreases with increasing $Pr$ in
stratified turbulence. The mechanism identified by Bragg \& de Bruyn Kops,
which is connected to the formation of ramp-cliff structures in the density
field, is shown to give the scale-local contribution to the buoyancy flux. At
the smallest-scales this local contribution dominates and explains the flux
reversal, while at larger scales a non-local contribution is important. Direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of 3D statistically stationary, stably stratified
turbulence in the strongly stratified regime confirm the theoretical analysis,
and indicate that while on average the local contribution only dominates the
buoyancy flux at the smallest scales, it remains strongly correlated with the
buoyancy flux at all scales. The results show that ramp-cliffs are not only
connected to the reversal of the local buoyancy flux but also the non-local
part. At the small scales (approximately below the Ozmidov scale), ramp
structures contribute exclusively to reverse buoyancy flux events, whereas
cliff structures contribute to both forward and reverse buoyancy flux events.

Motivation: 研究湍流边界层在经历复杂压力梯度历史后的恢复机制，探索历史效应对边界层行为的影响。

Method: 采用热线风速仪测量，在恢复区域多个下游站位获取数据，基于匹配的摩擦雷诺数和Clauser压力梯度参数进行对比分析。

Result: 增强的压力梯度历史强度会增强平均速度剖面的尾流，放大整个边界层的湍流强度，外层区域的湍流保留持久的历史影响，恢复后的VLSM流向长度缩短。

Conclusion: 湍流边界层即使在匹配的局部参数下也保留上游历史的清晰印记，尺度相互作用在复杂压力梯度历史后的恢复机制中起核心作用。

Abstract: The present study experimentally investigates the recovery of smooth-wall
turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) following non-equilibrium pressure gradients
(PGs). The imposed pressure gradient history (PGH) comprises favourable-adverse
pressure gradient (FAPG) sequences of varying strength, followed by recovery to
zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) conditions. Hot-wire anemometry measurements were
obtained at multiple downstream stations in the recovery region, with friction
Reynolds numbers $Re_\tau$ ranging from 2000 to 6000 depending on downstream
development. Comparative analysis at matched $Re_\tau$ and Clauser pressure
gradient parameter $\beta$ enables clear assessment of history effects on TBL
behaviour. Results show that increasing PGH strength enhances the wake in mean
velocity profiles and amplifies turbulence intensities across the boundary
layer, including the inner peak, logarithmic region, and outer peak (a
signature of APG). Downstream, the mean flow gradually recovers toward a
ZPG-like state, but turbulence in the outer region retains a lasting impact of
PGH. Spectral analysis indicates that PGH primarily affects outer-layer scales,
introducing a distinct PG peak and modifying the VLSM peak - with energy
amplification dependent on PGH strength and spatial characteristics governed by
history effects. Downstream recovery involves merging of large-scale
wavelengths and the reorganisation of turbulence structures toward a ZPG-like
state - although the `recovered' VLSM streamwise length becomes shortened due
to the mixing of lengthscales with the PG peak. These results demonstrate that
even under matched local parameters, TBLs retain a clear imprint of their
upstream history, consistent with the findings of Preskett et al. (2025);
moreover, this study provides new insights regarding the central role of scale
interactions in the recovery mechanism of TBL subjected to complex PGH.

Method: 使用LaSDI算法构建降阶模型，基于材料状态方程参数和初始条件，利用后期部分观测数据，通过训练自编码器进行非线性变换。

Result: 模型不仅提供了高效的动态代理模型，还揭示了RMI在非线性变换后表现出低维线性动力学系统结构，即使进入非线性增长阶段。

Conclusion: 该降阶模型对处理RMI的下游工程任务具有实用价值，其低维表示为理论研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Efficient modeling of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is essential to
many engineering tasks, including high-speed combustion and drive and capsule
geometry optimization in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In the latter, RMI
causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and
lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In
this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on
the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution
space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS
parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only
late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not
only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the
RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear
dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear
transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a
trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental
parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering
tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests
a new direction for theoretical work.

### [514] [State estimation in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using super-resolution with a 4DVar training algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16904)
*Markus Weyrauch,Moritz Linkmann,Jacob Page*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 将4DVar数据同化算法用于训练神经网络进行三维各向同性湍流的超分辨率重建，无需高分辨率参考数据。通过结合可微分JAX-CFD求解器和卷积神经网络，在损失函数中包含整个轨迹，实现了优于传统4DVar的状态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分数据同化和基于机器学习的超分辨率是湍流状态估计的两种方法。前者需要粗分辨率观测时间序列，后者通常需要高分辨率真实数据。本研究旨在探索无需高分辨率参考数据即可训练神经网络进行超分辨率重建的方法。

Method: 采用完全可微分的JAX-CFD求解器（适应三维流动）与卷积神经网络结合，将整个轨迹纳入损失函数，通过基于梯度的优化定义神经网络权重。还提出了混合方法，用训练好的神经网络输出初始化4DVar。

Result: 得到的神经网络在初始时间状态估计方面优于4DVar，但4DVar在接近同化窗口末端时预测更稳健。混合方法在所有时间点的性能比其他状态估计策略准确两倍以上，即使在已知限制长度尺度之外也表现良好。

Conclusion: 成功展示了4DVar算法可用于训练无需高分辨率参考数据的神经网络进行超分辨率重建，混合方法显著提高了状态估计精度，且不依赖任何高分辨率测量数据。

Abstract: Variational data assimilation and machine-learning based super-resolution are
two alternative approaches to state estimation in turbulent flows. The former
is an optimisation problem featuring a time series of coarse observations, the
latter usually requires a library of high-resolution 'ground truth' data. We
show that the classic '4DVar' data assimilation algorithm can be used to train
neural networks for super-resolution in three-dimensional isotropic turbulence
without the need for high-resolution reference data. To do this, we adapt a
pseudo-spectral version of the fully-differentiable JAX-CFD solver (Kochkov et
al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 118, 2021) to three-dimensional flows and combine it
with a convolutional neural network for super-resolution. As a result we are
able to include entire trajectories in our loss function which is minimised
with gradient-based optimisation to define the neural network weights. We show
that the resulting neural networks outperform 4DVar for state estimation at
initial time over a wide variety of metrics, though 4DVar leads to more robust
predictions towards the end of its assimilation window. We also present a
hybrid approach in which the trained neural network output is used to
initialise 4DVar. The resulting performance is more than twice as accurate as
other state estimation strategies for all times and performs well even beyond
known limiting lengthscales, all without requiring access to high-resolution
measurements at any point.

*Pierre Coulombel,Fabian Denner*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出了瞬态压力场中空化起始的精确定义，连接准静态和动态机制，将空化定义为气泡半径向动态不稳定状态的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知液体在张力下会发生空化，但瞬态压力场中空化起始的普遍接受标准尚不存在。

Method: 通过结合适当的无量纲参数，建立自相似的空化起始描述，识别气泡半径向动态不稳定状态的转变作为空化阈值。

Result: 不同液体的相图揭示了空化起始所需的最小张力，由张力事件持续时间和初始气泡尺寸决定，Blake阈值是所有条件下空化的下界。

Conclusion: 提出的临界张力定义统一了准静态和动态机制，为瞬态压力场中的空化起始提供了精确的判定标准。

Abstract: While it is well known that cavitation occurs in liquids under tension, no
universally accepted criterion for its onset in transient pressure fields
exists. We propose a precise definition of the critical tension for cavitation
in transient pressure fields that bridges the gap between quasi-static and
dynamic regimes, identifying cavitation as the transition of the bubble radius
to a dynamically unstable state. This threshold depends on the instantaneous
state of the gas-liquid system and, when combined with an appropriate set of
dimensionless parameters, yields a self-similar description of cavitation
onset. Phase maps for different liquids reveal a minimum tension required for
the onset of cavitation, determined by the duration of the tension event and
the initial bubble size, whereby the well-known Blake threshold is the lower
bound for cavitation across all conditions.

*K. Chand,Cheng-Nian Xiao,Inanc Senocak*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 通过直接数值模拟研究常定环境分层和地表冷却维持的稳定大气边界层，揭示了分层机制和强度对湍流的影响，识别了不同稳定度状态，并分析了热力结构和能量传输特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究环境分层主导的稳定大气边界层中湍流维持机制，探索分层参数对湍流特性的影响，为改进参数化方案提供理论基础。

Method: 采用直接数值模拟(DNS)方法，在四维参数空间(分层扰动参数Πs、风强迫参数Πw、罗斯比半径因子Πf、普朗特数)中分析长寿命稳定大气边界层。

Result: 识别了线性稳定、非常稳定和弱稳定三种状态；发现弱稳定状态下存在持续湍流；热力结构呈现多层特征；湍流动能对分层依赖弱，而浮力和湍流势能对分层敏感；湍流普朗特数呈现强烈垂直变化。

Conclusion: 稳定大气边界层的湍流维持具有多参数依赖性，环境分层主导的SABLs需要改进的参数化方案，特别是要考虑湍流普朗特数的垂直变化和各向异性特征。

Abstract: Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are conducted for long-lived stable
atmospheric boundary layers (SABLs) maintained by constant ambient
stratification and surface cooling. The study examines how stratification
mechanism and strength influence turbulence within a four-dimensional parameter
space defined by the stratification perturbation parameter ($\Pi_s$),
wind-forcing parameter ($\Pi_w$), Rossby-radius factor ($\Pi_f$), and Prandtl
number. A regime map in the $\Pi_s-\Pi_w$ plane identifies linearly stable,
very stable, and weakly stable regimes, showing that turbulence sustenance is
inherently multi-parametric. At low $\Pi_s$ and high $\Pi_w$, a weakly stable
regime with persistent turbulence emerges. The SABL exhibits a multilayered
thermal structure-comprising a near-surface stable layer, an intermediate
unstable layer, and an overlying inversion-that strengthens with decreasing
$\Pi_s$, indicating enhanced downward heat transport. Turbulence statistics
reveal weak dependence of the momentum field and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)
on stratification, while buoyancy and turbulent potential energy (TPE) show
strong sensitivity due to additional production from turbulent heat flux
interacting with ambient stratification. Energy transfer occurs among mean
gradients, momentum-buoyancy flux, and TKE-TPE exchange. The turbulent Prandtl
number exhibits strong vertical variation, exceeding values typical of
nocturnal SABLs, underscoring the limits of constant eddy-diffusivity models.
Barycentric anisotropy maps indicate weak near-surface effects but enhanced
isotropy aloft. These results motivate improved parameterizations for
ambient-stratification-dominated SABLs.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非定常流固耦合分析的界面控制原理，通过显式控制界面运动来最小化残余力，使流体和结构模拟可以独立进行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流固耦合分析需要流体和结构模拟之间的实时通信，这限制了计算效率。本文旨在开发一种方法，使两个系统能够独立运行，通过预定义的界面状态信息来提高计算效率。

Method: 采用数据驱动方法构建界面模型，通过稀疏识别非线性动力学与控制来评估残余力，然后应用控制理论最小化残余力。流体和结构模拟可以独立进行，无需通信。

Result: 在雷诺数为150的圆柱涡激振动案例中，残余力随时间充分最小化。当残余力接近零时，预测的流体力和结构位移与参考流固耦合模拟结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 所提出的界面控制原理能够有效最小化残余力，使流体和结构模拟可以独立进行，同时保持与完整流固耦合模拟相当的精度。

Abstract: An interface control principle is proposed for unsteady fluid-structure in-
teraction (FSI) analyses. This principle introduces a method of explicitly
controlling the interface motion in the temporal direction to minimize the
residual force on the interface, which is defined as the discrepancy between
the fluid and structural forces. The interface model is constructed using a
data-driven approach that involves sparse identification of nonlinear dy-
namics with control to evaluate the residual force. The interface model is
subsequently subjected to control theory in order to minimize the residual
force. Following the convergence of the residual force, the interface state is
controlled to be that of the original unsteady FSI system. The fluid and
structural simulations can be conducted independently without communication, as
the interface state information is predetermined as inputs for each system. The
proposed method is applied to the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a cylinder
at a Reynolds number of 150 under several reduced velocity conditions
corresponding to the lock-in regime with limit-cycle oscillations. The results
demonstrate that the residual force is sufficiently minimized in time, and when
the residual force is close to zero, the predicted fluid force and structural
displacement of the VIV show good agreement with the reference FSI simulation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强型并行物理信息神经网络MF-PINNs，通过结合速度-压力形式和流函数-涡量形式来解决多物理场耦合问题，改善了在极端物理参数条件下的训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行PINNs在处理具有极端物理常数（如运动粘度和渗透率张量从1e-4到1e4）的偏微分方程时，会导致损失函数病态甚至训练失败。

Method: 将速度-压力形式(VP)与流函数-涡量形式(SV)相结合，并以调整后的权重添加到总损失函数中，同时探索了最佳激活函数组合及其周期性，以及初始学习率设置和衰减策略。

Result: 数值实验表明，MF-PINNs成功提高了流线场和压力场的精度，在运动粘度和渗透率张量从1e-4到1e4范围内均表现良好。

Conclusion: MF-PINNs有望应用于涉及湍流等更混沌的PDE系统，相关代码和数据已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Parallel physical information neural networks (P-PINNs) have been widely used
to solve systems with
  multiple coupled physical fields, such as the coupled Stokes-Darcy equations
with Beavers-Joseph-Saffman (BJS) interface
  conditions. However, excessively high or low physical constants in partial
differential equations (PDE) often lead to ill conditioned loss functions and
can even cause the failure of training numerical solutions for PINNs. To solve
this problem,
  we develop a new kind of enhanced parallel PINNs, MF-PINNs, in this article.
Our MF-PINNs combines the velocity pressure form (VP) with the stream-vorticity
form (SV) and add them with adjusted weights to the total loss functions.
  The results of numerical experiments show our MF-PINNs have successfully
improved the accuracy of the streamline fields
  and the pressure fields when kinematic viscosity and permeability tensor
range from 1e-4 to 1e4. Thus, our MF-PINNs
  hold promise for more chaotic PDE systems involving turbulent flows.
Additionally, we also explore the best combination of
  the activation functions and their periodicity. And we also try to set the
initial learning rate and design its decay strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种单网格模型，完全解析生物质颗粒热解过程中的固相和气相耦合作用，无需依赖亚网格尺度关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生物质颗粒热解数值模型要么关注固相颗粒演化，要么关注周围气相动力学，忽略了两个相之间的耦合相互作用。

Method: 采用欧拉表示法描述两相系统，使用VOF方法跟踪生物质与周围气相之间的界面，包含固相热解反应，并提出新方法捕捉生物质孔隙度演化与颗粒收缩之间的耦合关系。

Result: 模型展示了质量守恒和数值收敛性。与实验数据的广泛验证显示在质量和温度分布以及挥发物趋势方面具有良好一致性。收缩分布显示正确趋势，但也突显了对生物质结构演化需要更好基础理解的需求。

Conclusion: 该模型在帮助开发可持续热解过程方面迈出了重要一步，相关代码和模拟设置在开源Basilisk框架中开发并公开可用。

Abstract: Numerical models of biomass particle pyrolysis focus on either the solid
particle evolution or on the surrounding gas-phase dynamics, neglecting the
coupled interactions between the two. This work addresses this limitation by
proposing a single-grid model that fully resolves both phases without relying
on sub-grid-scale correlations. The model adopts an Eulerian representation of
the two-phase system, using a Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) method to track the
interface between the biomass and the surrounding gas phase. Solid-phase
pyrolysis reactions are included, and a novel approach is proposed to capture
the coupling between the evolution of biomass porosity and the particle
shrinkage. The anisotropic nature of the biomass particle is accounted for in
this multidimensional framework. The resulting model demonstrates mass
conservation and numerical convergence. Extensive validation with experimental
data shows excellent agreement in terms of mass and temperature profiles and
correct volatiles trends. Shrinking profiles reveal correct trends, but they
also highlight the need for a better fundamental understanding of the evolution
of the biomass structure. Overall, the model takes a step forward in aiding the
development of sustainable pyrolysis processes. The code and simulation setups,
developed within the open-source Basilisk framework, are made publicly
available.

TL;DR: VisuoAlign是一个通过提示引导树搜索实现多模态安全对齐的框架，旨在解决大型视觉语言模型在跨模态攻击下的安全对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法对多模态越狱攻击存在脆弱性，因为视觉输入引入了新的攻击面，推理链缺乏安全监督，且模态融合会降低对齐效果。

Method: 通过视觉-文本交互提示将安全约束嵌入推理过程，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建多样化的安全关键提示轨迹，并引入基于提示的缩放实现实时风险检测和合规响应。

Result: 实验表明VisuoAlign能主动暴露风险，支持全面的数据集生成，并显著提升LVLMs对抗复杂跨模态威胁的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VisuoAlign框架有效解决了多模态安全对齐的关键挑战，为大型视觉语言模型提供了更强大的安全防护能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a
critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks,
as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety
supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome
these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety
alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains
into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse
safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to
ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive
dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against
complex cross-modal threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏真正的认知理解，暴露了认知架构的缺失。传统AI研究关注"什么是智能"的本体论问题，而SCL关注"在什么条件下认知会涌现"的认识论问题。

Method: 基于过程哲学、具身认知和扩展心智理论，将智能定义为执行过程而非属性，构建包含判断、记忆、控制、行动和调节的连续循环框架。

Result: SCL展示了认知架构中的功能分离比单一提示系统产生更一致和可解释的行为，支持智能作为认知状态重建能力而非表征准确性的新定义。

Conclusion: SCL框架对心智哲学、认识论和AI产生重要影响，强调真正的进步需要实现认知原则的结构化架构，而不仅仅是更大的模型。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic
understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This
paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable
epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI
research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what
conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of
mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and
implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and
extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a
performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,
and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes
philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling
"executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it
shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more
coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,
supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not
representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic
state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of
mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to
be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure
rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not
as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a
phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive
phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real
progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive
principles structurally.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: citiverses具有通过沉浸式虚拟环境支持监管学习的潜力，为政策场景和技术实验提供平台，需要制定科学政策议程来探索这一潜力。

Method: 基于与高级专家小组（包括欧盟委员会政策制定者、国家政府科学顾问和数字监管领域领先研究人员）的咨询，识别关键研究领域和实验主题。

Result: 确定了关键研究领域（可扩展性、实时反馈、复杂性建模等）和实验主题（交通、城市规划、环境气候危机等），提出了将citiverses整合到更广泛实验生态系统中的初步步骤。

Conclusion: citiverses有潜力成为监管学习的重要实验空间，但需要负责任的发展方法，充分考虑伦理、经济、生态和社会维度，并整合到更广泛的实验生态系统中。

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering
immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and
technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the
potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning,
grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including
policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers
and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies
key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity
modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation,
ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In
addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning
transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could
be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas.
The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and
emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It
prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and
social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential
preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader
ecosystems of experimentation spaces, including test beds, living labs and

Motivation: 现有AI代理记忆系统缺乏对多样化任务的适应性，且忽视了记忆的建设性和任务导向作用。受皮亚杰认知发展理论启发，研究者旨在开发一个更实用的记忆系统。

Method: 提出PISA系统，包含三模态适应机制（图式更新、图式演化和图式创建）来保持连贯组织并支持灵活记忆更新，以及结合符号推理与神经检索的混合记忆访问架构。

Result: 在LOCOMO基准和新提出的AggQA数据分析任务基准上的实证评估表明，PISA在适应性和长期知识保留方面创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PISA通过将记忆视为建设性和适应性过程，成功解决了现有记忆系统的局限性，为AI代理提供了更有效的记忆能力。

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks
adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented
role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development,
we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that
addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive
process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a
trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and
schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible
memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design
a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic
reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO
benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks,
confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing
adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在复杂谜题中性能崩溃的原因，特别是验证环境状态跟踪是否是影响真实推理评估的混淆因素。

Method: 为LLM提供汉诺塔问题的环境接口，允许其通过工具调用进行移动、提供书面理由、观察状态空间并重新提示下一步行动。

Result: 环境接口访问并不能延迟或消除性能崩溃，策略分析显示模型与最优策略和随机策略的偏离度增加，表现出模式崩溃现象。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型的性能崩溃可能源于模式崩溃现象，模型性能取决于其模式是否与问题正确解决方案匹配。

Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in
performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In
subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the
task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the
requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide
a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi
problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written
justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the
next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or
eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis
reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random
policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level
of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects
the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might
take place in LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知负荷理论启发，旨在为深度模型提供可解释的推理过程分析框架，理解模型在推理任务中的内部资源分配模式。

Method: 定义CLTs为三组分随机过程(IL_t, EL_t, GL_t)，分别对应内在、外在和相关负荷，通过注意力熵、KV缓存未命中率、表示分散度、解码稳定性等可测量代理指标进行实例化，并提出符号化公式和可视化方法。

Result: 在推理和规划基准测试中，CLTs能够预测错误发生、揭示认知策略，并通过负荷引导的干预措施将推理效率提高15-30%同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: CLTs框架为深度模型的推理过程提供了有效的可解释性分析工具，能够识别和优化模型的认知负荷分配，提升推理效率。

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level
interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory
in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions
that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs
as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t,
\mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and
\emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies
such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and
decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization
methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of
reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that
CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided
interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining
accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProofFlow是一个新的证明自动形式化流水线，通过构建逻辑依赖图和使用基于引理的方法来保持原始证明的结构保真度，在自动形式化任务上达到了新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法主要关注生成可执行代码，但经常无法保持原始人工编写证明的语义含义和逻辑结构。为了解决这个问题，需要将结构保真度作为主要目标。

Method: ProofFlow首先构建有向无环图来映射证明步骤间的逻辑依赖关系，然后采用基于引理的方法系统地将每个步骤形式化为中间引理，从而保持原始论证的逻辑结构。

Result: 实验结果显示ProofFlow在自动形式化任务上达到了新的最先进水平，ProofScore得分为0.545，显著超过了全证明形式化（0.123）和步骤证明形式化（0.072）等基线方法。

Conclusion: ProofFlow通过关注结构保真度显著提升了证明自动形式化的质量，其流水线、基准和评分指标已开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems
and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating
large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches
focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the
semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument.
To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats
structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof
steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically
formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure
of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark
of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step
solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new
composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and
structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new
state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545,
substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which
processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which
handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are

Abstract: An essential component for evaluating and comparing physical and cognitive
capabilities between populations is the testing of various factors related to
human performance. As a core part of sports science research, testing motor
performance enables the analysis of the physical health of different
demographic groups and makes them comparable.
  The Motor Research (MO|RE) data repository, developed at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, is an infrastructure for publishing and archiving
research data in sports science, particularly in the field of motor performance
research. In this paper, we present our vision for creating a knowledge graph
from MO|RE data. With an ontology rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology, our
approach centers on formally representing the interrelation of plan
specifications, specific processes, and related measurements. Our goal is to
transform how motor performance data are modeled and shared across studies,
making it standardized and machine-understandable. The idea presented here is
developed within the Leibniz Science Campus ``Digital Transformation of
Research'' (DiTraRe).

*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Enrique Herrera-Viedma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于随机置换集(RPS)的冲突度量方法，从随机有限集(RFS)和D-S理论(DST)两个角度分析置换间的冲突，并引入基于秩偏重叠(RBO)的不一致性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涉及顺序信息的不确定性推理中，如何有效度量由置换质量函数表示的两个证据之间的冲突是一个亟待解决的研究课题。

Method: 从置换观察出发，首先基于秩偏重叠(RBO)度量定义置换间的不一致性度量，然后提出基于非重叠的RPS冲突度量方法，将RPS理论视为DST的扩展。

Result: 通过数值例子展示了所提冲突度量的行为和特性，该方法具有自然的顶部加权特性，能从DST视角有效度量RPS间的冲突。

Conclusion: 所提方法不仅具有顶部加权特性，能有效度量RPS间的冲突，还为决策者提供了权重、参数和截断深度的灵活选择。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with
uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two
pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent
research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper,
a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different
perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency
measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure
and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This
paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information
newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by
top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict
measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property
and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but
also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters,
and truncated depths.

TL;DR: PAINT是一种并行时间神经网络孪生方法，通过滑动窗口从测量数据预测系统状态，确保在轨迹上跟踪真实系统状态


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经代理模型在模拟动态系统时难以保持轨迹跟踪，需要开发能够从测量数据更新状态并保持轨迹一致性的神经孪生方法

Method: PAINT训练生成神经网络并行建模时间上的状态分布，测试时通过滑动窗口从测量数据预测状态

Result: 在二维湍流流体动力学问题上，PAINT能够保持轨迹跟踪，从稀疏测量数据高保真地预测系统状态

Conclusion: PAINT方法为开发保持轨迹跟踪的神经孪生提供了潜力，能够实现更准确的状态估计和决策制定

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems,
while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a
progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real
systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state,
thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of
neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to
the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins
(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical
systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model
the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are
predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical
analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models
generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging
two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that
PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements
with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing
neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation
and decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出ISGFAN框架，通过信息分离和全局-局部对抗学习解决噪声干扰和领域偏移共存的跨领域故障诊断问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移故障诊断方法假设数据干净或领域相似度高，但在工业环境中噪声干扰和领域偏移同时存在，限制了方法有效性

Method: 基于信息分离架构，结合对抗学习和改进的正交损失解耦领域不变故障表示；采用全局-局部领域对抗方案约束模型的条件和边缘分布

Result: 在三个公共基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他现有主流方法

Conclusion: ISGFAN框架在噪声条件下的跨领域故障诊断中表现出优越性

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data
or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial
environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To
address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal
adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault
diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation
architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal
loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise
interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen
transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme
that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model.
Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates
category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios,
while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall
distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing
approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework. Data and code
are available at https://github.com/JYREN-Source/ISGFAN

Motivation: 现代制造系统需要在应对随机任务持续时间的同时满足严格的交付期限，传统确定性调度在现实偏离名义计划时会失效，导致昂贵的紧急修复。

Method: 首先构建柔性作业车间的约束规划模型并插入最优缓冲Δ*，然后将计划转换为带不确定性的简单时间网络并验证动态可控性，确保实时调度器能够重新安排活动时间。

Result: 在Kacem 1-4基准套件上的蒙特卡洛模拟显示，该方法消除了最先进元启发式调度中观察到的100%截止期限违规，同时仅增加3-5%的制造周期开销。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了时间网络推理如何弥合主动缓冲与动态鲁棒性之间的差距，使工业更接近真正的数字化、自校正工厂。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping
with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability,
and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when
reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs.
This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with
online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible
under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible
job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to
obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a
Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic
controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime
activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or
deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4
benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline
violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding
only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP
solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The
work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between
proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to
truly digital, self-correcting factories.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了LLM生成的临床思维链的可靠性，发现选择性少样本策略显著优于零样本和随机少样本策略，提出了基于"黄金标准深度"和"代表性多样性"的双原则框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量临床思维链对于可解释医疗AI至关重要，但面临数据稀缺的约束。虽然LLM可以合成医疗数据，但其临床可靠性尚未验证。

Method: 在辅助生殖技术领域进行盲法比较研究，资深临床医生评估三种策略生成的思维链：零样本、随机少样本（使用浅层示例）和选择性少样本（使用多样化高质量示例）。

Result: 选择性少样本策略在所有人类评估指标上显著优于其他策略（p < .001）。随机少样本策略相比零样本基线无显著改进，表明低质量示例与无示例同样无效。AI评估器未能识别这些关键性能差异。

Conclusion: 合成思维链的临床可靠性取决于战略性的提示词优化，而非单纯示例的存在。提出了"双原则"框架作为生成可信数据的基础方法，确认了人类专业知识在评估高风险临床AI中的不可或缺作用。

Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for
explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data
scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data,
their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the
reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to
enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three
distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and
Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings
were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o).
The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies
across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot
strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline,
demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The
success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles:
"Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity"
(generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical
performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated
by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a
"Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate
trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data
bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating
high-stakes clinical AI.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI在企业决策中的广泛应用，传统基于人类代理人的企业犯罪意图认定方法面临挑战，需要重新定义企业知识的概念以适应算法时代。

Method: 开发了一个形式化模型，通过整合计算成本和统计验证错误率来度量企业知识状态，引入连续的组织知识度量S_S(φ)和企业范围认知能力指数K_S,t，并将这些定量指标映射到法律标准上。

Result: 提出了可测量的知识谓词K_S和认知能力指数，能够将定量指标操作化地映射到实际知识、推定知识、故意无视和鲁莽等法律标准上。

Conclusion: 该研究为在算法时代创建可测量和可司法审查的审计证据提供了途径，使企业思维变得可追踪和可问责。

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea},
traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under
challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making.
Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response
corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the
efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability
of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of
corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a
continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a
pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We
derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and
a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall
capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal
standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and
recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and
justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and
accountable in the algorithmic age.

Motivation: PHI去标识化评估通常依赖成本高昂的小规模专家标注，限制了模型的比较和选择。

Method: 部署多个评估智能体独立判断PHI提取正确性，通过LLM多数投票机制整合结果，生成稳定可复现的排名。

Result: 在真实临床笔记语料上的实验表明，TEAM-PHI能产生一致准确的排名，与监督评估和人工评估结果高度匹配。

Conclusion: TEAM-PHI为PHI去标识化提供了实用、安全且经济高效的自动评估和最佳模型选择解决方案。

Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling
the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI
de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert
annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection
framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure
de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy
reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each
independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting
structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based
majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a
single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical
note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate
rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting
reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with
ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's
automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining
independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a
practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and
best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels
are limited.

Method: 提出"被记住权"概念框架，旨在最小化AI驱动信息遗漏风险，保障公平对待权利，同时确保生成内容最大程度真实

Result: 建立了应对LLM信息偏见威胁的概念性解决方案框架

Conclusion: "被记住权"是应对LLM可能造成信息不平等和集体记忆重塑的重要概念工具

Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun
to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines
display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO),
advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response
that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of
bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple
perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare
alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors
whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a
result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately
suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this
creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital
presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping
collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of
the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of
AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while
ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our
large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms
deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We
openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use
and build on.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型推理模型在数学和编程等复杂任务上表现出色，作者发现这些模型存在一个关键漏洞：容易被提示中恶意嵌入的复杂无关任务分散注意力，从而影响主要任务的准确性。这种"推理分心"威胁到LRM的可靠性，需要系统分析和防御。

Method: 作者进行了跨多种模型和基准的全面研究，验证LRM对推理分心的敏感性。为缓解此风险，提出了基于监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)的训练防御方法，使用合成的对抗数据进行训练。

Result: 研究发现最先进的LRM高度易受推理分心影响，注入的分心任务可使任务准确性降低高达60%。某些对齐技术会放大此弱点，模型还可能表现出隐蔽顺从行为。提出的防御方法在具有挑战性的分心攻击上将鲁棒性提高了50多个点。

Conclusion: 推理分心是LRM可靠性的一个独特且紧迫的威胁。研究结果为构建更安全、更可信的推理系统提供了实用步骤，证明通过适当的训练方法可以有效缓解这一漏洞。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable
performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically
analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are
diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks
maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across
diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are
highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to
60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this
weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden
adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final
output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on
synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on
challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as
a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step
toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注智能体系统的推理性能，但忽视了系统效率问题。网络交互式智能体系统存在显著的延迟问题，需要优化。

Method: 将端到端延迟分解为LLM API延迟和网络环境延迟，提出SpecCache缓存框架，结合推测执行来优化网络环境开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM
capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web
interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential
errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning
performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency
bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency
into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to
demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web
environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a
web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching
framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment
overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our
approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching
strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without
degrading agentic system performance.

Conclusion: DTKG框架能够有效解决多跳问答中并行事实验证和链式推理的挑战，提高推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs).
The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of
entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency
and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into
two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,
i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent
sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding
sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as
essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning
approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact
verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former
excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning
tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning
but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel
fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and
accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by
the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two
main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the
verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee
consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG
improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields
1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how
MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss
ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

*Tong Zhang,Ru Zhang,Jianyi Liu,Zhen Yang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了SELECT框架，通过动态锚点选择解决文本到图像扩散模型中概念擦除的锚点敏感性问题，避免概念重现和侵蚀问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法依赖固定锚点策略，导致概念重现和侵蚀等关键问题，需要更智能的锚点选择方法

Method: 通过因果追踪揭示擦除对锚点选择的敏感性，定义兄弟排他概念作为更优锚点类别，提出两阶段评估机制自动发现最优锚点

Result: SELECT作为通用锚点解决方案，能高效适配多种擦除框架，在关键性能指标上持续优于现有基线，单个概念锚点挖掘仅需4秒

Conclusion: 动态锚点选择框架SELECT有效解决了固定锚点的局限性，实现了更精确的概念擦除

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly
rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as
concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to
reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define
Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for
Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to
overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel
two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for
precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related
concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor
solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also
consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,
averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

### [542] [The Burden of Interactive Alignment with Inconsistent Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16368)
*Ali Shirali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了用户如何通过策略性互动来引导算法与其真实兴趣对齐，提出了一个双系统决策模型和Stackelberg博弈框架，揭示了用户需要足够远见才能实现算法对齐，而小成本信号可以显著降低对齐负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究用户在算法推荐系统中如何克服偏好不一致性（如花时间在低价值内容上）来引导算法与其真实兴趣对齐的问题。

Method: 将用户决策建模为理性系统2（决定是否参与）和冲动系统1（决定参与时长）的双系统模型，采用多领导者-单跟随者的扩展Stackelberg博弈框架，其中用户作为领导者承诺参与策略，算法基于观察到的互动做出最佳响应。

Result: 发现存在一个关键时间范围：足够有远见的用户可以实现算法对齐，而缺乏远见的用户则会被算法目标所对齐。这个关键范围可能很长，但即使是一个小的成本信号（如额外点击）也能显著减少对齐负担。

Conclusion: 该框架解释了具有不一致偏好的用户如何在Stackelberg均衡中引导参与驱动型算法与其兴趣对齐，揭示了实现对齐的挑战和潜在补救措施。

Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact,
learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an
algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can
guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively
engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent
preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little
long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.
Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for
such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split
between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive
system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a
multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,
specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the
algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of
alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively
steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are
sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are
instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be
long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal
(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework
explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven
algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both
the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

### [543] [Before you <think>, monitor: Implementing Flavell's metacognitive framework in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16374)
*Nick Oh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合监控-生成-验证的三阶段迭代系统，在GSM8K数学推理任务上取得了75.42%的准确率，优于现有方法，且需要更少的尝试次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法存在两种孤立范式：监控-生成方法擅长策略规划但缺乏验证机制，生成-验证方法能迭代优化但缺乏任务评估。这种分离导致策略失败无反馈、优化无策略基础的低效问题。

Method: 基于Flavell的认知监控模型，实现监控-生成-验证框架的三阶段迭代系统，将任务评估、策略规划和结果验证有机结合。

Result: 在GSM8K上达到75.42%准确率，优于SELF-REFINE(68.44%)和Self-Verification(67.07%)，尝试次数更少(1.3 vs 2.0)，推理成本增加27-37%。

Conclusion: 前置监控能产生更高质量的初始解，减少优化需求，但需要在算术推理之外的任务上进一步验证通用性。

Abstract: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms:
Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and
SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack
mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify
approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan
et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly
without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies
fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We
address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979)
from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025),
operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary
results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for
Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37%
increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring
produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though
evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.

TL;DR: 提出了受人类智能启发的HSCM因果框架，通过解耦和重加权图像属性（颜色、纹理、形状）来增强跨域泛化能力，在理论和实证评估中都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统领域泛化模型的局限性，模仿人类视觉系统的层次处理和多级学习机制，专注于建模细粒度因果机制。

Method: 构建人类启发的结构因果模型，解耦和重加权关键图像属性（颜色、纹理、形状），复制人类视觉系统的分层处理过程。

Result: HSCM在理论和实证评估中均优于现有领域泛化模型，提供了更原则性的方法来捕捉因果关系并提高模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HSCM通过模仿人类智能的灵活性和适应性，在动态复杂环境中实现了更有效的迁移和学习，为领域泛化提供了新的因果框架。

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a
novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the
limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches
that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn
distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical
processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on
modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key
image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances
generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and
interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human
intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in
dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain
generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal
relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RGMem是一个基于重整化群思想的自进化记忆框架，通过多尺度组织对话历史，从片段语义提取到层次粗粒化，逐步形成动态演化的用户画像，实现语言代理的长期记忆和行为一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对话系统受限于有限上下文窗口和静态参数记忆，难以建模跨会话的长期用户状态和行为一致性。RAG和显式记忆系统主要关注事实级存储检索，缺乏从多轮对话中提取潜在偏好和深层特质的能力。

Method: 受物理学重整化群思想启发，RGMem框架将对话历史组织为多尺度结构：从片段语义提取开始，通过层次粗粒化和重标度操作，逐步形成动态演化的用户画像。

Result: 该框架将记忆演化建模为信息压缩和涌现的多尺度过程，能够从噪声和微观级交互中实现高层准确的用户画像。

Conclusion: RGMem通过多尺度记忆组织实现了语言代理的长期记忆和行为一致性，解决了现有系统在深度用户建模和跨会话连续性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user
experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems,
however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it
difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral
consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily
focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill
latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits
the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized
interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To
realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in
LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the
ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework
enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts
semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical
coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a
dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in
modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression
and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles
from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统擅长预测用户偏好，但缺乏将客户评论转化为面向业务的规范性建议的能力，需要开发能提供更深层次洞察的框架。

Method: 整合聚类、大语言模型适配和专家驱动评估的统一业务导向流程，识别客户情绪中的关键趋势、重复问题和具体关注点。

Result: 初步人工评估显示模型建议与业务目标高度一致，证明了其在数据驱动决策中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI驱动的情感分析提供了新视角，展示了其在优化业务策略和最大化客户反馈价值方面的重要作用。

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the
ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential.
While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far
less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive,
business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel
prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language
models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business
recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific
concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond
preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for
sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies
in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a
unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate
strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives,
highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This
framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis,
demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the
impact of customer feedback.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NP-ENGINE框架，这是首个用于训练和评估LLMs在NP难问题上的综合框架，包含10个任务、可控实例生成器、规则验证器和启发式求解器。通过该框架训练的QWEN2.5-7B-NP模型在NP-BENCH基准上显著优于GPT-4o，并实现了强大的跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在数学、编程、逻辑等推理任务上表现出色，但在解决更复杂的NP难优化问题方面的能力尚未充分探索，需要专门的训练框架和评估基准。

Method: 提出NP-ENGINE框架，包含可控实例生成器、规则验证器和启发式求解器的生成-验证-启发式流水线，支持可扩展的层次化难度RLVR训练。使用零RLVR和课程学习在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上训练模型。

Result: 训练的QWEN2.5-7B-NP模型在NP-BENCH基准上显著超越GPT-4o，达到同模型尺寸下的SOTA性能。同时展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力，包括推理任务和非推理任务，且任务多样性增加能提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务丰富的RLVR训练是提升LLM推理能力的有前景方向，揭示了RLVR的扩展规律，为LLM在复杂优化问题上的应用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with
models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as
mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex
optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To
bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for
training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks
across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,
(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides
approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This
generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR
training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a
benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'
ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on
feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present
QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and
achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we
demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge),
as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a
scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These
findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for
advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws
of RLVR.

Motivation: 基于人类技能获取的认知模型，希望通过程序合成的方式实现高效技能学习，超越现有方法的效率限制，更接近人类大脑中实际存在的心理表征及其获取过程。

Method: 将轻量线性函数式编程语言编码到向量符号架构中，使用基于全息声明性记忆的槽值编码方案表示类型，使用Lisp VSA变体编码项，使类型在嵌入空间中可被神经网络学习。

Result: 该方法使神经网络能够学习类型，其中邻近点的类型在结构和内容上相似，为高效技能获取提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: Doug语言为实现人类水平的技能获取效率迈出了重要一步，能够更准确地建模人类大脑中的心理表征及其学习过程。

Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may
be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture
(VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming
language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are
encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative
memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the
Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the
embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types
of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are
therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,
1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or
program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may
therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a
form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill
acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),
exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;
Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling
human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and
those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

Method: 采用强化学习后训练框架Urban-R1，使用组相对策略优化(GRPO)来优化跨地理群体的推理，并以城市区域画像作为代理任务从多模态城市数据提供可测量的奖励。

Result: 跨多个区域和任务的广泛实验表明，Urban-R1有效缓解了地理偏见并改善了跨区域泛化，优于监督微调训练和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习对齐是实现公平可信城市智能的有前景途径。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence
(UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex
urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit
persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited
generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement
learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of
UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize
reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a
proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive
experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively
mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both
SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement
learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy
urban intelligence.

knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates
for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To
address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned

extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across
multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for
supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Ripple Effect Protocol (REP)，一种协调协议，让智能体不仅共享决策，还共享轻量级敏感度信号，表达关键环境变量变化时其选择如何改变，从而在群体中实现更快更稳定的协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体通信协议（如A2A和ACP）强调通信而非协调，随着智能体群体规模扩大，这种局限性导致脆弱的集体行为，即使个体智能体很聪明，群体结果也很差。

Method: 引入REP协议，智能体共享决策和轻量级敏感度信号，这些敏感度在局部网络中传播；形式化REP协议规范，分离必需的消息模式与可选的聚合规则；在三种场景下评估：供应链级联、稀疏网络中的偏好聚合、可持续资源分配。

Result: 在三个领域（啤酒游戏、电影调度、渔业银行）的基准测试显示，REP相比A2A提高了41%到100%的协调准确性和效率，并能灵活处理来自LLM的多模态敏感度信号。

Conclusion: 通过将协调作为协议级能力，REP为新兴的智能体互联网提供了可扩展的基础设施。

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP,
yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent
populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where
individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the
Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not
only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing
how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These
sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster
and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's
protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional
aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and
network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades
(Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling),
and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves
coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly
handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a
protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the
emerging Internet of Agents

Motivation: 现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法难以从文本丰富的知识图谱中为复杂现实查询检索准确多样的信息，而过程奖励模型需要昂贵的过程级监督信号。

Method: 使用基于转移的流匹配目标联合优化检索策略和流估计器，流估计器将检索结果的奖励分解到中间检索状态，指导检索策略按比例从知识图谱中检索候选结果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances
large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external
knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate
and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries.
Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of
KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely
on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on
KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that
efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world
queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching
objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow
estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate
retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to
retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows
GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and
relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes
real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow
outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit
rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: ssCDL通过置信度分布学习和半监督方法有效解决了不确定知识图谱补全中的置信度不平衡问题，提升了补全性能。

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence
score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since
real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG)
completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and
confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this
problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple
confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to
high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue,
we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL)
method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a
confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different
confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively
learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing
triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen
triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning
to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple
confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: MERCI是一种新颖的强化学习算法，通过基于计数的内在奖励来增强LLM推理中的探索，避免重复和次优的推理模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL范式依赖稀疏的结果奖励和有限探索，导致LLM陷入重复和次优的推理模式，需要设计更好的探索机制。

Method: 使用轻量级的Coin Flipping Network估计推理轨迹的伪计数和认知不确定性，将其转化为内在奖励，并集成到GRPO等RL框架中。

Result: 在复杂推理基准测试中，MERCI鼓励更丰富多样的思维链，显著超越强基线，帮助策略逃离局部模式发现更好解决方案。

Conclusion: 目标化的内在动机可以使语言模型推理中的探索更加可靠有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the
multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited
exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design
exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in
LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that
augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on
the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin
Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic
uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic
reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task
rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of
thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps
the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates
that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for
language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a
transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm
shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of
end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we
explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major
neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer
interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,
clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific
applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are
demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including
multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and
the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,
the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,
as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to
develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review
highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation
considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,
effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines
for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience
datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse
research applications is provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂车辆路径问题需要大量专家努力进行意图解释和算法设计，现有LLM方法仍依赖外部干预，导致自主性受限、执行错误和解决方案可行性低。

Method: AFL框架将整体流程分解为三个可管理子任务，采用四个专门代理的协调交互来确保跨功能一致性和逻辑合理性，直接从原始输入提取知识并实现自包含代码生成。

Result: 在60个复杂VRP上的广泛实验验证了框架的有效性和通用性，与精心设计的算法性能相当，在代码可靠性和解决方案可行性方面显著优于现有LLM基线，在评估基准上接近100%的成功率。

Conclusion: AFL框架实现了从问题实例到解决方案的完全自动化，为复杂车辆路径问题的自动化求解提供了可信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge,
demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm
design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward
automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which
restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution
feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with
LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full
automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge
from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted
modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the
overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized
agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and
logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from
standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and
generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against
meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms
existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility,
achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial
intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but
act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building
agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory
are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,
where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We
first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling
this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to
outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task
across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey
systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --
has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.
Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent
applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon
reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by
discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like
Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the
system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments
outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated
learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing
systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence
through experience.

Conclusion: 讨论了构建可靠和可扩展的RL驱动智能搜索系统的开放挑战和未来方向，希望激发RL与智能搜索集成的研究。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven
engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with
optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two
central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration
requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and
reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a
workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on
compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency
approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every
simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design
to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we
proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using
surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The
methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect
and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency
of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy
and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the
approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis
of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation.
Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale
exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors,
identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates
require more data or alternative architectures.

TL;DR: ELMM提出了一种高效轻量化的多模态大语言模型，通过多视角视觉令牌压缩器和注意力剪枝策略，解决了多模态知识图谱补全中的语义噪声、模态冲突和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MKGs存在不完整性问题，而多模态大语言模型在MKGC任务中面临图像令牌过多导致的语义噪声、模态冲突以及高计算成本等挑战。

Method: 提出MVTC基于多头注意力机制从文本和视觉视角自适应压缩图像令牌，设计注意力剪枝策略移除冗余层，并使用线性投影补偿性能损失。

Result: 在FB15k-237-IMG和WN18-IMG基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: ELMM为多模态知识图谱补全建立了新范式，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove
redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the
inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the
performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark
FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art
performance while substantially improving computational efficiency,
establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

<details>

Motivation: 人类交互本质上是多模态和全双工的，需要同时感知和生成多种模态信息，而现有模型难以实现这种能力。

Method: 采用新颖的SA-MoE架构，将各模态路由到专用专家模块，通过统一注意力骨干网络进行融合，实现联合多模态感知和并发生成。

Result: 在语音交互和机器人操作基准测试中，ELLSA达到单模态基线水平，同时支持高级多模态和全双工行为，如对话和动作轮转、缺陷指令拒绝、边说话边行动等。

Conclusion: ELLSA代表了向更自然和通用交互智能迈出的一步，为追求通用人工智能做出贡献。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在图理解中存在输入token限制导致的扩展性瓶颈，以及缺乏有效的文本和视觉模态协调机制。

Method: GraphVista采用分层方法将图信息组织到GraphRAG基础中，仅检索任务相关的文本描述和高分辨率视觉子图；同时引入规划代理根据任务复杂度路由到最适合的模态。

Result: 实验表明GraphVista可扩展到比现有基准大200倍的图，性能比现有文本、视觉和融合方法提升高达4.4倍。

Conclusion: GraphVista通过充分利用两种模态的互补优势，显著提升了图理解的可扩展性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but
remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and
lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To
address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that
enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For
scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,
achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱受限于固定本体论的刚性层次结构，根本原因在于将领域视为隐式上下文而非显式的推理级组件。

Method: 采用C-D-C三元组结构，基于认知-语言同构映射原理，定义20多个标准化关系谓词，并在Prolog中实现完整推理能力。

Result: 在教育、企业知识系统和技术文档等案例研究中，CDC实现了上下文感知推理、跨领域类比和个性化知识建模。

Conclusion: CDC框架能够实现传统基于本体的框架无法达到的上下文感知推理、跨领域类比和个性化知识建模能力。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that
organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in
treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level
components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized
Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains
to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple
structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications
serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a
cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how
humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than
twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and
temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case
studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation
demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and
personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional
ontology-based frameworks.

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练视觉语言模型(VLM)智能体面临从文本状态到复杂视觉观察的转变，这引入了部分可观测性并需要强大的世界建模能力。研究旨在探索VLM智能体是否能够通过显式视觉状态推理构建内部世界模型。

Method: 将问题建模为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(POMDP)，通过强化学习架构性地强制和奖励智能体的推理过程。将推理分解为状态估计和转移建模，设计了五种推理策略。引入世界建模奖励提供密集的回合级监督，并提出双层通用优势估计(Bi-Level GAE)进行回合感知的信用分配。

Result: 一个30亿参数的模型在五个不同的智能体基准测试中获得了0.82的分数，相比未训练对应模型(0.21)提升了3倍，并优于专有推理模型如GPT-5(0.75)、Gemini 2.5 Pro(0.67)和Claude 4.5(0.62)。

Conclusion: 通过视觉状态推理，VLM智能体能够有效构建内部世界模型。最优的信念表示形式是任务依赖的：自然语言在通用任务中表现优异，而结构化格式对于精确操作和控制至关重要。提出的方法在VAGEN框架中实现了可扩展的多回合VLM智能体训练。

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to
Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex
visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and
demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world
models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we
architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via
reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into
State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what
comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning
strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs
reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language
excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured
formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on
these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,
turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level
General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.
Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a
score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$
improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary
reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5
(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable
system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual
environments. Code and data are publicly available at

Result: 只有一种算法在测试目标上达到了超过随机水平的准确率；用户普遍对自己的选择过度自信；用户自我报告的解释易识别性和理解程度与其实际准确率不相关。

Conclusion: 当前的可解释强化学习算法在帮助用户识别智能体目标方面的效果有限，且用户的自我评估与实际表现存在偏差。

Abstract: Debugging is a core application of explainable reinforcement learning (XRL)
algorithms; however, limited comparative evaluations have been conducted to
understand their relative performance. We propose a novel evaluation
methodology to test whether users can identify an agent's goal from an
explanation of its decision-making. Utilising the Atari's Ms. Pacman
environment and four XRL algorithms, we find that only one achieved greater
than random accuracy for the tested goals and that users were generally
overconfident in their selections. Further, we find that users' self-reported
ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not
correlate with their accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体协作框架，用于自动化GPU内核优化，通过系统化探索设计空间和迭代优化，显著提升了内核性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内核效率对现代AI发展至关重要，但优化过程复杂且劳动密集。现有LLM方法主要作为单次生成器或简单优化工具，难以应对不规则的核优化场景。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，包含基础指令、动态上下文管理和策略搜索，模拟专家工程师工作流程，让LLM能够推理硬件权衡、整合性能分析反馈并进行迭代优化。

Result: 在KernelBench基准测试中，相比基线智能体，该系统能产生正确解决方案（基线经常失败），并实现高达16倍的运行时性能提升。

Conclusion: 智能体LLM框架在实现完全自动化、可扩展的GPU内核优化方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet
optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex
interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and
hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing
approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement
tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel
optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel
optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent
collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic
search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs
to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine
kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for
LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often
fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These
results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully
automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolCritic是一个诊断框架，用于评估和改进LLM在多轮工具增强对话中的行为，通过检测8种特定工具调用错误并提供针对性反馈，使主LLM能够修正响应，在SGD数据集上比基线方法提升工具调用准确率高达13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强的大型语言模型在现实应用中越来越普遍，但工具使用错误仍然阻碍其可靠性，需要系统性的方法来检测和纠正这些错误。

Method: ToolCritic框架检测8种特定的工具调用错误类型（如过早调用、参数不对齐、工具输出误解等），为具有强推理能力的主LLM提供针对性反馈，主LLM基于反馈修正响应。通过系统定义错误类别并构建合成数据集来训练ToolCritic。

Result: 在Schema-Guided Dialogue数据集上的实验结果表明，ToolCritic比零样本提示和自校正等基线方法提升了高达13%的工具调用准确率。

Conclusion: ToolCritic是朝着在现实世界对话应用中更稳健地集成LLM与外部工具的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in
real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability.
We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM
behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight
distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation,
argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides
targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong
reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its
response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error
categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental
results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic
improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot
prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step
toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue
applications.

TL;DR: BRAINCELL-AID是一个多智能体AI系统，通过整合自由文本描述和本体标签，结合检索增强生成技术，显著提高了基因集注释的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序在识别细胞类型方面表现出色，但对涉及特征不明确基因的转录组特征进行注释仍然是一个重大挑战。传统方法依赖精心策划的注释，在这些情况下表现不佳。

Method: 开发了一个多智能体AI系统，整合自由文本描述和本体标签，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术，通过相关PubMed文献精炼预测，减少幻觉并增强可解释性。

Result: 在顶级预测中实现了77%的小鼠基因集正确注释，成功注释了BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network生成的5,322个脑细胞簇，识别了区域特异性基因共表达模式，并推断出基因集合的功能作用。

Conclusion: BRAINCELL-AID创建了一个有价值的资源来支持社区驱动的细胞类型注释，能够识别具有神经学意义描述的基底神经节相关细胞类型。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了两种基于大语言模型的系统用于企业信用评估中的证据推理：单代理系统(NAS)和基于辩论的多代理系统(KPD-MADS)，后者基于卡尔·波普的批判性对话框架，在推理质量和实用性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业信用评估中定性非财务指标难以形式化的问题，现有方法主要关注数值预测，缺乏对专业贷款评估所需解释性判断的支持。

Method: 开发了两种LLM系统：单代理系统(NAS)通过单次推理管道产生双向分析；多代理辩论系统(KPD-MADS)采用十步结构化交互协议实现对抗性验证。

Result: 两个系统均显著提升生产力(NAS:11.55秒/案例；KPD-MADS:91.97秒；人工基准:1920秒)。KPD-MADS在解释充分性、实际适用性和可用性方面获得更高评分。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理交互能够增强金融AI中的推理严谨性和可解释性，推动企业信用评估的可扩展和可辩护自动化。

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning
remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative
non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes
yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical
prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required
in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two
operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate
structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a
non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis
through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based
multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification
through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's
critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate
cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to
manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains
(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The
KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median
ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs.
3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured
multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in
financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit
assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、不一致性和难以标准化的问题，需要客观、可靠的自动化评估方法。

Method: 从鱼眼图像中系统提取和增量融合互补特征描述符，包括颜色统计、多色彩空间直方图、局部二值模式和灰度共生矩阵等纹理特征，捕获全局色度变化和局部退化特征。

Result: 在标准训练-测试设置下，LightGBM分类器达到77.56%准确率，比之前深度学习基线提高14.35%；使用增强数据时，人工神经网络达到97.16%准确率，比之前最佳结果提高19.86%。

Conclusion: 精心设计的手工特征经过策略性处理后，能够为自动化鱼类新鲜度评估提供稳健、可解释且可靠的解决方案，对食品质量监测具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food
industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and
consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective,
inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by
subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we
propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and
incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics,
histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local
Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish
eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images
and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to
evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's
effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved
77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline
of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached
97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results
demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically
processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated
fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical
applications in food quality monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HVAC系统能耗巨大，现有方法存在局限性：基于规则的方法可解释但缺乏适应性，深度学习方法预测能力强但缺乏透明度和物理合理性，而现有LLM方法忽视了HVAC运行的物理原理。

Method: 开发了PILLM框架，在进化循环中结合物理知识反射和交叉算子，嵌入热力学和控制理论约束，自动生成、评估和优化异常检测规则。

Result: 在公开的建筑故障检测数据集上，PILLM实现了最先进的性能，同时生成可解释和可操作的诊断规则。

Conclusion: PILLM推进了智能建筑系统中可信赖和可部署AI的发展，平衡了预测性能、可解释性和物理合理性。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a
substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly
detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical
rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep
learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency,
efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language
Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore
the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a
Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to
automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our
approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that
embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are
both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault
Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while
producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing
trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

TL;DR: ProtocolBench是一个系统评估多智能体系统通信协议的基准测试，ProtocolRouter是一个可学习的协议路由器，能根据场景需求动态选择最优协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模多智能体系统中，通信协议选择缺乏标准化指导，通常基于直觉而非系统评估，这影响了系统性能和可靠性。

Method: 开发ProtocolBench基准测试，从任务成功率、端到端延迟、消息开销和故障恢复能力四个维度系统比较协议；提出ProtocolRouter，通过学习选择最优协议。

Result: 协议选择显著影响系统行为：在流式队列场景中，完成时间差异达36.5%，端到端延迟差异3.48秒；ProtocolRouter比最佳单协议基线减少故障恢复时间18.1%。

Conclusion: 协议选择对多智能体系统性能至关重要，ProtocolBench和ProtocolRouter提供了系统化的协议评估和选择方法，能显著提升系统可靠性。

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer
has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and
reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,
etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We
introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent
protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message
or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol
choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue
scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and
mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery,
resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we
present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario
(or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter
reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol
baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA.
We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and
improve reliability at scale.

TL;DR: 开发了一种结合ECG基础模型和可解释XGBoost分类器的混合预测框架，用于预测急性心肌梗死后恶性室性心律失常风险，在提高准确性的同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性心肌梗死后恶性室性心律失常是院内死亡的主要原因，传统风险评分性能有限，而端到端深度学习模型缺乏临床信任所需的可解释性。

Method: 使用ECG基础模型提取150维诊断概率特征，通过特征选择后训练XGBoost分类器，并采用SHAP方法进行可解释性分析。

Result: 混合模型AUC达到0.801，优于KNN(0.677)、RNN(0.676)和1D-CNN(0.720)。SHAP分析显示模型识别特征与临床知识高度一致。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为VT/VF风险预测提供了新范式，验证了基础模型输出作为有效自动化特征工程在构建可信赖、可解释AI临床决策支持系统中的应用。

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early
identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have
limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the
interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a
hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram
(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to
improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings
from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder
model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,
which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost
classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the
SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid
model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC
0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that
model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk
predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly
consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework
provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of
foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for
building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索工具增强型LLM健康教练在真实用户中的表现，特别关注个性化策略对不同用户群体的影响，以及如何通过评估优先的方法避免平均指标掩盖的群体伤害。

Method: 采用离线策略评估（OPE）分析因子化决策头（工具/风格），使用轻量级模拟器与隐藏原型进行策略测试，添加早期信息增益奖励来优化特质识别。

Result: 统一的重工具策略提高了日志中的平均价值，但损害了特定子群体；添加信息增益奖励可靠地缩短了特质识别时间，提高了目标成功率和pass@3指标。

Conclusion: 提出了评估优先的个性化路径：冻结生成器，在类型化奖励上学习子群体感知的决策头，并始终报告每个原型的指标以揭示平均指标掩盖的子群体伤害。

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In
a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE)
over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

Motivation: 准确建模疾病进展（如2型糖尿病）可以改善患者亚型分型和及时干预，但现有方法难以处理不规则时间采样数据和患者异质性，无法捕捉复杂的连续时间动态。

Method: 使用时间详细超图表示临床认可的进展轨迹，通过神经ODE框架学习连续时间进展动态，包含可学习的TD-Hypergraph Laplacian来捕捉疾病并发症标记在进展轨迹内和轨迹间的相互依赖关系。

Result: 在两个真实世界临床数据集上的实验表明，TD-HNODE在建模2型糖尿病和相关心血管疾病进展方面优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: TD-HNODE能够有效建模疾病进展的连续时间动态，解决了现有方法在处理不规则时间数据和患者异质性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's
disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health
records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2
diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely
interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn
continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event
samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and
pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack
adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex
continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these
limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on
clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and
learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.
TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the
interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and
inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets
demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the
progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but
faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data
integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions.
Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across
various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is
time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in
functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on
static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step
reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a
reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical
support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework.
Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools.
Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism
that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data
sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of
dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We
evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and

that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base
model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with
participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto
platforms (4.62/5).

Motivation: 密集多智能体路径规划问题在实时求解中仍然具有挑战性，现有方法表现不佳，需要结合学习和搜索的优势

Method: 开发混合框架，将MAGAT神经网络策略集成到LaCAM搜索算法中，采用增强的MAGAT架构、预训练-微调策略和死锁检测机制

Result: LaGAT在密集场景中优于纯搜索和纯学习方法，证明混合搜索在紧密耦合的多智能体协调问题中的有效性

Conclusion: 经过精心设计的混合搜索为具有挑战性的多智能体协调问题提供了强大的解决方案

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent

TL;DR: 提出了FBI_LTL，一种用于仿真规划问题的多样化规划器，使用线性时序逻辑定义语义多样性标准，生成语义多样而非仅语法不同的规划方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于仿真规划的单一规划方案可能无法满足智能体偏好，现有多样化规划方法可能产生语法不同但语义相同的解决方案，存在局限性。

Method: 利用线性时序逻辑定义语义多样性标准，并将这些基于LTL的多样性模型直接集成到搜索过程中，确保生成语义多样化的规划。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，FBI_LTL相比基线方法能生成更多样化的规划方案。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了在仿真环境中进行语义引导多样化规划的可行性，为在传统基于模型方法失效的现实非符号领域开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

<details>

Motivation: 为了在侦察地理区域时维持共同的作战态势图，需要一种能够平衡探索未知区域和跟踪已识别目标的方法。

Conclusion: 主动推理路径规划方法成功解决了智能体在侦察任务中的探索与利用平衡问题，为自主控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching
extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target
objects.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 法律机器学习需要处理标签不确定性，因为法律结果常受人为干预影响，导致同一案件可能有不同结果。本文通过欧洲人权法院案例研究展示了标签构建方式对模型行为的显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统法律机器学习将过去案件结果视为绝对真实，但法律结果常受和解、上诉等人为干预影响，造成标签不确定性。这种不确定性未被现有方法充分考虑。

Method: 在欧洲人权法院案例分类的背景下，研究不同标签构建方式对模型行为的影响，探讨处理标签不确定性的方法。

Result: 研究表明，训练过程中标签的构建方式会显著影响模型行为，标签不确定性是AI与法律领域需要关注的重要问题。

Conclusion: 法律机器学习应用必须考虑标签不确定性，虽然存在估算方法，但都基于无法验证的假设。标签不确定性应被视为AI与法律领域的关键考量因素。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically
operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth.
However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not
captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from
a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label
indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or
had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to
account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these
indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In
the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we
show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly
affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant
concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个用于多模态虚假信息检测的代理框架，通过分解验证过程为四个模块：视觉真实性评估、跨模态一致性分析、检索增强的事实核查和校准判断，无需领域特定训练数据即可达到监督检测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络平台上每天有数十亿结合文本和图像的多模态帖子传播虚假信息，超出人工事实核查能力。监督检测模型需要领域特定训练数据且难以泛化到不同的操纵策略。

Method: MIRAGE框架将多模态验证分解为四个顺序模块：视觉真实性评估检测AI生成图像，跨模态一致性分析识别上下文错配，检索增强事实核查通过迭代问题生成基于网络证据验证声明，校准判断模块整合所有信号。

Result: 在MMFakeBench验证集上，MIRAGE与GPT-4o-mini组合达到81.65% F1分数和75.1%准确率，比最强的零样本基线高出7.65个F1点，同时保持34.3%的假阳性率。测试集结果确认了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 分解的代理推理与网络检索相结合，无需领域特定训练即可匹配监督检测器性能，在标记数据稀缺的多模态场景中实现虚假信息检测。

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily
multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual
fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific
training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We
present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that
decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual
veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency
analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual
checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation,
and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates
vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured
and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),
MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming
the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65
points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a
judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization
with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification
contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97
points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web
retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific
training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled
data remains scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成不仅需要准确的标记预测，更需要理解解决方案级别的结构关系。大型语言模型具备复杂推理能力，但部署成本高；小模型缺乏这种推理能力。

Method: 通过结构感知损失优化方法，训练小模型模仿大型语言模型的推理和问题解决能力，学习识别正确解决方案路径，建立问题定义与潜在解决方案之间的结构对应关系。

Conclusion: 通过廉价且易于实现的蒸馏过程，成功将大型语言模型的推理能力转移到小模型中，使其能够超越标记级生成，深入理解解决方案的整体结构。

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生需要实时工作并能解释选择的排名系统。需要低延迟、基于解码器的重排序器。

Method: 使用单解码器方法，结合池化首词评分信号和不确定性门控解释步骤。通过一次处理对所有候选进行评分，仅在列表真正模糊时生成简短的结构化理由。采用专注于困难案例的课程训练。

Result: 在遭遇范围订单选择上表现强劲（快速路径：Recall@1~0.45，nDCG@20~0.625），门控激活时进一步改善（Recall@1~0.56，nDCG@20~0.699，门控率45%）。紧凑骨干网络在相同策略下显示类似增益。编码器基线在效果和灵活性上都落后。

Conclusion: OG-Rank提供了一个实用方案：默认快速排名，在有助于时进行解释。这种模式适用于选择性生成能在可接受成本下提高准确性的决策任务。单策略设计简化了部署和预算规划，课程原则（在困难案例上投入更多，在简单案例上投入更少）可广泛应用于临床订单选择之外。

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify
their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker,
we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token
scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all
candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when
the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a
curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong
effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,
nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,
nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains
under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and
flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain
when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective
generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design
simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend
more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond
clinical order selection.

Result: 许多LLM已展现出令人印象深刻的预测能力，表现为较小的校准误差、一致的预测置信度和有前景的市场回报。但也发现了关键瓶颈。

Conclusion: LLMs在预测智能方面具有潜力，但需要解决事件回忆不准确、数据源误解以及信息聚合速度较慢等瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when
resolution nears.

Motivation: 在大规模多智能体强化学习中，人类对整个系统的全局指导不切实际，而现有的协调机制设计主要依赖经验研究，缺乏易用的研究工具。

Method: 引入多智能体影响图(MAIDs)作为分析框架，设计了针对性干预范式，仅对单个目标智能体进行干预，并采用预策略干预(PSI)因果推理技术来实现该范式。

Result: 实验证明了所提出的针对性干预方法的有效性，并验证了相关性图分析的结果。

Conclusion: MAIDs提供了一个有效的图形框架来分析和可视化MARL方法，针对性干预范式能够缓解全局指导问题，PSI技术能够通过最大化因果效应来实现复合期望结果。

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards
desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a
human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On
the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on
empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ
multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the
above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to
analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new
interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that
is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance
can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference
technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the
targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class
of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary
task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the
corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance
graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning
paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted
intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

Conclusion: HyCAM框架有效解决了LLM多任务适应问题，在保持效率的同时实现了更好的性能平衡

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现良好，但即使存在正确的视觉证据时仍会失败。本研究旨在系统性地探究这些失败是由于未能感知证据还是未能有效利用证据。

Method: 通过分析层间注意力动态，发现浅层主要关注文本，深层稀疏但可靠地关注局部证据区域。提出基于选择性注意力掩码的推理时干预方法。

Result: 发现VLMs在输出错误答案时通常已感知到视觉证据，这种现象广泛存在于主要VLM家族中。干预方法在LLaVA、Qwen、Gemma和InternVL等多个模型上一致提高了准确性。

Conclusion: VLMs内部编码了可靠的证据但未能充分利用，使这些信号显式化可以弥合感知与推理之间的差距，推进对VLM的诊断理解和可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such
as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct
visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether
these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it
effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow
layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably
attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the
visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term
``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building
on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer
evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no
training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including
LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable
evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can
bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic
understanding and reliability of VLMs.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的椭圆周长近似公式，通过改进Ramanujan第二公式，在b/a从1到1/10000范围内实现非常稳定的近似，最大相对误差仅约0.57 ppm。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 椭圆周长没有精确的初等函数闭式表达式，现有近似方法在精度和计算复杂度之间存在权衡，需要开发更精确且简洁的近似公式。

Method: 通过将Ramanujan第二公式除以1减去两个指数项的二项式，得到新的闭式表达式，仅需四个常数。

Result: 在b/a∈[0.0001,1]范围内，最大相对误差约为0.57 ppm，比Cantrell近似误差降低25倍，在圆形和退化椭圆极限情况下准精确。

Conclusion: 该方法是目前文献中最简单且最准确的椭圆周长闭式单行近似之一，在简洁性和精度之间实现了卓越平衡。

Abstract: The perimeter of an ellipse has no exact closed-form expression in terms of
elementary functions, and numerous approximations have been proposed since the
eighteenth century. Classical formulas by Fagnano, Euler, and Ramanujan, as
well as modern refinements such as Cantrell and Koshy methods, aim to reduce
the approximation error while maintaining computational simplicity. In this
paper, we introduce a new closed-form expression that enhances Ramanujan second
formula by dividing it by 1 minus a binomial of two exponential terms resulting
in a very stable approximation in a range of b/a between 1 and 1/10000, or even
up to a smaller ratio. The resulting approximation remains compact, requiring
only four constants, and achieving a remarkable tradeoff between simplicity and
accuracy. Across the full eccentricity range of b/a in [0.0001,1], our method
attains a maximum relative error of approximately 0.57 ppm with respect to the
exact perimeter computed via elliptic integral. Our formula is quasi-exact at
the extremes, for the circle b/a=1 and for the degenerate flat ellipse b/a=0.
Compared with Cantrell approximation, the proposed method reduces the maximum
relative error by a factor of 25 while preserving a short and elegant
expression. This makes it one of the simplest yet most accurate closed-form and
single-line approximations to the ellipse perimeter currently available in the
literature.

Abstract: This work considers the iterative solution of large-scale problems subject to
non-symmetric matrices or operators arising in discretizations of
(port-)Hamiltonian partial differential equations. We consider problems
governed by an operator $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{H}+\mathcal{S}$ with symmetric
part $\mathcal{H}$ that is positive (semi-)definite and skew-symmetric part
$\mathcal{S}$. Prior work has shown that the structure and sparsity of the
associated linear system enables Krylov subspace solvers such as the
generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) or short recurrence variants such
as Widlund's or Rapoport's method using the symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$, or an
approximation of it, as preconditioner. In this work, we analyze the resulting
condition numbers, which are crucial for fast convergence of these methods, for
various partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in diffusion phenomena,
fluid dynamics, and elasticity. We show that preconditioning with the symmetric
part leads to a condition number uniform in the mesh size in case of elliptic
and parabolic PDEs where $\mathcal{H}^{-1}\mathcal{S}$ is a bounded operator.
Further, we employ the tailored Krylov subspace methods in optimal control by
means of a condensing approach and a constraint preconditioner for the
optimality system. We illustrate the results by various large-scale numerical
examples and discuss efficient evaluations of the preconditioner, such as
incomplete Cholesky factorization or the algebraic multigrid method.

Abstract: In a recent paper~\cite{paper2}, we proposed the concept of optimal error
bounds for an iterative process, which allows us to obtain the convergence
result of the iterative sequence to the common fixed point of the nonexpansive
mappings in Banach spaces. Moreover, we also achieve the comparison results
between different iterative processes via optimal error bounds. In this paper,
we continue to determine optimal error bounds for more general iterative
processes which were studied by many authors, such as in~\cite{DungHieu} and
references therein. From there, the convergence results are obtained and the
convergence rates of these iterative processes are determined under some
sufficient conditions on sequences of parameters.

Abstract: A Euler's type method with the equidistant step size is proposed for a class
of time-changed stochastic differential equations driven by the multiplicative
noise and the strong convergence rate that is related to the parameter of the
time changing process is obtained. Such a observation of the convergence rate
is significantly different from those existing results that employ methods with
the random step size. The polynomial stability in the mean square sense of the
numerical method is also studied, which is in line with the asymptotic behavior
of the underlying equation.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种多层水平集方法(MLSM)用于基于程函方程的首波走时层析成像，能够通过多个水平集表示多个相和界面，改进了传统仅依赖零水平集的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统水平集方法仅使用零水平集，难以有效表示多个相和复杂界面结构。需要一种能够同时表示多个相和子区域的水平集方法，以提高复杂不连续速度模型的反演能力。

Method: 使用多层水平集表示多个相，每个i_n水平集附近函数表现为局部符号距离函数。在欧拉框架下计算程函方程的粘性解，通过伴随状态法获取失配函数的Fréchet导数，并采用多层重新初始化、弧长惩罚和Sobolev平滑等正则化策略。

Conclusion: 多层水平集方法为基于程函方程的首波走时层析成像提供了一种有效的框架，能够处理多个相和复杂界面，为复杂地质结构的速度模型反演提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel multilayer level-set method (MLSM) for eikonal-based
first-arrival traveltime tomography. Unlike classical level-set approaches that
rely solely on the zero-level set, the MLSM represents multiple phases through
a sequence of $i_n$-level sets ($n = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$). Near each $i_n$-level
set, the function is designed to behave like a local signed-distance function,
enabling a single level-set formulation to capture arbitrarily many interfaces
and subregions. Within this Eulerian framework, first-arrival traveltimes are
computed as viscosity solutions of the eikonal equation, and Fr\'{e}chet
derivatives of the misfit are obtained via the adjoint state method. To
stabilize the inversion, we incorporate several regularization strategies,
including multilayer reinitialization, arc-length penalization, and Sobolev
smoothing of model parameters. In addition, we introduce an illumination-based
error measure to assess reconstruction quality. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MLSM efficiently recovers complex discontinuous
slowness models with multiple phases and interfaces.

Abstract: We consider a time-space fractional diffusion equation with a variable
coefficient and investigate the inverse problem of reconstructing the source
term, after regularizing the problem with the quasiboundary value method to
mitigate the ill-posedness. The equation involves a Caputo fractional
derivative in the space variable and a tempered fractional derivative in the
time variable, both of order in (0, 1). A finite difference approximation leads
to a two-by-two block linear system of large dimensions. We conduct a spectral
analysis of the associated matrix sequences, employing tools from Generalized
Locally Toeplitz (GLT) theory, and construct the preconditioner guided by the
GLT analysis. Numerical experiments are reported and commented, followed by
concluding remarks.

Conclusion: 所提出的数值格式能够无条件保持最大有界原理和能量稳定性，即使在退化移动性情况下也保持能量稳定性，且计算效率高。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate linear first- and second-order numerical
schemes for the Allen--Cahn equation with a general (possibly degenerate)
mobility. Compared with existing numerical methods, our schemes employ a novel
dynamic stabilization approach that guarantees unconditional preservation of
the maximum bound principle (MBP) and energy stability. A key advance is that
the discrete energy stability remains valid even in the presence of degenerate
mobility-a property we refer to as mobility robustness. Rigorous maximum-norm
error estimates are also established. In particular, for the second-order
scheme, we introduce a new prediction strategy with a cut-off preprocessing
procedure on the extrapolation solution, and only one linear system needs to be
solved per time level. Representative numerical examples are provided to
validate the theoretical findings and performance of the proposed schemes.

Motivation: 提高相变材料太阳能烟囱出口气流速度的估计精度，通过有限温度测量重建动态温度场，为近实时热状态估计和数字孪生开发提供支持。

Method: 采用正则化最小二乘公式估计温度分布，结合从高保真有限体积模拟导出的降阶模型和三个实验数据集(22、135、203个测量点)，使用边界层和双三次插值的混合填充方案重建缺失数据。

Conclusion: 这是ROM-DA框架首次应用于耦合多物理场相变材料太阳能烟囱，展示了其在近实时热状态估计和数字孪生开发方面的潜力。

Abstract: This study evaluates a data assimilation framework based on reduced-order
modeling (ROM-DA), complemented by a hybrid data-filling strategy, to
reconstruct dynamic temperature fields in a phase-change-material (PCM)
integrated solar chimney from limited temperature measurements. The goal is to
enhance the estimation accuracy of the outlet airflow velocity. A regularized
least-squares formulation is employed to estimate temperature distributions
within an inclined solar chimney using RT-42 as the PCM. The methodology
combines (i) a reduced-order model derived from high-fidelity finite-volume
simulations of unsteady conjugate heat transfer with liquid-solid phase change
and surface radiation, and (ii) three experimental datasets with 22, 135, and
203 measurement points. Missing data are reconstructed using a hybrid filling
scheme based on boundary-layer and bicubic interpolations. The assimilated
temperature fields are integrated into the thermally coupled forward solver to
improve velocity predictions. Results show that the ROM-DA framework
reconstructs the transient temperature fields in both the air and PCM domains
with relative errors below 10 percent for sparse data and below 3 percent for
expanded datasets. When applied to experimental measurements, the approach
enhances the fidelity of temperature and velocity fields compared with the
baseline model, reducing the outlet velocity RMS error by 20 percent. This
represents the first application of a ROM-DA framework to a coupled
multiphysics solar chimney with PCM integration, demonstrating its potential
for near-real-time thermal state estimation and digital-twin development.

introduce several algorithms that combine the Schur decomposition with either
the matrix square root or the Cholesky factorization. We study the numerical
behavior of these algorithms in floating-point arithmetic, assess their
computational costs, and compare their numerical performance. Our analysis
suggests that the algorithms based on the Cholesky factorization will be more
accurate and efficient than those based on the matrix square root. This is
confirmed by our numerical experiments.

Conclusion: 成功开发了时间高阶参数有限元方法，能够准确高效地模拟固态去湿过程，同时保持长期网格均匀分布特性。

Abstract: We propose a class of temporally high-order parametric finite element methods
for simulating solid-state dewetting of thin films in two dimensions using a
sharp-interface model. The process is governed by surface diffusion and contact
point migration, along with appropriate boundary conditions. By incorporating
the predictor-corrector strategy and the backward differentiation formula for
time discretization into the energy-stable parametric finite element method
developed by Zhao et al. (2021), we successfully construct temporally
high-order schemes. The resulting numerical scheme is semi-implicit, requiring
the solution of a linear system at each time step. The well-posedness of the
fully discretized system is established. Moreover, the method maintains the
long-term mesh equidistribution property. Extensive numerical experiments
demonstrate that our methods achieve the desired temporal accuracy, measured by
the manifold distance, while maintaining good mesh quality throughout the
evolution.

Abstract: As a variational phase-field model, the time-fractional Allen-Cahn (TFAC)
equation enjoys the maximum bound principle (MBP) and a variational energy
dissipation law. In this work, we develop and analyze linear,
structure-preserving time-stepping schemes for TFAC, including first-order and
$\min\{1+\alpha, 2-\alpha\}$-order L1 discretizations, together with fast
implementations based on the sum-of-exponentials (SOE) technique. A central
feature of the proposed linear schemes is their unconditional preservation of
both the discrete MBP and the variational energy dissipation law on general
temporal meshes, including graded meshes commonly used for these problems.
Leveraging the MBP of the numerical solutions, we establish sharp error
estimates by employing the time-fractional Gro\"nwall inequality. Finally,
numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed schemes with an adaptive time-stepping strategy.

Conclusion: 该方法实现简单，在多种问题上表现良好，为隐式项延迟提供了理论框架，为进一步研究奠定了基础

Abstract: This work proposes a general strategy for solving possibly nonlinear problems
arising from implicit time discretizations as a sequence of explicit solutions.
The resulting sequence may exhibit instabilities similar to those of the base
explicit scheme, which can be mitigated through Anderson acceleration. The
approach uses explicit fixed-point subiterations for nonlinear problems,
combined with Anderson acceleration to improve convergence and computational
efficiency. Its usability and scalability are verified on three nonlinear
differential equations. An error analysis is presented to establish the
expected properties of the proposed strategy for both time and space-time
formulations. Several examples illustrate the simplicity of the implementation
and reveal the influence of parameter choices. The method proves simple to
implement and performs well across a range of problems, particularly when
matrix assembly is expensive or a good preconditioner for the implicit system
is unavailable, such as in highly convective fluid flows. This work formalizes
the delay of implicit terms in time discretization, provides a concise error
analysis, and enhances the approach using Anderson acceleration. The results
are encouraging and well supported by existing theory, laying the groundwork
for further research.

TL;DR: 提出了一类统一的Milstein型离散化方法，用于处理具有超线性增长漂移和扩散系数的McKean-Vlasov随机微分方程，在温和正则性假设下建立了相关粒子系统的一阶强收敛性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用中的MV-SDE具有超线性增长的漂移和扩散项，经典方法可能发散并导致粒子损坏，需要开发能够处理这种情况的数值方法。

Method: 开发了统一的Milstein型离散化框架，包括tamed-、tanh-和sine-Milstein方法作为特例，使用离散时间论证和二项式展开进行分析。

Result: 在仅要求系数一次可微的温和正则性假设下，建立了相关粒子系统的一阶强收敛性，数值实验验证了收敛行为。

Conclusion: 提出的Milstein型框架成功处理了超线性增长系数，提供了严格的收敛理论，补充了现有文献中仅数值测试而无理论保证的Euler格式。

Abstract: In the study of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs),
numerical approximation plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of
interacting particle systems (IPS). Classical Milstein schemes provide strong
convergence of order one under globally Lipschitz coefficients. Nevertheless,
many MV-SDEs arising from applications possess super-linearly growing drift and
diffusion terms, where classical methods may diverge and particle corruption
can occur. In the present work, we aim to fill this gap by developing a unified
class of Milstein-type discretizations handling both super-linear drift and
diffusion coefficients. The proposed framework includes the tamed-, tanh-, and
sine-Milstein methods as special cases and establishes order-one strong
convergence for the associated interacting particle system under mild
regularity assumptions, requiring only once differentiable coefficients. In
particular, our results complement Chen et al. (Electron. J. Probab., 2025),
where a taming-based Euler scheme was only tested numerically without
theoretical guarantees, by providing a rigorous convergence theory within a
broader Milstein-type framework. The analysis relies on discrete-time arguments
and binomial-type expansions, avoiding the continuous-time It\^o approach that
is standard in the literature. Numerical experiments are presented to
illustrate the convergence behavior and support the theoretical findings.

Abstract: In this work, we consider a class of linear ill-posed problems with operators
that map from the sequence space $ \ell_r $ ($r \ge 1$) into a Banach space and
in addition satisfy a conditional stability estimate in the scale of sequence
spaces $ \ell_q, \, q \ge 0 $. For the regularization of such problems in the
presence of deterministic noise, we consider variational regularization with a
penalty functional either of the form $ \mathcal{R} =\Vert \cdot \Vert_p^p $
for some $ p > 0 $ or in form of the counting measure $\mathcal{R}_0 = \Vert
\cdot \Vert_0 $. The latter case guarantees sparsity of the corresponding
regularized solutions. In this framework, we present first stability and then
convergence rates for suitable a priori parameter choices. The results cover
the oversmoothing situation, where the desired solution does not belong to the
domain of definition of the considered penalty functional. The analysis of the
oversmoothing case utilizes auxiliary elements that are defined by means of
hard thresholding. Such technique can also be used for post processing to
guarantee sparsity.

Conclusion: 所提出的无散混合有限元方法成功解决了四阶相场耦合活性流体方程的数值模拟问题，具有良好的计算效率和精度。

Abstract: This paper addresses the divergence-free mixed finite element method (FEM)
for nonlinear fourth-order Allen-Cahn phase field coupled active fluid
equations. By introducing an auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$, the original
fourth-order problem is converted into a system of second-order equations,
thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-comforming
finite element spaces. To further refine the formulation, an additional
auxiliary variable $\xi$, analogous to the pressure, is introduced, resulting
in a mixed finite element scheme that preserves the divergence-free condition
in $which = \Delta u$ inherited from the model. A fully discrete scheme is then
established by combining the spatial approximation by the divergence-free mixed
finite element method with the variable-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN)
time integrator. The boundedness of the scheme is rigorously derived under
suitable regularity assumptions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping
strategy based on the minimum dissipation criterion is carried out to enhance
computational efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the
theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in
simulating complex active fluid dynamics.

Result: 数值实验在合成和真实数据上验证了HOQRI算法的有效性

Conclusion: HOQRI算法为大规模稀疏张量的低多线性秩逼近提供了一种高效、内存友好的替代方案

Abstract: We propose a new algorithm called higher-order QR iteration (HOQRI) for
computing low multilinear rank approximation (LMLRA), also known as the Tucker
decomposition, of large and sparse tensors. Compared to the celebrated
higher-order orthogonal iterations (HOOI), HOQRI relies on a simple
orthogonalization step in each iteration rather than a more sophisticated
singular value decomposition step as in HOOI. More importantly, when dealing
with extremely large and sparse data tensors, HOQRI completely eliminates the
intermediate memory explosion by defining a new sparse tensor operation called
TTMcTC (short for tensor times matrix chains times core). Furthermore,
recognizing that the orthonormal constraints form a Cartesian product of
Stiefel manifolds, we introduce the framework of manifold optimization and show
that HOQRI guarantees convergence to the set of stationary points. Numerical
experiments on synthetic and real data showcase the effectiveness of HOQRI.

Motivation: 针对那些原则上可用PDE描述但缺乏显式模型的复杂系统，特别是质量守恒系统（如计算流体动力学和人群动力学），开发数据驱动的降阶建模方法，无需识别控制方程。

Method: 结合Takens/Whitney嵌入定理，使用延迟坐标通过流形学习获得系统演化的潜在空间表示。采用线性（POD）和非线性（扩散映射）方法提取低维嵌入，在潜在空间中学习预测ROM，并通过POD和k-NN提升算子将演化提升回原始高维空间。

Result: 结果表明，基于扩散映射的非线性嵌入在重构精度上优于POD，产生更简洁稳定的ROM，在长时间范围内保持准确性和可积性。两种提升算子都能保持质量守恒这一关键物理约束。

Conclusion: 该框架有效重构了底层PDE的解算子而无需发现PDE本身，通过流形知情的客观映射桥接多个尺度，为质量约束复杂系统的建模提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce a machine learning framework for modeling the spatio-temporal
dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose behavior
can, in principle, be described by PDEs but lack explicit models. The method
extends the Equation-Free approach, enabling the data-driven reconstruction of
reduced-order models (ROMs) without needing to identify governing equations.
Using manifold learning, we obtain a latent space representation of system
evolution from data via delayed coordinates, in accordance with
Takens/Whitney's embedding theorems. Linear (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition,
POD) and nonlinear (Diffusion Maps, DMs) methods are employed to extract
low-dimensional embeddings that capture the essential dynamics. Predictive ROMs
are then learned within this latent space, and their evolution is lifted back
to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We show
that both POD and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) lifting operators preserve mass, a
key physical constraint in systems such as computational fluid dynamics and
crowd dynamics. Our framework effectively reconstructs the solution operator of
the underlying PDE without discovering the PDE itself, by leveraging a
manifold-informed objective map that bridges multiple scales. For our
illustrations, we use synthetic spatio-temporal data from the Hughes model,
which couples a continuity PDE with an Eikonal equation describing optimal path
selection in crowds. Results show that DM-based nonlinear embeddings outperform
POD in reconstruction accuracy, producing more parsimonious and stable ROMs

Abstract: In this paper, we mainly discuss the convergence behavior of diffuse domain
method (DDM) for solving semilinear parabolic equations with Neumann boundary
condition defined in general irregular domains. We use a phasefield function to
approximate the irregular domain and when the interface thickness tends to
zero, the phasefield function will converge to indicator function of the
original domain. With this function, we can modify the problem to another one
defined on a larger rectangular domain that contains the targer physical
domain. Based on the weighted Sobolev spaces, we prove that when the interface
thickness parameter goes to zero, the numerical solution will converge to the
exact solution. Also, we derive the corresponding optimal error estimates under
the weighted L2 and H1 norms. Some numerical experiments are also carried out
to validate the theoretical results.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in the world, driving
the development of patient-specific and benchmark models for blood flow
analysis. This chapter provides a theoretical overview of the main categories
of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), focusing on both projection-based and
data-driven approaches within a classical setup. We then present a hybrid ROM
tailored for simulating blood flow in a patient-specific aortic geometry. The
proposed methodology integrates projection-based techniques with neural
network-enhanced data-driven components, incorporating a lifting function
strategy to enforce physiologically realistic outflow pressure conditions. This
hybrid methodology enables a substantial reduction in computational cost while
mantaining high fidelity in reconstructing both velocity and pressure fields.
We compare the full- and reduced-order solutions in details and critically
assess the advantages and limitations of ROMs in patient-specific
cardiovascular modeling.

Abstract: In \emph{Wang et al., A Shifted Laplace Rational Filter for Large-Scale
Eigenvalue Problems}, the SLRF method was proposed to compute all eigenvalues
of a symmetric definite generalized eigenvalue problem lying in an interval on
the real positive axis. The current paper discusses a parallel implementation
of this method, abbreviated as ParaSLRF. The parallelization consists of two
levels: (1) on the highest level, the application of the rational filter to the
various vectors is partitioned among groups of processors; (2) within each
group, every linear system is solved in parallel.
  In ParaSLRF, the linear systems are solved by iterative methods instead of
direct ones, in contrast to other rational filter methods, such as, PFEAST.
Because of the specific selection of poles in ParaSLRF, the computational cost
of solving the associated linear systems for each pole, is almost the same.
This intrinsically leads to a better load balance between each group of
resources, and reduces waiting times of processes.
  We show numerical experiments from finite element models of mechanical
vibrations, and show a detailed parallel performance analysis. ParaSLRF shows
the best parallel efficiency, compared to other rational filter methods based
on quadrature rules for contour integration. To further improve performance,
the converged eigenpairs are locked, and a good initial guess of iterative
linear solver is proposed. These enhancements of ParaSLRF show good two-level
strong scalability and excellent load balance in our experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, a finite volume approximation scheme is used to solve a
non-local macroscopic material flow model in two space dimensions, accounting
for the presence of boundaries in the non-local terms. Based on a previous
result for the scalar case, we extend the setting to a system of heterogeneous
material on bounded domains. We prove the convergence of the approximate
solutions constructed using the Roe scheme with dimensiona splitting, where the
major challenge lies in the treatment of the discontinuity occurring in the
flux function. Numerical tests show a good agreement with microscopic
simulations.

Abstract: Randomized Krylov subspace methods that employ the sketch-and-solve paradigm
to substantially reduce orthogonalization cost have recently shown great
promise in speeding up computations for many core linear algebra tasks (e.g.,
solving linear systems, eigenvalue problems and matrix equations, as well as
approximating the action of matrix functions on vectors) whenever a
nonsymmetric matrix is involved. An important application that requires
approximating the action of matrix functions on vectors is the implementation
of exponential integration schemes for ordinary differential equations. In this
paper, we specifically analyze randomized Krylov methods from this point of
view. In particular, we use the residual of the underlying differential
equation to derive a new, reliable a posteriori error estimate that can be used
to monitor convergence and decide when to stop the iteration. To do so, we
first develop a very general framework for Krylov ODE residuals that unifies
existing results, simplifies their derivation and allows extending the concept
to a wide variety of methods beyond randomized Arnoldi (e.g., rational Krylov
methods, Krylov methods using a non-standard inner product, ...). In addition,
we discuss certain aspects regarding the efficient implementation of sketched
Krylov methods. Numerical experiments on large-scale ODE models from real-world
applications illustrate the quality of the error estimate as well as the
general competitiveness of sketched Krylov methods for ODEs in comparison to
other Krylov-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在笛卡尔网格上求解泊松方程时，边界附近电荷密度采样不准确导致的右端项误差如何影响数值精度，这一问题在PIC方法中尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用嵌入边界有限差分法，通过一维解析推导和二维截断误差分析，比较线性和二次处理方案的误差特性，并进行一维、二维和三维数值实验验证。

Result: 右端项误差对两种方案影响不同：线性方案中减少主导截断误差，而二次方案中引入零阶项导致更大全局误差。线性方案在典型PIC误差下整体精度更优。

Conclusion: 提出了简单的右端项校准策略来恢复二次方案的精度，为泊松类问题中边界诱导的右端项误差与离散精度之间的相互作用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations rely on accurate solutions of the
electrostatic Poisson equation, yet accuracy often deteriorates near irregular
Dirichlet boundaries on Cartesian meshes. While much research has addressed
discretization errors on the left-hand side (LHS) of the Poisson equation, the
impact of right-hand-side (RHS) inaccuracies - arising from charge density
sampling near boundaries in PIC methods - remains largely unexplored. This
study analyzes the numerical errors induced by underestimated RHS values at
near-boundary nodes when solving the Poisson equation using embedded boundary
finite difference schemes with linear and quadratic treatments. Analytical
derivations in one dimension and truncation error analyses in two dimensions
reveal that such RHS inaccuracies modify local truncation behavior differently:
they reduce the dominant truncation error in the linear scheme but introduce a
zeroth-order term in the quadratic scheme, leading to larger global errors.
Numerical experiments in one-, two-, and three-dimensional domains confirm
these findings. Contrary to expectations, the linear scheme yields superior
overall accuracy under typical PIC-induced RHS inaccuracies. A simple RHS
calibration strategy is further proposed to restore the accuracy of the
quadratic scheme. These results offer new insight into the interplay between
boundary-induced RHS errors and discretization accuracy in Poisson-type
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典Nyström方法中解节点和积分节点耦合，限制了方法的灵活性和效率，特别是在窄核情况下。论文旨在通过解耦这两个节点集来提高方法的性能。

Method: 使用最近发展的无矩无网格散点积分公式，在解节点和积分节点之间建立重建方案来近似积分节点处的值。

Result: 与经典Nyström方法相比，解耦变体具有明显的性能优势，特别是对于窄核情况。证明了在自然假设下，整体收敛阶是积分方案和重建方案收敛阶的最小值。

Conclusion: 解耦Nyström方法为第二类Fredholm积分方程的数值求解提供了更高效和灵活的选择，特别是在处理复杂几何和窄核问题时。

Abstract: The Nystr\"om method for the numerical solution of Fredholm integral
equations of the second kind is generalized by decoupling the set of solution
nodes from the set of quadrature nodes. The accuracy and efficiency of the new
method is investigated for smooth kernels and complex 2D domains using recently
developed moment-free meshless quadrature formulas on scattered nodes. Compared
to the classical Nystr\"om method, our variant has a clear performance
advantage, especially for narrow kernels. The decoupled Nystr\"om method
requires the choice of a reconstruction scheme to approximate values at
quadrature nodes from values at solution nodes. We prove that, under natural
assumptions, the overall order of convergence is the minimum between that of
the quadrature scheme and of the reconstruction scheme.

Abstract: This paper presents low-complexity tensor completion algorithms and their
efficient implementation to reconstruct highly oscillatory operators
discretized as $n\times n$ matrices. The underlying tensor decomposition is
based on the reshaping of the input matrix and its butterfly decomposition into
an order $\mathcal{O} (\log n)$ tensor. The reshaping of the input matrix into
a tensor allows for representation of the butterfly decomposition as a tensor
decomposition with dense tensors. This leads to efficient utilization of the
existing software infrastructure for dense and sparse tensor computations. We
propose two tensor completion algorithms in the butterfly format, using
alternating least squares and gradient-based optimization, as well as a novel
strategy that uses low-rank matrix completion to efficiently generate an
initial guess for the proposed algorithms. To demonstrate the efficiency and
applicability of our proposed algorithms, we perform three numerical
experiments using simulated oscillatory operators in seismic applications. In
these experiments, we use $\mathcal {O} (n \log n)$ observed entries in the
input matrix and demonstrate an $\mathcal{O}(n\log^3 n)$ computational cost of
the proposed algorithms, leading to a speedup of orders of magnitudes per
iteration for large matrices compared to the low-rank matrix and quantized
tensor-train completion. Moreover, the proposed butterfly completion
algorithms, equipped with the novel initial guess generation strategy, achieve
reconstruction errors that are smaller by an order of magnitude, enabling
accurate recovery of the underlying structure compared to the state-of-the-art
completion algorithms.

Abstract: I propose a vertex patch smoother where local problems are solved inexactly
by a nested, matrix-free p-multigrid, creating a multigrid-within-multigrid
framework. A single iteration of the local solver can be evaluated with
$\mathcal{O}(p^{d+1})$ operations, and the approach is applicable to
non-separable problems on unstructured meshes. Numerical experiments
demonstrate limited sensitivity to geometric distortion and high-contrast
coefficients. When used in a global geometric multigrid solver, the method
achieves robustness with respect to both polynomial degree $p$ and mesh
refinement, even on heavily distorted meshes.
