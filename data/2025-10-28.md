### [1] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU是一个用于诊断视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解任务中失败原因的任务套件，研究发现错误主要源于视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题，而非视觉编码本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在基本的数据可视化理解任务上表现不佳，但失败的具体原因尚不清楚，需要系统性地诊断是视觉信息编码、模块间信息传递还是语言处理环节的问题。

Method: 开发FUGU任务套件，使用激活修补和线性探针技术追踪信息流，分析三种广泛使用的视觉语言模型在不同提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型经常无法正确生成单个数据点的坐标，这些初始错误导致最终回答错误。当提供正确坐标时性能显著提升，但正确坐标可以从视觉编码器中读取，表明问题在于视觉-语言交接。对于需要统计关系的任务，提供坐标反而降低性能。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型存在架构限制，可能对可靠的数据可视化理解构成重大挑战，即使微调也无法达到理想性能。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [2] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的自一致性框架，通过语义聚类和余弦相似度共识机制，提高视觉语言模型在农业图像描述中的可靠性，在植物病害诊断任务上显著提升了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决发展中国家农业病害管理面临的专家资源有限、网络连接不可靠和成本约束等问题，需要开发轻量级且可靠的AI系统来辅助农业病害诊断。

Method: 使用轻量级预训练嵌入模型进行语义聚类，通过余弦相似度选择最一致的图像描述，并加入人机交互环节让用户确认作物类型以过滤错误生成。

Result: 在PlantVillage数据集上，单聚类共识方法在10个候选生成时达到83.1%的准确率，优于贪婪解码的77.5%；多聚类方法在考虑前4个候选聚类时准确率提升至94.0%。

Conclusion: 该自一致性框架能有效提高视觉语言模型在农业图像描述任务中的可靠性，为资源受限环境下的农业病害管理提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

### [3] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两个专门用于艺术控制的ControlNet：比例ControlNet使用边界框控制物体位置和大小，透视ControlNet使用消失线控制场景3D几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像扩散模型生成高保真图像，但对输出的空间和几何结构控制有限。

Method: 开发了两个ControlNet模块，利用视觉语言模型进行数据标注，使用专门算法进行条件图像合成训练。

Result: 实验表明两个模块都能提供有效控制，但在复杂约束下存在局限性。

Conclusion: 两个模型已在HuggingFace发布，为艺术创作提供了更好的空间和几何控制能力。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [4] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow是一个无需人工标注、仅使用合成数据的3D人-物交互(HOI)框架，通过密集3D流表示学习接触、方向和空间占用等完整交互信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖人工标注数据集且仅限于接触分析的问题，需要更全面地理解人-物交互的方向偏好和空间占用等关键方面。

Method: 使用3D生成模型创建合成数据，通过点云上的密集扩散过程学习3D流表示，从而发现丰富的3D交互可能性。

Result: 通过大量评估表明，H2OFlow能有效泛化到真实世界物体，在3D交互建模方面超越了依赖人工标注或网格表示的方法。

Conclusion: H2OFlow证明了仅使用合成数据就能全面学习3D人-物交互的可行性，为计算机视觉和机器人学提供了新的无监督学习途径。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

### [6] [Face-MakeUpV2: Facial Consistency Learning for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21775)
*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2是一个面部图像生成模型，通过构建大规模数据集和引入3D面部渲染通道，解决了文本到图像模型中面部属性泄露和物理一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在响应局部语义指令时存在面部属性泄露和物理一致性不足的问题，需要开发能够保持面部ID和物理特征一致性的模型。

Method: 构建了包含100万图像-文本-掩码对的大规模数据集；使用通用文本到图像预训练模型作为主干；引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道；通过语义对齐和感知损失进行监督学习。

Result: 实验表明Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和参考图像物理一致性方面实现了最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2在可靠和可控的面部编辑方面具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

### [7] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究量化了紧凑二进制人脸模板的长期稳定性，发现64位和128位模板的年龄漂移分别为每十年1.357位和2.571位，表明随着时间推移类内距离会系统性增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究紧凑二进制人脸模板的纵向稳定性，量化年龄漂移对生物识别系统性能的影响，为智能卡和片上匹配部署提供指导。

Method: 使用现代人脸CNN提取浮点嵌入，通过PCA-ITQ压缩为64位和128位二进制码。对AgeDB数据库中每个身份构建所有真实配对，拟合汉明距离与绝对年龄差的线性模型。

Result: 在566个身份上，64位模板的年龄漂移中位数为每十年1.357位，128位模板为每十年2.571位。漂移分布主要为正值，表明类内距离随时间系统性增加。较短的代码在固定决策阈值下具有更好的年龄稳定性。

Conclusion: 二进制人脸模板存在系统性年龄漂移，较短的代码更稳定。建议采用定期重新注册和针对不稳定位位置的目标奇偶校验等简单缓解措施。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

### [8] [Bridging Accuracy and Interpretability: Deep Learning with XAI for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21780)
*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的深度学习框架，用于基于乳腺肿块细针穿刺图像的定量特征进行乳腺癌早期检测，在保持高准确率的同时提供模型解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学诊断中虽然性能优异，但其黑盒特性阻碍了临床采用。需要结合高性能和可解释性来满足临床需求。

Method: 使用ReLU激活函数、Adam优化器和二元交叉熵损失的深度神经网络，并结合SHAP和LIME等模型无关的可解释AI技术生成特征级归因和可视化。

Result: 实现了0.992的准确率、1.000的精确率、0.977的召回率和0.988的F1分数，显著优于文献基准和其他传统算法。细胞核凹点特征被发现是最具影响力的分类特征。

Conclusion: 该框架成功弥合了深度学习模型性能与可解释性之间的差距，为乳腺癌的临床诊断提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

### [9] [EdgeSync: Accelerating Edge-Model Updates for Data Drift through Adaptive Continuous Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21781)
*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync是一种高效的边缘模型更新方法，通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，解决实时视频分析中模型精度下降和更新延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频分析系统在边缘设备部署轻量模型以减少延迟，但数据特征分布会随时间变化（如光照、天气条件变化），导致模型精度下降。现有方法面临计算密集的重新训练过程导致更新延迟，以及新模型与当前视频流数据分布不匹配的问题。

Method: EdgeSync通过结合时效性和推理结果来增强样本过滤，确保训练样本与当前视频内容更相关；同时采用动态训练管理模块来优化模型更新的时机和顺序，提高时效性。

Result: 在多样化和复杂的真实世界数据集上的评估显示，EdgeSync相比现有方法准确率提高约3.4%，相比传统方法提高约10%。

Conclusion: EdgeSync通过高效的样本过滤和动态训练管理，显著提高了边缘模型更新的时效性和准确性，有效解决了实时视频分析中的模型适应性问题。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

### [10] [Promptable Fire Segmentation: Unleashing SAM2's Potential for Real-Time Mobile Deployment with Strategic Bounding Box Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21782)
*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面评估SAM2变体在火焰分割任务中的表现，重点研究边界框提示策略以提升部署可行性。研究发现边界框提示优于自动和单点方法，轻量级变体更适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割在计算机视觉中具有挑战性，而SAM/SAM2模型的跨域泛化能力在火焰分割特别是移动部署约束下的效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 系统评估四种SAM2.1变体和移动导向变体，使用多种提示策略（自动、单点、多点、边界框及混合策略）在三个火焰数据集上进行测试。

Result: 边界框提示方法表现最佳，Box+MP在Khan数据集上获得最高平均IoU(0.64)和Dice系数(0.75)。轻量级变体显著降低内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该研究为在火焰监控系统中部署可提示分割模型提供了关键见解，并为领域特定SAM应用建立了基准。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

### [11] [Noise Aggregation Analysis Driven by Small-Noise Injection: Efficient Membership Inference for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21783)
*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推理攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并评估噪声分布的聚合程度来区分训练集和非训练集样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的广泛使用带来了隐私风险，特别是成员推理攻击，即判断特定数据样本是否用于模型训练过程。

Method: 基于噪声注入和噪声分布聚合度评估。假设成员图像在扩散过程的某个时间步上表现出更高的预测噪声聚合度，而非成员图像的预测噪声则更离散。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上表现出优越性能，面对大规模文本到图像扩散模型时，在ASR和AUC指标上显示出更好的攻击效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法比现有方法需要更少的访问目标扩散模型次数，证明了该方法的可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

### [12] [Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cramér-Rao Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分渲染器的相机位姿估计协方差闭式下界方法，通过将渲染器作为测量函数，在流形上线性化图像形成过程，得到渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位姿估计在计算机视觉和机器人领域至关重要，但目前缺乏对密集或学习模型下位姿估计的严格不确定性量化方法。

Method: 将可微分渲染器视为测量函数，在流形上对小的位姿扰动进行图像形成过程的线性化，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。

Result: 该方法可简化为经典的捆绑调整不确定性，确保与视觉理论的连续性，并能自然地扩展到多智能体设置中通过融合不同相机的Fisher信息。

Conclusion: 这种统计公式在下游任务如协同感知和无需显式关键点对应关系的新视角合成中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

*Qile Su,Shoutai Zhu,Shuai Zhang,Baoyu Liang,Chao Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AVEP（动作中心视频事件预测）任务，区别于传统视频预测任务，专注于复杂逻辑和丰富语义信息的事件预测。作者构建了包含35K标注视频和178K视频片段的大型数据集，并提出EventFormer模型，在节点-图层次注意力机制下实现更好的事件预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类事件多以视频形式记录而非文本脚本，但在视觉领域缺乏相关研究。现有视频预测任务主要关注像素级或帧级预测，缺乏对复杂事件逻辑和语义结构的建模。

Method: 提出EventFormer模型，采用节点-图层次注意力机制，能够同时捕捉事件与参数之间的关系以及参数之间的共指关系。构建了包含35K标注视频和178K视频片段的大型结构化数据集，以多模态事件参数节点作为原子单元。

Result: 在AVEP任务上，EventFormer模型超越了多种SOTA视频预测模型和LVLMs，证明了该任务的复杂性和数据集的价值。

Conclusion: AVEP任务为视频事件预测提供了新的研究方向，EventFormer模型通过结构化的事件表示和层次注意力机制，在复杂事件预测任务中表现出色。数据集和代码将公开发布以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Motivation: 工业异常检测需要融合2D和3D数据，但跨模态融合仍然具有挑战性，需要更稳健的融合方法。

Method: 使用共享融合编码器从RGB图像和点云中合成统一潜在空间，然后通过注意力引导的模态特定解码器进行重建，通过重建误差定位异常。

Conclusion: MAFR为融合视觉和几何信息提供了原则性方法，提升了工业异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

TL;DR: TITA是一个轻量级框架，通过训练奖励模型来近似基础VLM的分布，在推理时提取隐式偏好信号作为对数概率比，提供密集的自回归反馈，从而减少幻觉并提高多模态理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型对齐方法通常依赖昂贵的微调或粗粒度的序列级推理策略，无法提供细粒度的即时反馈。

Method: 冻结基础VLM，训练奖励模型来近似其分布，在推理时通过奖励模型和目标VLM之间的对数概率比提取隐式偏好信号，提供词元级纠正信号。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得一致提升，MMVet提升8.6%，POPE提升6.7%，在幻觉减少和VQA准确性方面表现优异，且推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: TITA作为一种推理时对齐方法，能够有效减少视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高多模态理解能力，同时保持轻量级和高效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了HIBA（分层交错块注意力）架构和Xihe时间序列基础模型系列，通过分层稀疏注意力有效捕获多尺度时间依赖，在零样本迁移中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型直接采用跨领域架构，限制了有效捕获时间序列数据中固有的多尺度时间依赖，特别是在零样本迁移到具有不同模式和采样策略的数据集时表现不佳。

Method: 提出HIBA架构，使用分层交错块稀疏注意力：块内注意力促进局部信息交换，块间注意力跨块操作以捕获全局时间模式交互和动态演化。基于此构建了参数规模从950万到15亿的Xihe模型系列。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval基准测试中，最小的Xihe-tiny模型（950万参数）超越了大多数当代TSFMs，展示了卓越的参数效率。Xihe-max（15亿参数）建立了新的零样本性能最先进水平，大幅超越先前最佳结果。

Conclusion: 整个参数范围内的持续性能卓越证明了HIBA架构的卓越泛化能力和架构优越性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Conclusion: 将解剖结构纳入放射学分析对于准确评估膝骨关节炎严重程度至关重要。

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用两个并行采样器在有限去噪步骤下提升扩散模型采样质量的方法，该方法简单易用、无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限去噪步骤（即扩散模型评估次数有限）的情况下，如何提高采样图像的质量。

Method: 使用两个并行采样器在连续时间点进行去噪步骤，并适当整合它们的信息到潜在图像中。该方法即插即用、模型无关，无需额外微调或外部模型。

Result: 通过自动化和人工评估验证了该方法对不同扩散模型的有效性。发现简单的信息整合会降低采样质量，而增加更多并行采样器不一定能进一步提升质量。

Conclusion: 在有限去噪步骤下，两个并行采样器的适当信息整合能有效提升扩散模型的采样质量，但需要精心设计整合策略。

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

TL;DR: FDA-CLIP是一种基于CLIP的文本-视频检索框架，通过帧差生成动态区域掩码，引导模型关注关键动态语义区域，抑制静态背景冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法依赖大规模标注数据且存在模态鸿沟问题，现有CLIP适配方法缺乏对动态视频特征的增强和对静态冗余特征的有效抑制。

Method: 使用帧差生成动态区域掩码，作为Alpha通道输入Alpha-CLIP，主动引导模型关注语义关键动态区域，抑制静态背景冗余。

Result: 实验表明帧差引导的视频语义编码能有效平衡检索效率和准确性。

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP通过动态区域关注机制，在文本-视频检索任务中实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注成本高昂推动了数据有限场景下深度学习模型的研究。现有范式无法平衡跨领域迁移和跨类别泛化，催生了领域自适应零样本学习(DAZSL)的需求。虽然视觉语言模型(如CLIP)在DAZSL领域具有固有优势，但当前研究未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出了语义关系增强的CLIP(SRE-CLIP)适配器框架，包含语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，以解决CLIP在DAZSL中面临的两个核心挑战：缺乏语义关系指导导致的跨类别知识转移效率低下，以及目标域微调过程中的跨模态对齐退化。

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP框架通过有效利用语义关系和保持跨模态对齐，成功解决了CLIP在领域自适应零样本学习中的关键挑战，为数据有限场景下的模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

TL;DR: SITS-DECO是一个基于GPT风格解码器架构的生成式地球观测基础模型，通过统一序列框架处理多模态、多任务EO数据，无需特定任务或模态适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有EO基础模型需要额外适配、结构僵化的问题，借鉴大语言模型的统一序列处理思想，简化EO数据的使用。

Method: 采用GPT风格解码器架构，通过符号提示在单一统一架构中执行监督和自监督任务，利用密集时间序列建模。

Result: 在作物类型分类任务(PASTIS-R)上优于更大的EO基础模型，证明了密集时间序列建模的重要性。

Conclusion: 展示了数据为中心的建模范式，能力源于训练数据的多样性和结构而非架构复杂性，为未来生成式EO基础模型提供了概念桥梁。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

### [29] [Gestura: A LVLM-Powered System Bridging Motion and Semantics for Real-Time Free-Form Gesture Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21814)
*Zhuoming Li,Aitong Liu,Mengxi Jia,Tengxiang Zhang,Dell Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gestura是一个端到端的自由手势理解系统，通过预训练大视觉语言模型、手部关键点处理模块和思维链推理策略，显著提升了自由手势识别的准确性和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GestureGPT解决方案在手势识别准确性和响应时间方面存在局限，需要开发更高效的自由手势理解系统来改善人机交互体验。

Method: 使用预训练大视觉语言模型对齐手势与语义概念；引入手部关键点处理模块嵌入解剖学先验知识；采用思维链推理策略进行逐步语义推理。

Result: Gestura实现了稳健且适应性强的自由手势理解，并开发了首个包含30万标注问答对的开源自由手势意图推理数据集。

Conclusion: Gestura通过结合大视觉语言模型、手部关键点处理和思维链推理，有效解决了自由手势理解中的挑战，为人机交互提供了更自然的手势交互方式。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了ChatGPT4o/DALL-E3文本到图像生成模型在提示忠实度方面的表现，发现15.6%的属性未按提示正确渲染，其中人物年龄的描绘错误率最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估文本到图像生成模型是否能够准确地将提示中明确指定的属性渲染到生成的图像中，这对于检测模型偏见和评估模型性能具有重要意义。

Method: 使用两个公共数据集（200个文化创意产业女性工作者和230个博物馆策展人的可视化图像），评估了个人属性（年龄、头发）、外观（着装、眼镜）和随身物品（姓名标签、剪贴板）的渲染准确性。

Result: DALL-E3在所有属性中（n=710）有15.6%未按提示正确渲染。错误率最低的是随身物品，中等的是个人外观，最高的是人物本身的描绘，特别是年龄。

Conclusion: 研究发现文本到图像生成模型存在可测量的提示到图像忠实度差距，这对偏见检测和模型评估具有重要影响。

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波变换和ResNet50的GAN生成图像检测方法，通过Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器预处理图像，在频域中识别GAN图像的独特伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成图像的检测在数字图像取证中面临重大挑战，需要开发有效的检测方法来区分真实图像和GAN生成图像。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）预处理，应用Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器将图像转换为多分辨率表示，然后输入ResNet50网络进行分类。

Result: Haar和Daubechies预处理模型的准确率分别达到93.8%和95.1%，显著高于空间域模型的81.5%，Daubechies模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: GAN生成图像在小波域具有独特的伪影或'指纹'，小波域分析是检测GAN图像的有效方法，为未来深度伪造检测系统的发展提供了潜力。

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像诊断中潜力巨大，但缺乏可解释性阻碍了临床信任和采用，需要开发可解释的AI工具。

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet121在公开Kaggle数据集上训练，集成Grad-CAM生成热力图可视化，显示模型决策的关键区域。

Result: DenseNet121表现优于ResNet50：脑肿瘤检测准确率94.3% vs 92.5%，肺炎检测准确率89.1% vs 84.4%。Grad-CAM显示DenseNet121更专注于核心病理区域。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和可解释AI为开发可靠、可解释且临床有用的诊断工具提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决偏远病理实验室中高质量训练数据不足的问题，防止在低成本系统和低质量图像设置下的假阳性检测。

Method: 使用改进的AlexNet神经网络、SVM、K最近邻及其级联管道，结合可靠性阈值度量和工程特征，对半直染色体进行自动过滤。

Result: 对于常见缺陷和易位的染色体，分类精度显著提高超过90%，在极低质量G带数据库上获得高精度结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的阈值度量和剪枝方法适用于贫困国家和低预算病理实验室的核型分析设施。

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

Motivation: 解决当前多模态大语言模型在视觉模态抽象信息理解和推理方面的挑战，特别是针对多模态关系知识的结构化抽象推理任务缺乏高质量数据和能力增强方法的问题。

Method: 开发了自动STAR数据引擎合成含多模态关系知识的图像，构建包含可靠思维链的多模态指令数据；提出了两阶段能力增强训练框架和针对不同STAR任务的评估协议。

Result: 构建了包含64K高质量多模态指令样本的STAR-64K数据集，实验表明两阶段增强框架使3B/7B小模型在STAR任务上显著超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 提出的数据生成方法和训练框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型在结构化抽象推理任务上的性能，为多模态关系知识推理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

*Yi Yin,Yuntao Shou,Zao Dai,Yun Peng,Tao Meng,Wei Ai,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合低秩Transformer和基于流的生成模型的新框架，用于处理不完整多模态医学数据的生存分析，通过类别特定流进行跨模态分布对齐，提高缺失模态重建的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界多模态医学数据常存在模态不完整问题，现有方法直接推断缺失模态但忽略了模态间的分布差异，导致重建结果不一致不可靠。

Method: 使用类别特定流进行跨模态分布对齐，利用归一化流的可逆结构和精确密度建模能力构建分布一致的缺失模态潜在空间；设计轻量级低秩Transformer建模模态内依赖关系，缓解高维模态融合中的过拟合问题。

Result: 在完整模态设置下达到最先进性能，在不完整模态场景下保持鲁棒且优越的准确率。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理多模态生存分析中的模态不完整问题，通过分布对齐和低秩Transformer实现了鲁棒且灵活的多模态生存预测。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种垃圾图像分类方法：传统机器学习、深度学习和混合方法，发现混合方法在三个公开数据集上表现最佳，准确率高达100%，同时通过特征选择降低95%以上特征维度，实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化垃圾图像分类是全球废物管理的关键组成部分，但目前缺乏整合机器学习、深度学习和高效混合解决方案的系统性基准。

Method: 比较三种范式：(1) 基于手工特征的机器学习算法；(2) 深度学习架构（ResNet变体和EfficientNetV2S）；(3) 混合方法（深度模型特征提取+传统分类器如SVM和逻辑回归）。

Result: 混合方法在三个数据集上表现最优：TrashNet和精炼家庭垃圾数据集达到100%准确率，垃圾分类数据集达到99.87%，超越了现有最佳基准。特征选择使特征维度减少95%以上且不影响准确率。

Conclusion: 本研究为垃圾分类建立了更可靠的基准，并提出了一个高效的混合框架，在保持高精度的同时降低推理成本，适合在资源受限环境中进行可扩展部署。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在医学图像分类中的零样本能力，特别是GPT-4o在胸部X光片肺炎诊断中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用400张平衡测试图像（200张正常，200张肺炎），通过四种不同提示设计（从简单指令到详细推理提示）评估GPT-4o的零样本分类性能。

Result: 简洁的特征导向提示获得最高分类准确率74%，而推理导向提示表现较差。模型显示出医学图像解释的潜力，但诊断可靠性不足。

Conclusion: 虽然ChatGPT在医学图像解释方面显示出新兴潜力，但在安全应用于临床实践前，仍需在视觉推理和领域适应方面持续改进。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet通过可训练的理性小波变换前端增强TCFormer主干网络，在BCI-IV-2a和2b数据集上显著提升了最难被试者的分类准确率，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于运动想象的脑机接口面临非平稳性、低信噪比和个体差异等挑战，特别是在最难被试者上表现不佳。本文旨在测试小波前端是否能提升Transformer脑机接口在最困难情况下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出RatioWaveNet，包含理性小波变换前端（RDWT）进行多分辨率子带分解，结合CNN-Transformer主干（TCFormer）进行时空特征提取、长程上下文建模和因果时序整合。

Result: 在BCI-IV-2a和2b数据集上，RatioWaveNet相比Transformer主干在最差被试者准确率上分别提升0.17/0.42和1.07/2.54个百分点，平均性能也有稳定提升，计算开销适度。

Conclusion: 简单的可训练小波前端是增强Transformer脑机接口的有效插件，能够在不牺牲效率的情况下改善最差情况下的可靠性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前多模态模型中存在的系统性分离问题，即模型在视觉和文本模态之间表现不一致，这可能影响AI安全框架的有效性。

Method: 通过对照实验在合成数据集上测试多种架构，验证模态失语症现象的存在，并演示仅基于文本对齐的模型仍能生成不安全图像。

Result: 前沿模型能近乎完美地重现标志性电影艺术作品，但在文字描述中混淆关键细节；模态失语症是当前统一多模态模型的基本属性而非训练伪影。

Conclusion: 模态失语症是当前多模态模型的基本缺陷，可能导致AI安全漏洞，因为单一模态的安全防护无法阻止有害概念在其他模态中的传播。

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

### [42] [Poisson Flow Consistency Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21857)
*Anthony Zhang,Mahmut Gokmen,Dennis Hein,Rongjun Ge,Wenjun Xia,Ge Wang,Jin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT)方法，使PFCM能够独立训练而无需依赖预训练的PFGM++，在CT图像去噪任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM)只能通过蒸馏方式训练，这限制了其在多种数据模态中的应用潜力。

Method: 利用扰动核去除对预训练PFGM++的依赖，引入正弦离散化调度和Beta噪声分布来提高适应性和样本质量。

Result: 在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中，LPIPS和SSIM指标均有改善，去噪效果与Consistency Model等模型相当。

Conclusion: PFCT是一种有效的PFCM独立训练方法，为生成建模领域提供了更大的灵活性，未来需要进一步优化和扩展应用。

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段混合框架，用于自动解释2D多视图工程图纸，结合现代检测和视觉语言模型，实现布局分割、注释检测和语义内容解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程图纸解释面临复杂多视图布局、密集注释和混合符号文本内容的挑战，传统方法难以有效处理。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) YOLOv11-det进行布局分割；2) YOLOv11-obb进行方向感知的细粒度注释检测；3) 两个基于Donut的VLM分别处理文本和数值内容。

Result: 开发了两个专用数据集，Alphabetical VLM F1得分0.672，Numerical VLM F1得分0.963，在文本和数值解释方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可扩展的智能工程图纸分析解决方案，统一的JSON输出便于与CAD和制造数据库集成。

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSF-Animation是一个无需显式情感和身份标签的语音驱动3D面部动画框架，通过从语音中隐式提取情感信息和从中性面部网格中捕获身份特征，实现了对未见说话者和情感状态的更好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式的一热编码来表示身份和情感，限制了泛化能力，且忽略了语音中固有的情感线索，影响了动画的自然性和适应性。

Method: 提出LSF-Animation框架，隐式从语音提取情感信息，从中性面部网格捕获身份特征，并引入层次交互融合块(HIFB)来有效整合情感、运动和身份线索。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在情感表现力、身份泛化和动画真实感方面超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过消除对显式情感和身份特征的依赖，实现了更好的泛化能力和更自然的动画生成。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶车辆在罕见但安全关键的极端场景下运动预测性能不足的问题，现有模型因训练数据中常见场景过度代表和泛化能力有限而表现不佳。

Method: 构建紧凑场景表示，结合轻量级时间标记器将轨迹映射到LLM特征空间，使用混合专家(MoE)分解复杂场景，通过路由器分配场景给专业专家进行意图推断和反事实推演。

Result: 在四个基准数据集(nuScenes、NGSIM、HighD、MoCAD)上的广泛实验表明，WM-MoE始终优于最先进的基线方法，在极端场景和数据缺失条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的架构为自动驾驶车辆中稳健和可泛化的运动预测提供了前景，特别是在处理极端场景方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Conclusion: 证明了大型多模态模型极端量化的可行性，支持在资源受限设备上的有效高效部署

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive
modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency
computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can
achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and
image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work
highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning based generative models, particularly
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
Diffusion Models (DMs), have been instrumental in in generating diverse,
high-quality content across various domains, such as image and video synthesis.
This capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured
strong public interest. As they continue to advance at a rapid pace, the
growing volume of research, expanding application areas, and unresolved
technical challenges make it increasingly difficult to stay current. To address
this need, this survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the
literature and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the development
of GANs, VAEs, and DMs, including their many variants and combined approaches.
We highlight key innovations that have improved the quality, diversity, and
controllability of generated outputs, reflecting the expanding potential of
generative artificial intelligence. In addition to summarizing technical
progress, we examine rising ethical concerns, including the risks of misuse and
the broader societal impact of synthetic media. Finally, we outline persistent

TL;DR: SPRINT是一种高效的扩散变换器训练方法，通过稀疏-稠密残差融合实现高达75%的token丢弃，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)虽然提供最先进的生成性能，但其二次训练成本使得大规模预训练极其昂贵。现有的token丢弃方法要么参数繁重，要么在高丢弃率下表现不佳。

Method: 利用浅层和深层网络的互补作用：浅层处理所有token捕获局部细节，深层在稀疏子集上操作以减少计算，通过残差连接融合输出。采用两阶段训练：长掩码预训练和短全token微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，SPRINT实现9.8倍训练节省，FID/FDD性能相当。推理时，其路径丢弃引导(PDG)几乎将FLOPs减半同时提升质量。

Conclusion: SPRINT为高效DiT训练提供了一个简单、有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

TL;DR: Lite-Diff是一种轻量级扩散模型微调方法，通过冻结基础模型权重并优化小型残差适配器模块，显著降低计算开销并防止过拟合，特别适用于医学影像等数据稀缺领域。


<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但在医学影像等专业领域的微调面临数据稀缺和计算成本高的挑战，需要开发高效的迁移学习方法。

Method: 在冻结的扩散U-Net中集成轻量级适配层，结合潜在形态自编码器（用于领域特定潜在一致性）和像素级判别器（用于对抗对齐），仅优化小型残差适配器模块。

Result: 在三个胸部X光数据集上的实验表明，Lite-Diff相比完全微调实现了更优的适应效率，在最小数据设置下仍能有效工作。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型中的迁移学习提供了有前景的方向，促进了其在各种低数据领域的部署。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

Motivation: 由于扩散和流匹配模型的迭代采样过程计算成本高，现有方法难以直接控制最终生成的图像，需要一种更高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用零阶（无梯度）优化，将整个流过程作为黑盒处理，通过估计步长上界来保证收敛到全局最优解。

Result: 在图像编辑任务中，FlowOpt实现了最先进的结果，同时使用的神经网络函数评估次数与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: FlowOpt提供了一种高效、可监控的优化框架，能够在不增加计算成本的情况下实现高质量的图像控制生成。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型越来越多地用于评估多模态内容（包括演示幻灯片），但其在幻灯片特定理解方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 开发VLM-SlideEval评估框架，从三个维度测试VLMs：元素级提取、对几何/样式/文本扰动的鲁棒性、以及高级理解能力（如从乱序幻灯片恢复叙事顺序）。使用Zenodo公开数据集，从PowerPoint XML和实时渲染中标准化元素元数据。

Result: VLMs在像素级精确提取方面表现不佳，在受控扰动下显示出非平凡的协议度、保真度和一致性，在单幻灯片内容理解方面表现较好，但不能可靠地捕捉跨幻灯片的叙事结构。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在幻灯片评估方面存在局限性，需要开发校准的、批评者在循环中的评估器，以驱动智能管道中的迭代改进和选择。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合人体检测跟踪和时空建模的监控视频异常检测框架，在UCF-Crime数据集五类异常上达到92.41%的平均准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监控视频异常检测面临的异常事件多样性、类别不平衡和场景相关视觉干扰等挑战

Method: 使用YOLO-World检测人体实例，ByteTrack进行跟踪，高斯模糊抑制背景，InceptionV3提取空间特征，BiLSTM建模时序动态

Result: 在UCF-Crime五类子集上平均测试准确率92.41%，各类F1分数均超过0.85，表现出良好的泛化能力和类别不平衡鲁棒性

Conclusion: 前景聚焦的预处理方法显著提升了真实监控场景中的异常识别能力

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

*Zheng Qi,Chao Shang,Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GIFT方法，通过跟踪视觉注意力变化生成显著性图，在解码时同时增强显著视觉信息和用户查询的注意力，有效减少VLMs的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要归因于VLMs过度依赖语言先验知识而非视觉输入，但忽视了视觉注意力下沉问题（注意力被错误分配到任务无关区域）和跨模态融合平衡问题。

Method: GIFT方法预计算整体视觉显著性图，通过跟踪用户查询理解过程中的视觉注意力正向变化（"注视转移"），利用该图在每一步解码时同时增强显著视觉信息和用户查询的注意力。

Result: 实验表明GIFT在生成和分类任务中有效减少VLMs的幻觉，相比贪婪解码提升达20.7%，同时保持通用视觉语言性能且计算开销低。

Conclusion: GIFT通过解决视觉注意力下沉和跨模态融合不平衡问题，能有效缓解VLMs的幻觉现象，且方法简单高效。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

*Luca Caldera,Lara Cavinato,Francesca Ieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像的3D T1加权脑MRI协调框架，通过解耦解剖内容和扫描仪/站点特异性变化来减少多中心研究中的变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描仪型号、采集协议和成像站点的差异导致多中心研究分析不一致和泛化性差，需要一种能够保持解剖保真度同时减少站点间变异性的协调方法。

Method: 使用基于结构相似性指数(SSIM)的可微损失函数来分离评估图像亮度、对比度和结构成分，通过多风格目标进行协调训练。

Result: 协调后结构SSIM达到0.97，亮度SSIM为0.98-0.99，Wasserstein距离显著降低。下游任务表现提升：脑年龄预测MAE从5.36年降至3.30年，阿尔茨海默病分类AUC从0.78升至0.85。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了跨站点图像一致性，保持了解剖保真度，并改善了下游模型性能，为大规模多中心神经影像研究提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态大语言模型在坐标预测中的位置编码问题，提出了一种无需训练的测试时方法VPSG来纠正位置偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但在精确坐标预测方面存在困难，特别是在高分辨率输入下位置编码效果减弱，导致坐标输出出现方向性偏差。

Method: 通过分析视觉位置编码被扰乱时的模型行为，提出VPSG方法：使用扰乱的位置编码进行辅助解码来隔离位置无关倾向，然后将其作为负证据指导数字预测，同时通过轻量级有限状态机保持坐标格式。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验表明，VPSG方法能够可靠地改善坐标预测性能，验证了位置编码鲁棒性对多模态大语言模型空间推理的重要性。

Conclusion: 位置编码失效是精确坐标预测的关键瓶颈，VPSG方法通过利用方向性偏差进行校正，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Rainbow是一个条件图像生成框架，通过将输入条件分解为不同的潜在表示来生成多样化的图像，解决了传统方法中随机种子修改难以产生有意义差异或提示多样性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统条件图像生成方法在条件包含不确定性时难以生成多样化的合理图像，要么通过修改随机种子产生难以区分的差异，要么通过多样化输入提示但多样性有限。

Method: Rainbow框架将输入条件分解为多样化的潜在表示，每个表示捕捉不确定性的一个方面。使用生成流网络参数化潜在图，并利用其高级图采样能力生成多样化的轨迹，从而产生多样化的条件表示和对应的输出图像。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像数据集上的评估表明，Rainbow在图像合成、图像生成和反事实生成任务中，在多样性和保真度方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: Rainbow是一个有效解决条件图像生成中不确定性问题的框架，能够生成多样化且高质量的图像，适用于任何预训练的条件生成模型。

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

TL;DR: GRAID是一个基于2D几何基元生成高质量空间推理VQA数据集的新框架，避免了3D重建错误和生成幻觉，在人类评估中达到91.16%的准确率，显著优于现有方法的57.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理任务上表现不佳，主要原因是现有数据集生成方法存在3D重建的级联建模误差和生成幻觉问题，导致数据集质量不高。

Method: GRAID仅使用标准物体检测器输出的2D边界框来确定定性空间关系，避免了3D重建误差和生成幻觉，能够生成高质量的空间推理VQA对。

Result: 在BDD100k、NuImages和Waymo数据集上生成了850万高质量VQA对，人类验证准确率达91.16%。模型在GRAID数据上训练后，在未见问题类型上获得47.5%和37.9%的准确率提升，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: GRAID通过2D几何基元方法有效解决了空间推理数据集的质量问题，显著提升了视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%
on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all

TL;DR: CogStereo是一个新颖的立体匹配框架，通过嵌入隐式空间认知到优化过程中，使用单目深度特征作为先验，解决了遮挡和弱纹理等挑战性区域的问题，实现了零样本泛化和跨域性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度立体匹配方法在基准数据集上表现良好，但缺乏像其他视觉任务中基础模型的零样本泛化能力。特别是在遮挡和弱纹理区域，仅依赖几何信息往往不足。

Method: CogStereo将单目深度特征作为先验嵌入优化过程，采用双条件优化机制，结合像素级不确定性和认知引导特征，对不匹配进行全局一致性校正。

Result: 在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury、ETH3D、EuRoc和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，CogStereo不仅达到了最先进的性能，而且在跨域泛化方面表现出色。

Conclusion: CogStereo将立体视觉推向认知驱动的方法，通过空间认知实现了结构一致的视差估计，即使在几何信息不足的区域也能保持良好性能。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现良好，但对输入损坏引起的分布偏移很脆弱。作者旨在理解损坏如何影响CLIP的图像嵌入。

Method: 提出Mint方法，一种简单的测试时适应方法，使用均值累加器和梯度累加器在运行时最大化基于伪标签的类间方差。

Result: Mint在小批量情况下有效工作，在多个损坏基准测试和CLIP架构中持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 嵌入方差崩溃与性能下降密切相关，最大化类间方差可以证明性地提升嵌入质量，Mint方法在提升CLIP对输入损坏的鲁棒性方面有效。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自我中心视觉基准主要忽略影响人类决策和行为的情绪状态，假设中性情感和统一人格，限制了视觉系统捕捉行为关键内在驱动因素的能力。

Method: 使用Meta的Project Aria眼镜记录，包括眼动追踪视频、头戴式光电容积描记、惯性运动数据和生理基线，参与者完成情绪诱发任务和自然活动，使用Circumplex模型、Mikels' Wheel和Big Five模型自我报告情感状态和人格。

Result: 经典学习方法作为真实世界情感预测的简单基线，在自我中心视觉系统捕获的信号上比处理生理信号产生更好的估计。

Conclusion: 该数据集将情绪和人格确立为自我中心感知的核心维度，为行为、意图和交互的情感驱动建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LOC框架有效提升了3D场景的开放集理解能力，为视觉语言模型在3D领域的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Motivation: 现有SFDA方法主要关注域偏移，但忽视了负迁移对模型性能提升的阻碍作用，需要同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 使用注意力机制捕获目标对象判别区域，通过空间和通道注意力实现跨层注意力残差融合和自蒸馏，对比全局-局部表示提升类别感知能力，采用动态质心评估策略生成可信质心和伪标签。

Conclusion: ARFNet框架有效缓解了SFDA中的负迁移和域偏移问题，通过注意力机制、对比学习和动态质心评估实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有NeRF模型主要依赖物体中心采样，难以在介质退化场景（如水下、雾霾、低光照）中保持等距和各向同性的度量感知。

Method: 提出反向分层上采样策略实现3D空间近均匀采样，建立统一的辐射传输模型将发射、吸收和散射统一到受Beer-Lambert衰减定律控制的粒子模型中。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法显著提高了重建保真度和物理合理性，并能估计介质属性如水深。

Conclusion: I2-NeRF通过统一的辐射传输建模和空间采样策略，有效提升了在复杂介质环境中的3D感知能力，为生成式AI的物理世界感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了HARMONY框架，通过联合利用VLMs的多模态融合信息和输出分布来评估生成响应的可靠性，在多个VQA基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VLMs在高风险应用中的部署，需要可靠机制评估其生成内容的可信度。现有不确定性估计方法要么依赖输出概率分布，要么利用隐藏表示，但都难以捕捉多模态复杂关系且易受语言先验影响。

Method: HARMONY框架同时利用模型激活中的融合多模态信息和VLM的输出分布来确定响应可靠性，将模型对视觉理解的内在信念与生成的标记概率结合使用。

Result: 在A-OKVQA、VizWiz和PathVQA三个开放VQA基准测试中，使用LLaVa-7b、LLaVA-13b和InstructBLIP三个VLMs，HARMONY始终与现有方法相当或更好，AUROC提升达4%，PRR提升达6%。

Conclusion: HARMONY通过联合利用模型内部信念和输出概率，在VLMs不确定性估计方面建立了新的最先进水平，证明了两种信号联合使用的有效性。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个简单的非参数生成模型，基于自然图像的三个原则，无需训练就能生成高质量图像样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图像生成模型在规模和逼真度上取得了显著进展，但其机制仍然不透明。本研究旨在剥离复杂的工程技巧，探索自然图像结构的最小理论。

Method: 基于自然图像的三个原则（空间非平稳性、低层规律性、高层语义），从局部上下文窗口定义每个像素的分布。模型采用非参数方法，无需训练。

Result: 在MNIST上生成高保真样本，在CIFAR-10上生成视觉上引人注目的图像。模型的白盒特性允许对泛化和多样性生成进行机制性理解。

Conclusion: 该模型揭示了"部分-整体泛化"的简单组合过程，为大型神经网络生成模型如何学习泛化提供了假设。

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和模型显著提高了建筑环境中轨迹预测的准确性，为开发避碰系统提供了有效解决方案，能够更好地应对动态和不可预测的建筑环境。

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GALA策略有效解决了多源主动域适应的关键挑战，通过全局聚类和局部选择的互补设计，显著提升了目标域性能，为实际应用提供了高效的标注获取方案

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Conclusion: UniPAN通过统一训练和测试分布，有效增强了模型的泛化能力，为实现"一次训练，永久部署"提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Conclusion: 通过解耦多样性和不确定性，该方法能够仅用极少量的标注像素实现高分割精度，为低预算语义分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DiffusionLane具有强大的泛化能力和有前景的检测性能，在多个基准测试中超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision

enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip

implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

TL;DR: 提出GSAlign网络解决空中-地面行人重识别任务，通过可学习薄板样条模块和动态对齐模块联合处理几何变形和语义不对齐问题，在CARGO数据集上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空中-地面行人重识别面临极端视角差异、遮挡和域差距等挑战，现有方法在处理严重姿态变化和空间不对齐方面存在局限。

Method: GSAlign包含两个关键组件：可学习薄板样条模块自适应扭曲行人特征以补偿几何变化，动态对齐模块估计可见性感知表示掩码以减轻遮挡影响。

Result: 在CARGO数据集四种匹配协议下，GSAlign相比之前最优方法在mAP和Rank-1准确率上分别提升18.8%和16.8%。

Conclusion: GSAlign通过联合处理几何和语义对齐，有效解决了空中-地面行人重识别中的视角差异和遮挡问题，显著提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role
in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we
introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset
containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our
dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering
and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies.
To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated
benchmark for Japanese cultural image classification, consisting of 374
classes. To assess the effectiveness of our dataset, we conduct experiments
using both WAON and the Japanese subset of ReLAION, one of the most widely used
vision-language datasets. We fine-tune SigLIP2, a strong multilingual model, on
both datasets. The results demonstrate that WAON enhances model performance on
WAON-Bench more efficiently than ReLAION and achieves higher accuracy across
all evaluated benchmarks. Furthermore, the model fine-tuned on WAON achieves

Motivation: 利用公开的大规模网络数据（如街景和卫星图像）进行城市社会经济感知对实现全球可持续发展目标至关重要。大视觉语言模型为此提供了新机会，但现有研究显示其在视觉数据的社会经济预测方面仍存在准确性和可解释性问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了结合强化学习和大视觉语言模型在可解释、通用城市社会经济感知方面的潜力。

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable
and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard通过比率归一化和梯度重加权解决GRPO强化学习中重要性比率分布偏移问题，防止隐式过度优化，提升扩散模型生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO框架中重要性比率分布存在系统性偏移（均值低于1且方差不一致），导致PPO裁剪机制失效，模型进入隐式过度优化阶段，虽然代理奖励增加但图像质量和文本对齐等关键指标急剧下降。

Method: 提出GRPO-Guard方法，包含比率归一化（恢复平衡且步长一致的重要性比率）和梯度重加权（均衡不同噪声条件下的策略梯度），形成受调控的裁剪机制。

Result: 在多种扩散骨干网络（SD3.5M、Flux.1-dev）和代理任务上的实验表明，GRPO-Guard显著减少过度优化，同时保持甚至提升生成质量。

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard通过简单的增强设计有效稳定GRPO优化过程，无需依赖繁重的KL正则化，解决了隐式过度优化问题。

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法主要关注通过数据增强产生的实例内部变化，但往往忽略了重要的实例间关系。

Method: 在预训练期间为教师和学生流构建KNN图，节点表示样本及其潜在表示，边编码实例间相似度。预训练后进行表示精炼，使用GNN在多跳邻居间传播信息以实现更广泛的上下文整合。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K数据集上分别实现了7.3%、3.2%和1.0%的准确率提升，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于图的机制在自监督表示学习中非常有效，能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的方法通常将fMRI活动映射到单个高层嵌入，并在整个生成过程中将其作为固定引导。这种方法会压缩分层神经信息，并且与图像重建的阶段需求不匹配。

Method: 提出MindHier框架，包含三个组件：分层fMRI编码器提取多级神经嵌入、层次到层次对齐方案强制与CLIP特征的逐层对应、尺度感知的从粗到细神经引导策略在匹配尺度上将嵌入注入自回归过程。

Result: 在NSD数据集上的广泛实验表明，MindHier实现了优于扩散基线的语义保真度，推理速度快4.67倍，并且产生更确定性的结果。

Conclusion: MindHier通过分层重建过程（先合成全局语义再细化局部细节）提供了一个高效且认知对齐的替代方案，类似于人类视觉感知过程。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately

rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

Conclusion: T2SMark通过创新的尾截断采样和两阶段框架，成功解决了噪声水印方法中鲁棒性与多样性的平衡问题，为扩散模型提供了有效的知识产权保护方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code
is available at

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

Method: 将图像描述建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出基于视觉引导并行扩展和轻量值网络的高效MCTS算法，并采用自适应早停机制。

Conclusion: TDSR框架通过分层规划方法有效解决了VLMs在图像描述中的根本挑战，在保持高质量规划的同时将昂贵的大模型调用频率降低了一个数量级。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

TL;DR: WAGIBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型在可穿戴辅助代理中推断用户目标能力的基准测试，包含29小时多模态数据和3,477条记录，人类准确率达93%，而最佳VLM仅为84%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴辅助代理中的目标推断问题，消除用户与代理交互所需的努力，通过多模态上下文观察推断用户目标。

Method: 收集了包含29小时多模态数据的新数据集，涵盖348名参与者的3,477条记录，包含视觉、音频、数字和纵向上下文观察，并评估了多个现代视觉语言模型家族。

Result: 人类表现优于模型表现（93% vs 84%），生成式基准显示更大模型表现更好，但仅55%的时间产生相关目标，模态消融表明模型能从相关模态中受益。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在目标推断任务上仍有很大改进空间，距离实际应用还有差距，但多模态信息对模型性能有积极影响。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电子断层扫描结合子体积平均是目前唯一能在分子分辨率下解析细胞内蛋白质结构的成像方式，但粒子挑选（定位和分类目标蛋白质）仍是主要瓶颈，依赖耗时的手动标注导致大量未标记断层图未被充分利用。

Method: 框架包含两个组件：(1) 受关键点检测启发的端到端热图监督检测模型；(2) 师生协同训练机制，在稀疏标签条件下增强性能。还引入了多视图伪标签和冷冻电子断层扫描特定的DropBlock增强策略。

Result: 在大规模CZII数据集上的广泛评估显示，该方法比监督基线F1分数提高了10%，证明了半监督学习在利用未标记冷冻电子断层扫描数据方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该半监督框架能有效利用未标记数据，显著提升冷冻电子断层扫描中蛋白质粒子检测的性能，为解决当前瓶颈提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Motivation: 当前2D和3D生成模型虽然取得进展，但从单张静态图像生成高质量4D动态内容仍面临挑战，传统方法在建模时间依赖性和准确捕捉动态几何变化方面存在局限，特别是考虑相机视角变化时。

Method: 提出DynaPose4D框架，集成4D高斯泼溅技术和类别无关姿态估计技术。使用3D高斯泼溅从单张图像构建3D模型，然后基于选定视图的一次性支持预测多视角姿态关键点，利用监督信号增强运动一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，DynaPose4D在动态运动生成中实现了出色的连贯性、一致性和流畅性。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅验证了DynaPose4D框架的有效性，还表明其在计算机视觉和动画制作领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要多个教师网络来实现多样性，计算成本高。本文旨在通过单个教师模型生成多样化视角，降低成本的同时提升蒸馏效果。

Method: 在单个教师模型上附加多个分支生成多视角，引入两种角度多样性损失：约束性角度间多样性损失和角度内多样性损失，确保视角既多样化又保持与原始输出的接近性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法超越了现有的知识增强方法，且能与其它知识蒸馏框架兼容，带来一致的泛化性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的角度多样性知识增强方法有效提升了知识蒸馏性能，具有计算效率高、兼容性好的优势。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

TL;DR: 提出了GateFuseNet，一种自适应3D多模态融合网络，通过门控融合模块整合QSM和T1w图像，用于帕金森病诊断，在准确率和AUC方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于幅度的MRI模态（如T1w）对帕金森病病理敏感性不足，而定量磁化率成像（QSM）能更好地量化深部灰质核团中的铁沉积，因此需要开发能有效整合这两种模态的诊断方法。

Method: 使用门控融合模块学习模态特定的注意力权重和通道级门控向量，进行选择性特征调制。这种分层门控机制增强ROI感知特征，同时抑制无关信号。

Result: 方法在三个现有最先进方法中表现最优，达到85.00%准确率和92.06% AUC。消融研究验证了ROI引导、多模态整合和融合定位的贡献。

Conclusion: GateFuseNet通过自适应多模态融合有效提升了帕金森病的MRI诊断性能，Grad-CAM可视化证实了模型对临床相关病理区域的关注。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在生成逼真和提示对齐的图像方面取得了显著进展，但在涉及细粒度属性或时间敏感事件时，常常产生与可验证知识相矛盾的输出。传统的检索增强方法由于依赖静态源和浅层证据整合，无法在准确和不断发展的知识基础上进行生成。

Method: ORIG框架迭代地从网络检索和过滤多模态证据，并逐步将精炼的知识整合到增强提示中，以指导图像生成。

Result: 实验表明，ORIG在事实一致性和整体图像质量方面显著优于强基线模型，突显了开放多模态检索在事实图像生成中的潜力。

Conclusion: ORIG通过开放多模态检索增强框架，有效解决了事实图像生成中的知识矛盾问题，为生成既视觉逼真又事实准确的图像提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

TL;DR: AesCrop是一个基于美学驱动的图像裁剪模型，通过整合VMamba图像编码器和Transformer解码器，结合新颖的Mamba Composition Attention Bias机制，实现端到端的基于排名的图像裁剪，生成多个裁剪结果及对应质量评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像裁剪方法在构图知识整合方面存在局限：评估方法缺乏全局性，回归方法缺乏多样性。现有混合方法未融入摄影构图指导这一关键美学属性。

Method: 提出AesCrop模型，包含VMamba图像编码器（增强MCAB机制）和Transformer解码器。MCAB通过将构图线索显式编码到注意力机制中，引导模型关注构图最显著区域。

Result: 大量实验表明，AesCrop在定量指标和定性视觉质量方面均优于当前最先进方法，生成更美观的裁剪结果。

Conclusion: AesCrop通过显式整合构图知识，成功解决了现有方法在全局性和多样性方面的局限，实现了更优的图像裁剪性能。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Method: 引入词组概念捕捉视觉词的空间共现和邻近性构建在线词典，结合概率转移模型将时间一致性直接融入相似度计算，并加入特征分布分析模块和专用后验证机制。

Result: 在公共数据集和自制受限管道数据集上的实验表明，BoWG在精度-召回率和计算效率方面均优于现有最先进方法，在Bicocca25b数据集上平均每张图像处理时间仅16毫秒。

Conclusion: BoWG方法在感知混叠环境中实现了优异的闭环检测性能，具有高精度、鲁棒性和计算效率，展现出良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the

TL;DR: 提出SRSR框架，通过空间重聚焦交叉注意力和空间定向无分类器引导机制，解决扩散超分辨率中的语义模糊和幻觉问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的超分辨率方法存在语义模糊问题，主要源于文本条件的不准确性和不完整性，以及交叉注意力容易分散到无关像素，导致语义错位和幻觉细节。

Method: 提出SRSR框架，包含两个核心组件：1）空间重聚焦交叉注意力(SRCA)，使用视觉基础分割掩码在推理时精炼文本条件；2）空间定向无分类器引导(STCFG)，选择性绕过对未接地像素的文本影响以防止幻觉。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，SRSR在所有数据集的标准保真度指标(PSNR和SSIM)上始终优于七个最先进的基线方法，并在两个真实世界基准测试的感知质量指标(LPIPS和DISTS)上表现更好。

Conclusion: SRSR框架在超分辨率任务中有效实现了高语义保真度和感知质量，解决了现有方法的语义模糊和幻觉问题。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

TL;DR: STATUS Bench是首个用于严格评估视觉语言模型理解物体状态细微变化能力的基准，包含三个同步任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。实验表明当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代视觉语言模型能够执行多种多模态任务，但它们识别物体状态的精确度仍不明确。为解决这一问题，需要建立一个严谨的评估基准来测试VLMs理解物体状态细微变化的能力。

Method: 提出了STATUS Bench基准，包含三个同步任务：物体状态识别(OSI)、图像检索(IR)和状态变化识别(SCI)。使用手工制作的数据集，包含图像对、物体状态描述和状态变化描述。同时创建了包含1300万半自动生成描述的STATUS Train训练数据集。

Result: 实验显示，在提出的严格评估方案下，大多数开源VLMs表现出接近随机水平的零样本性能。在STATUS Train上微调后，Qwen2.5-VL达到了与Gemini 2.0 Flash相当的性能。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍有显著困难，STATUS Bench和STATUS Train对于推进VLM研究中物体状态识别的发展是必要的。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild

three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on

framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments

Result: 在XLFM-Zebrafish基准上PSNR提升了7.7%

Conclusion: 该方法通过标准化数据集、自监督学习和物理约束，有效提升了XLFM的3D重建质量

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art

*Boyi Zheng,Yalin Zheng,Hrvoje Bogunović,Qing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSScreen V2是一个部分监督的自训练框架，用于多种视网膜疾病筛查。它通过三分支架构（一个教师网络和两个学生网络）处理多源部分标注数据，解决标签缺失和域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖完全标注或单域数据集，无法有效处理多个部分标注且分布不同的数据集中的标签缺失和域偏移挑战。

Method: 采用三分支架构：教师分支从弱增强图像生成伪标签解决标签缺失；两个学生分支分别使用低频丢弃（LF-Dropout）增强域鲁棒性，以及低频不确定性（LF-Uncert）通过对抗学习的高斯扰动估计不确定域变异性。

Result: 在多个域内和域外眼底数据集上的实验表明，PSScreen V2实现了最先进的性能和优异的域泛化能力。与多种骨干网络（包括视觉基础模型DINOv2）的兼容性测试以及在胸部X光数据集上的评估证明了该框架的通用性和适应性。

Conclusion: PSScreen V2是一个有效的部分监督自训练框架，能够处理多源部分标注数据中的标签缺失和域偏移问题，具有良好的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The
codes are available at https://github.com/boyiZheng99/PSScreen_V2.

TL;DR: 提出了一种投影嵌入扩散桥模型，通过引入新的反向随机微分方程，在采样过程中同时考虑FBP重建和投影数据，从而自然地实现数据一致性，在三种不完整CT数据重建任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从不完整投影数据重建CT图像的病态问题，现有扩散桥模型缺乏对数据一致性的有效整合，而数据一致性可以提升重建保真度和细节恢复能力。

Method: 提出投影嵌入扩散桥模型，设计新的反向SDE来从干净图像分布中采样，条件包括FBP重建和投影数据；将投影数据嵌入到反向SDE的得分函数中，并引入参数控制随机性水平，设计离散化方案减少误差。

Result: 在稀疏视图、有限角度和截断投影三种不完整数据类型的CT重建中，PEDB在标准、噪声和域迁移评估中均优于现有最先进的扩散桥模型。

Conclusion: PEDB通过将投影数据嵌入到扩散桥模型中，有效实现了数据一致性，在不完整CT数据重建任务中取得了卓越性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

*Yassh Ramchandani,Vijayashekhar S S,Jignesh S. Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWAN是一个三阶段自监督小波神经网络，用于从高光谱图像中联合估计端元和丰度，无需地面真值数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用小波基空间提供的稀疏、分布式和多尺度表示，通过自监督学习范式挖掘潜在的对称性特征，解决高光谱图像解混问题。

Method: 三阶段网络：SWANencoder将输入小波系数映射到低维潜在空间，SWANdecoder重建输入小波系数，SWANforward学习高光谱图像的物理特性。使用三阶段组合损失函数和Adam优化器。

Result: 在合成和真实基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中优于现有最先进的神经网络解混方法。

Conclusion: SWAN通过学习弹性解混函数、促进自监督和紧凑网络参数，实现了性能提升，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估ZebraPose模型从斑马到奶牛的跨物种姿态估计迁移学习效果，发现虽然形态相似性有助于模型适应，但合成数据到真实环境的领域差距限制了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业应用中缺乏大规模标注的牲畜姿态数据集，特别是奶牛。研究探索利用在合成斑马数据上训练的模型进行跨物种迁移学习的可行性。

Method: 使用ZebraPose（基于视觉transformer的模型）进行27个关键点检测，在三个数据集配置上评估：自定义农场数据集、APT-36K子集及其组合。

Result: 组合模型在分布内数据上表现良好（AP=0.86, AR=0.87, PCK 0.5=0.869），但在未见过的牛舍和牛群上泛化失败严重。

Conclusion: 合成到真实的领域差距是农业AI部署的主要障碍，物种间形态相似性不足以支持跨领域迁移。需要农业优先的AI设计，强调农场级真实性和跨环境鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

class imbalance and variability across imaging domains. We present a
DenseNet-121-based framework tailored for atypical mitosis classification in
the MIDOG 2025 (Track 2) setting. Our method integrates stain-aware

model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive
objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis
classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现优异，但对其输出进行精确控制和目标编辑仍具挑战性。现有方法通常依赖大量图像采样或训练辅助网络，效率受限。

Method: 分析自注意力权重矩阵中编码的数据分布结构信息，计算这些权重矩阵的特征向量来获得稳健且可解释的编辑方向，无需额外数据或微调。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个数据集上产生高质量编辑效果，同时将编辑时间显著减少60%超过当前基准。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的方式来识别扩散模型中的语义编辑方向，为精确控制模型输出提供了新途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

Result: 在图像-文本检索和零样本分类任务上表现优异，显著优于现有最先进的基础模型。

Conclusion: SARCLIP模型有效提升了SAR图像的特征提取和语义理解能力，推动了SAR领域多模态学习的发展。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Conclusion: LVD-GS系统通过分层协作表示和动态建模，有效解决了大规模动态户外场景中的尺度漂移和动态物体影响问题，实现了鲁棒的3D重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

Motivation: Vision Transformers缺乏卷积网络的架构归纳偏置，特别是缺乏平移不变性，对微小图像平移比标准卷积网络更敏感。虽然卷积网络由于下采样和非线性层中的混叠问题也不是完美的平移不变，但已有抗混叠方法可以保证卷积网络的平移鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了Alias-Free ViT，包含两个主要组件：1）使用无混叠下采样和非线性操作；2）使用线性互协方差注意力机制，该机制对整数和分数平移都具有平移等变性，从而实现平移不变的全局表示。

Result: 该模型在图像分类任务中保持了有竞争力的性能，并且在对抗平移鲁棒性方面优于相似规模的其他模型。

Conclusion: 通过结合无混叠操作和线性互协方差注意力，成功构建了具有平移不变性的Vision Transformer，在保持性能的同时显著提高了对图像平移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

Conclusion: DAMap通过解决任务不对齐问题，显著提高了高精地图元素预测的质量，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

TL;DR: RoboSVG是一个统一的多模态框架，用于生成由文本、视觉和数值信号引导的交互式SVG图形。该框架包含多模态引导生成、候选SVG合成和数值引导优化三个步骤，并在大规模RoboDraw数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVG图形在数字设计和机器人控制中具有重要作用，但现有方法在生成交互式SVG方面存在局限性。本文旨在开发一个能够处理多种输入信号并生成高质量SVG的统一框架。

Method: 提出RoboSVG框架：1）基于输入查询生成多模态引导；2）通过专用生成模块合成候选SVG；3）在数值引导下优化SVG质量。构建了包含100万个样本的RoboDraw数据集支持该框架。

Result: 实验表明RoboSVG在文本到SVG、图像到SVG、部分SVG到SVG和部分图像到SVG等四个任务中，均实现了优异的查询符合度和视觉保真度，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: RoboSVG建立了一个多功能SVG生成的新标准，其数据集和源代码将公开发布，为数字设计和机器人控制领域的SVG生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.
The dataset and source code of this project will be publicly available soon.

*Wenlong Li,Yifei Xu,Yuan Rao,Zhenhua Wang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADTree是一种无需训练的异常检测方法，通过分层粒度感知树结构实现灵活采样，利用预训练模型知识检测视频异常，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个问题：监督方法需要大量训练数据且无法解释异常；无训练方法使用固定长度时间窗口采样，难以准确捕捉不同时间跨度的异常。

Method: 使用分层粒度感知树结构进行灵活采样，基于预训练通用事件边界检测模型识别潜在异常边界，通过自适应粗细分层结构和冗余去除构建树结构，结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型进行异常感知和推理。

Result: 在三个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，VADTree在无需训练设置下达到最先进性能，同时大幅减少采样的视频片段数量。

Conclusion: VADTree通过分层树结构和多模态模型集成，有效解决了视频异常检测中时间跨度变化的问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Windsock和DANCE方法解决MRAG中的检索时机、模态选择和噪声抵抗问题，显著提升生成质量并减少检索次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRAG方法存在静态检索策略、模态选择不灵活和检索信息利用不足的问题，需要解决何时检索、选择什么模态以及如何有效利用检索信息三大挑战

Method: 引入Windsock模块进行检索决策和模态选择，提出DANCE指令调优增强检索信息利用能力，采用自评估方法转换数据集

Result: 实验表明该方法将生成质量提升17.07%，同时减少8.95%的检索次数

Conclusion: Windsock和DANCE方法有效解决了MRAG的关键挑战，在提升响应质量的同时降低了计算开销

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveMAE是一个专为多光谱卫星图像设计的掩码自编码框架，通过离散小波变换分离频率分量，结合地理条件位置编码，在遥感下游任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感领域标注数据稀缺限制了全监督方法的适用性，需要开发自监督学习方法来构建基础模型。

Method: 使用多级离散小波变换分离频率分量，引导编码器学习尺度感知的高频表示；提出地理条件位置编码，通过球谐函数整合地理先验知识。

Result: 在PANGAEA基准测试的多个下游任务中，WaveMAE相比之前的最先进方法实现了持续改进，在分割和回归基准上取得了显著增益；轻量级变体仅使用26.4%参数也能达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: WaveMAE被确立为一个强大且具有地理信息感知的多光谱遥感图像基础模型。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT)，一个端到端的大型统一transformer，用于统一空间重建和实例级上下文理解的知识，通过3D一致性对比学习策略从2D视觉输入中学习几何结构和实例聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D重建和空间理解分开处理，忽视了它们之间的关键相互作用，限制了泛化能力和下游3D理解任务的性能。现有对齐方法受限于特定语言模型的能力。

Method: 设计3D一致性对比学习策略，指导IGGT从仅2D视觉输入中编码具有几何结构和实例聚类的统一表示。构建InsScene-15K大规模数据集，包含高质量RGB图像、位姿、深度图和3D一致性实例级掩码标注。

Result: 该表示支持将2D视觉输入一致地提升为具有明确不同对象实例的连贯3D场景。

Conclusion: IGGT通过统一几何和语义理解，解决了现有方法在3D场景分析中的局限性，提升了泛化能力和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Abstract: Lipreading has emerged as an increasingly important research area for
developing robust speech recognition systems and assistive technologies for the
hearing-impaired. However, non-English resources for visual speech recognition
remain limited. We introduce LRW-Persian, the largest in-the-wild Persian
word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional
and dialectal coverage, and rich per-clip metadata including head pose, age,
and gender. To ensure large-scale data quality, we establish a fully automated
end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic
Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a
critical gap in low-resource languages, LRW-Persian enables rigorous
benchmarking, supports cross-lingual transfer, and provides a foundation for
advancing multimodal speech research in underrepresented linguistic contexts.

Conclusion: 该综述为跨视角定位和合成领域提供了全面的技术概览，包括比较分析和未来研究方向展望。

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决糖尿病足溃疡检测中公开数据集稀缺和变异性的挑战，以及类别不平衡问题。

Method: 使用ConvNeXt块提取局部特征，结合CBAM和DANet注意力机制，添加Transformer模块增强长距离依赖，并采用数据增强解决类别不平衡。

Result: 在DFUC2021和DFU数据集上，单次实验准确率达0.8961，精度0.9160；4折交叉验证准确率达0.9755，标准差仅0.0031，优于现有CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: ConMatFormer为糖尿病足溃疡分类设立了新基准，提供了用于医学图像分析的混合注意力Transformer框架，并通过可解释AI方法确保决策过程的透明性和可信度。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC)防御方法，通过语义一致性和空间一致性模块增强CLIP在零样本设置下的对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在零样本设置下对对抗攻击高度脆弱，而现有防御方法依赖带标签数据的对抗微调，限制了在零样本场景中的应用。

Method: SCC包含两个模块：语义一致性利用反攻击预热生成的软伪标签和多视图预测来正则化跨模态对齐；空间一致性通过增强视图对齐扰动视觉预测以稳定推理。

Result: 在22个基准测试和多种攻击设置下的广泛实验表明，SCC能持续提升CLIP的零样本鲁棒性，同时保持准确性，并可与其他VLM无缝集成。

Conclusion: SCC展示了从CLIP建立对抗鲁棒范式的巨大潜力，其影响可扩展到更广泛的视觉语言领域如BioMedCLIP。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Result: 在500个PathVQA样本上，综合得分从基准方法的0.378提升到0.683，保持高推理置信度(0.890)，每个样本识别3-5个诊断相关区域，生成平均57个词的结构化解释。

Conclusion: MedXplain-VQA展示了作为稳健可解释医学VQA系统的潜力，查询重构提供最大初始改进，链式思维推理实现系统化诊断过程。

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频驱动说话人脸生成方法虽然改进了音频-嘴唇同步，但在时间一致性、身份保持和定制化方面存在困难，特别是在生成长视频时。

Method: MAGIC-Talk包含ReferenceNet（保持身份并通过文本提示实现细粒度面部编辑）和AnimateNet（使用结构化运动先验增强运动连贯性），采用渐进潜在融合策略改善长视频质量。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIC-Talk在视觉质量、身份保持和同步准确性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了一个强大的解决方案，能够从单张图像保持身份，同时确保帧间平滑过渡。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge是一个轻量级评估协议，使用指令跟随的多模态LLM作为公平评判者来评估文本到图像系统的公平性，解决了现有方法在评估图像与提示匹配度和社会属性处理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像系统缺乏简单、可复现的方法来评估图像与提示的匹配度以及模型对社会属性的处理。常用代理方法（如人脸分类器和对比相似度）存在奖励表面线索、缺乏校准弃权、以及忽略弱可见属性（如宗教、文化、残疾）等问题。

Method: FairJudge协议将指令跟随的多模态LLM作为公平评判者，使用解释导向的评分标准（映射到[-1, 1]），将判断约束在封闭标签集内，要求基于可见内容的证据，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: 在FairFace、PaTA、FairCoT等数据集上评估性别、种族和年龄，并扩展到宗教、文化和残疾属性。在IdenProf、FairCoT-Professions和新发布的DIVERSIFY-Professions上评估职业正确性和对齐度。评判模型在人口统计预测上优于对比和人脸中心基线，提高了平均对齐度，同时保持高职业准确性。

Conclusion: FairJudge协议能够实现更可靠、可复现的公平性审计，为文本到图像系统提供了更有效的公平性评估方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SP-CSVR框架解决LVLMs的"风格陷阱"问题，通过风格-内容解耦实现跨风格语义理解的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在多样视觉风格下语义理解不稳定的问题，特别是在上下文学习中存在的风格陷阱挑战

Method: 集成跨风格特征编码器(CSFE)进行风格-内容解耦，语义对齐上下文解码器(SAICD)进行少样本风格适应，自适应语义一致性模块(ASCM)使用多任务对比学习确保跨风格语义不变性

Result: 在具有挑战性的多风格数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在视觉描述、视觉问答和上下文风格适应任务中表现优异

Conclusion: SP-CSVR通过有效的风格-内容解耦和语义一致性机制，显著提升了跨视觉风格的鲁棒性、泛化能力和效率

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastJAM是一种基于图的快速联合对齐方法，通过现成的图像匹配器和非参数聚类构建图结构，使用图神经网络传播对应关系，无需正则化项即可高效预测单应性参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合对齐方法通常需要长时间训练、大容量模型和大量超参数调优，计算复杂度高。

Method: 利用现成图像匹配器的成对匹配和快速非参数聚类构建关键点关系图，通过图神经网络传播和聚合对应关系，使用图像级池化预测单应性参数，采用逆组合损失消除正则化需求。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FastJAM在配准质量上优于现有现代JA方法，同时将计算时间从数小时或数分钟减少到仅需数秒。

Conclusion: FastJAM提供了一种快速有效的联合对齐解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度，无需正则化项和相关的超参数调优。

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Surgery框架，一种无需训练、零样本的概念擦除方法，直接在文本嵌入层操作，通过动态估计目标概念并执行校准向量减法来消除其影响，在保持图像质量的同时实现更完整和局部化的概念擦除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的概念擦除方法往往损害生成质量，需要一种既能有效擦除有害内容又能保持图像质量的新方法。

Method: 在扩散过程前直接操作文本嵌入，动态估计提示中的目标概念，执行校准向量减法来中和其影响，包含共现编码模块处理多概念擦除和视觉反馈循环解决潜在概念持续性问题。

Result: 在物体、显式内容、艺术风格和多名人擦除任务中显著优于现有方法，达到93.58 H-score的物体擦除效果，显式内容减少到仅1个实例，风格擦除H_a为8.09且无质量下降。

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery提供了一种无需训练的动态概念擦除解决方案，既能作为内置威胁检测系统，也为更安全的文本到图像生成提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强生成(RAG)和视觉语言模型(VLM)的零样本风力涡轮机叶片损伤检测框架，无需特定任务训练即可检测罕见或新型损伤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机叶片在恶劣环境中运行，需要及时检测损伤以防止故障。传统基于无人机和深度学习的方法依赖大量标注数据，难以检测罕见或演变的损伤类型。

Method: 构建包含技术文档、参考图像和领域指南的多模态知识库，使用混合文本-图像检索器结合关键词感知重排序，为VLM提供相关上下文，无需任务特定训练即可注入领域知识。

Result: 在30张标记叶片图像上的测试显示，RAG增强的VLM正确分类了所有样本，而相同VLM无检索时准确率和精度均较差。框架在可解释性和泛化性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 该研究为工业检测提供了一种数据高效的解决方案，减少了对大量标注数据的依赖，能够通过领域知识检测未见过的缺陷。

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估算牧场生物量对于畜牧生产系统的决策至关重要，可以优化放牧率，最大化牧场利用率，同时减少过度放牧风险。

Method: 收集了19个澳大利亚地点的牧场图像，涵盖多个季节和温带牧场物种。每个图像对应70cm×30cm样方，并配有地面测量数据，包括按组分分类的生物量、植被高度和NDVI值。

Conclusion: 该数据集已发布在Kaggle竞赛平台上，挑战国际机器学习社区解决牧场生物量估算问题。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-LangSplat通过使用预训练的通用自编码器替代场景特定自编码器，解决了LangSplat在3D开放词汇语言场建模中的可扩展性问题，实现了高效且性能相当的3D场景查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangSplat需要为每个场景训练专门的语言自编码器进行特征压缩，这带来了昂贵的逐场景优化瓶颈，限制了部署的可扩展性。

Method: 使用在ScanNet数据集上预训练的通用自编码器替代场景特定自编码器，采用固定的紧凑潜在空间来处理任何新场景的语言特征，无需场景特定训练。

Result: 整个语言场构建过程效率显著提升，同时查询性能与原LangSplat方法相当或更优，通过MSE和余弦相似度验证了表示保真度。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入能够高效准确地支持新颖3D场景中的开放词汇查询，为可扩展的实时交互3D AI应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PPE的位置保持嵌入方法，通过解耦编码3D位置信息来保持视觉token压缩时的时空结构，提升多模态大语言模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的token合并方法虽然减少了序列长度，但经常破坏空间布局和时间连续性，因为它们忽视了位置关系。

Method: PPE在token维度上显式引入解耦的3D位置编码，使每个压缩token能够封装来自多个原始token的不同位置。支持级联聚类策略进行渐进式token压缩。

Result: 在现有token合并框架中应用PPE，在多个视觉语言基准测试上实现了2%~5%的持续改进，包括MMBench、TextVQA和VideoMME。

Conclusion: 保持位置线索对于高效有效的MLLM推理至关重要，PPE是一种参数无关的通用操作符，可无缝集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究通过训练Bi-Encoder网络测试生物特征统计无关的假设，发现左右虹膜存在相关性，指纹模型重现了先前研究的正相关结果，但跨模态匹配效果仅略高于随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试生物特征统计无关的历史假设，探索个体不同生物特征之间的相关性。

Method: 使用ResNet-50和Vision Transformer骨干网络构建Bi-Encoder架构，在274名受试者的约10万张指纹和7千张虹膜图像上训练，通过对比损失最小化同一受试者图像间的差异。

Result: 虹膜ResNet架构在虹膜-虹膜匹配中达到91% ROC AUC，证明左右虹膜相关；指纹模型重现了正相关结果；跨模态匹配仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了生物特征独立性的假设，未来计划扩展到其他生物特征，需要更多数据和更复杂的流程来获得更好的跨模态匹配结果。

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

Motivation: 现有基于码本的解决方案使用全局共享码本，但忽略了人脸图像中类别特定的相关性和令牌间的语义差异，导致在低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 学习不同图像类别的码本组，为每个令牌分配独立码本，通过少量比特记录每个令牌所属的码本组，在降低每个码本组大小的同时保持表达能力。

Result: 在0.05 bpp下，重建图像在人脸识别数据集上达到93.51%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到任何现有的基于码本的表征学习方法中，有效提升了人脸图像压缩的重建性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型虽然能力强大但需要从头训练且计算资源消耗大，作者希望找到更高效的方法来获得竞争性性能。

Method: 采用双重融合机制：保留原始模型块的同时在网络中插入多模态自注意力块，实现理解编码器的高级语义表示与生成编码器的低级空间信号的协同融合。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：GenEval组合文本到图像生成0.91，DPG-Bench复杂文本到图像生成82.16，GEditBench 6.06，ImgEdit-Bench图像编辑3.77。

Conclusion: 通过战略性地融合公开可用的专业模型，可以在少量训练数据下获得竞争性性能，为统一多模态建模的未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

Motivation: 现有的免训练视频编辑模型在处理职业相关提示时容易陷入性别刻板印象，需要一种能够在保持视频质量的同时减轻性别偏见的方法。

Method: 1) 从现有少数群体表示中推导公平嵌入，通过软注入去偏置标记到文本编码器；2) 在时间自注意力和提示到区域交叉注意力中集成公平调制；3) 使用区域约束注意力掩码和时间衰减权重增强区域内部一致性；4) 通过去偏置提示嵌入的公平敏感相似性掩码重新加权标记到区域匹配分数。

Conclusion: FAME通过公平感知的注意力调制机制，有效减轻了视频编辑中的职业性别偏见，同时保持了时间一致性和语义保真度。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式帧选择来保持DDIM反转的时间一致性，这会引入人为偏差并降低端到端推理的可扩展性。

Method: VALA采用变分框架和对比学习目标，将跨帧潜在表示压缩为保持内容和时间一致性的潜在锚点。

Conclusion: VALA能够自适应选择关键帧并压缩其潜在特征，为训练免费的视频编辑提供了一种有效且高效的时间一致性保持方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的驾驶场景生成框架，联合生成高质量语义占据、多视角视频和LiDAR点云，基于新构建的大规模Nuplan-Occ数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的占据中心方法依赖标注的占据数据，但这类数据仍然稀缺，限制了生成性能。

Method: 采用时空解耦架构支持4D动态占据的高保真空间扩展和时间预测；提出基于高斯溅射的稀疏点图渲染策略增强多视角视频生成；使用传感器感知嵌入策略显式建模LiDAR传感器特性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一框架实现了高质量的驾驶场景生成，解决了数据稀缺问题，并展示了在下游应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

TL;DR: VoMP是一种前馈方法，通过多视图特征聚合和几何变换器预测3D物体的体积材料属性（杨氏模量、泊松比、密度），无需手动制作材料属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理模拟需要空间变化的力学属性，传统方法需要费力手工制作，VoMP旨在自动预测这些属性。

Method: 使用多视图特征聚合和训练的几何变换器预测每个体素的材料潜在代码，这些代码位于物理合理材料流形上，通过真实世界数据集学习。

Result: VoMP在准确性和速度上都远超现有方法，能够准确估计体积材料属性。

Conclusion: VoMP提供了一种高效准确的方法来自动预测3D物体的材料属性，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

TL;DR: 本文提出SceneDecorator框架，解决文本到图像生成中的场景一致性挑战，通过VLM引导的场景规划和长期场景共享注意力机制，确保跨故事场景的一致性和叙事连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在保持概念一致性方面存在困难，特别是在场景层面。现有工作主要关注角色一致性，但忽略了场景在故事叙述中的关键作用，限制了实际应用中的创造力。

Method: 提出训练免费的SceneDecorator框架，包含：1）VLM引导的场景规划，以"全局到局部"方式确保不同场景间的叙事连贯性；2）长期场景共享注意力机制，维持跨多个故事的长期场景一致性和主题多样性。

Result: 大量实验证明SceneDecorator具有优越性能，在艺术、电影和游戏领域展现出释放创造力的潜力。

Conclusion: SceneDecorator通过解决场景规划和场景一致性两个关键挑战，为文本到图像生成提供了更强大的场景导向故事生成能力，有望推动相关领域的创意发展。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

### [149] [LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995)
*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix是一个可微分的即插即用模块，通过混合U形网络中多尺度解码器的logits，自动学习最优的尺度融合方式和损失权重，提升分割性能且无推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U形网络在多尺度输出时要么只监督最终输出，要么对所有尺度使用相同权重进行深度监督，忽略了不同尺度预测之间的互补性。

Method: 使用四种轻量级融合算子（加法、乘法、连接、注意力加权融合）混合多尺度解码器logits，生成丰富的合成突变图，并通过softplus损失权重与网络参数共同优化。

Result: 在Synapse 8-organ数据集上，相比单输出监督提升DICE 4.2%，相比深度监督提升2.2%，相比等权重加法融合提升1.5%，在数据稀缺时优势更明显（+9.23%）。

Conclusion: LoMix通过可学习的加权多尺度融合，在多种U形网络和基准测试中都能显著提升分割性能，同时保持数据效率、完全可解释性和零推理开销。

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SLDGroup/LoMix.

TL;DR: CoMo是一个用于文本到视频生成的组合运动定制框架，通过解耦运动与外观学习以及空间隔离策略，实现在单个视频中合成多个不同运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型在复杂多主体运动控制方面存在困难，特别是组合场景下存在运动-外观纠缠和多运动融合无效的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：单运动学习阶段使用静态-动态解耦调优范式分离运动与外观；多运动组合阶段使用即插即用的分治策略，在去噪过程中空间隔离不同运动的影响。

Result: CoMo在组合运动定制方面达到了最先进的性能，显著提升了可控视频生成的能力。

Conclusion: CoMo框架有效解决了多运动定制问题，为可控视频生成开辟了新方向，并提供了新的基准和评估指标。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了统一的几何和属性增强框架UGAE，通过后几何增强、前属性增强和后属性增强三个核心组件，显著提升了点云压缩的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云的有损压缩会不可避免地导致几何结构和属性信息的不可逆失真，需要解决这些失真问题以提高压缩质量。

Method: UGAE框架包含三个组件：PoGE使用基于Transformer的稀疏卷积U-Net重建几何结构；PAE采用增强几何引导的重新着色策略和DA-KNN方法；PoAE使用属性残差预测网络和W-MSE损失。

Result: 在8iVFB、Owlii和MVUB三个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。相比G-PCC测试模型，几何BD-PSNR提升9.98dB，比特率节省90.98%；属性Y分量BD-PSNR提升3.67dB，比特率节省56.88%。

Conclusion: UGAE框架有效提升了点云压缩的几何和属性质量，在多个指标上取得了显著改进，同时大幅改善了感知质量。

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

TL;DR: 提出了M³T2IBench基准和AlignScore评估指标，用于评估文本到图像模型在多类别、多实例、多关系场景下的图像-文本对齐能力，并提出了Revise-Then-Enforce方法来提升对齐效果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在生成与文本提示完美对齐的图像方面存在困难，且现有评估方法要么过于简单，要么与人类评估相关性差，特别是忽略了同一类别下多个不同实例的复杂提示场景。

Method: 构建了大规模多类别、多实例、多关系的M³T2IBench基准，设计了基于目标检测的AlignScore评估指标，并提出了无需训练的Revise-Then-Enforce后编辑方法来提升图像-文本对齐。

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在这个具有挑战性的基准上表现不佳，而提出的Revise-Then-Enforce方法在广泛的扩散模型中都能提升图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: M³T2IBench和AlignScore为评估复杂文本到图像生成提供了更好的基准和指标，Revise-Then-Enforce方法能有效提升图像-文本对齐性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the
relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide
a robust foundation for future research.

<details>

Motivation: 现有自回归模型在图像生成中计算密集且样本多样性有限，需要更高效的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用嵌套自回归架构，设计分层多尺度模块，每个大尺度模块基于前一个小尺度模块的输出，内部使用另一个自回归结构生成token块，并结合流匹配损失和连续token。

Result: NestAR在保持竞争力的图像生成性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 嵌套自回归架构是解决自回归模型计算密集和多样性有限问题的有效方法，能够在降低复杂度的同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时往往通过过度下采样或固定窗口来牺牲时间保真度，无法同时捕捉全局上下文和细粒度时间细节。

Method: 提出分层架构HieraMamba，使用Anchor-MambaPooling块通过选择性扫描生成多粒度锚点标记，并采用锚点条件和段池化对比损失来保持局部细节和全局区分性。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上达到新的最先进水平，能够在长未修剪视频中实现精确、时间忠实的时间定位。

Conclusion: HieraMamba通过分层设计和对比学习策略，有效解决了长视频时序定位中时间保真度和语义丰富性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

Conclusion: EndoWave通过引入几何约束和小波监督，有效解决了内窥镜3D重建中的动态视觉伪影问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal

Conclusion: RDBM通过残差调制实现自适应图像修复，在保持未退化区域完整的同时有效修复退化区域，为扩散桥模型提供了统一的理论框架。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关的多模态融合框架，用于时间序列和单时间戳图像的融合，支持跨模态生成和稳健的下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索时间序列和图像数据的多模态融合，实现跨模态生成并提升下游任务的性能。

Method: 采用确定性和学习策略进行时间序列量化，利用掩码相关性学习目标，在统一表示空间中对齐离散的图像和时间序列标记。

Result: 在地球观测领域的实验中，预训练模型能从卫星图像生成一致的全球温度剖面，并在下游任务中平均R²提高6%、RMSE降低2%，优于基线方法50%的R²和12%的RMSE。

Conclusion: 该任务无关的预训练方法在多模态融合中表现出色，通过梯度敏感性分析提供了模型稳健性的见解。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: DeepSalt是一个基于深度学习的谱转移框架，通过知识蒸馏和新型谱适应单元将实验室光谱的高分辨率信息转移到卫星高光谱传感中，实现无需大量地面采样的准确大尺度盐度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤盐碱化严重威胁生态系统和农业，传统实验室光谱测量精度高但难以扩展到大范围，而卫星高光谱影像覆盖广但分辨率有限，需要桥接这一差距。

Method: 提出DeepSalt框架，结合知识蒸馏策略和新型谱适应单元，将实验室高分辨率光谱知识转移到卫星高光谱数据中。

Result: DeepSalt在综合基准测试中显著优于无显式域适应的方法，证明了谱适应单元和知识蒸馏策略的有效性，模型还能有效泛化到未见过的地理区域。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种能够实现大尺度土壤盐度准确估计的方法，无需大量地面采样，为区域和全球尺度的盐碱化监测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过总最小二乘法(TLS)谱线拟合的统一视角，调和了Bigun和Granlund 1987与Granlund和Knutsson 1995提出的两种结构张量构建方法，证明它们本质相通，并带来额外优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨两种看似不同的结构张量构建方法之间的理论联系，通过统一视角揭示它们的内在一致性，并简化结构张量的构建和解释。

Method: 使用总最小二乘法(TLS)线拟合功率谱作为共同分析框架，重新解释两种结构张量构建方法，证明它们可以统一处理。

Result: 发现Granlund和Knutsson 1995方法中的修正项变得不必要，省略后能保证张量保持半正定性；允许使用非正交滤波器和其他滤波器类型；支持多方向拟合。

Conclusion: 通过TLS统一视角，两种结构张量方法可以调和，简化了构建过程，扩展了滤波器选择范围，并提供了更灵活的方向分析能力。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角图像3D目标检测方法依赖从3D参考点生成的对象查询，但许多参考点距离目标物体较远，容易导致误检。

Method: 提出深度引导查询生成器(DQ3D)，利用深度信息和2D检测确保参考点从物体表面或内部采样；引入混合注意力机制融合历史检测结果与深度引导查询形成混合查询。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，相比基线方法，mAP提升6.3%，NDS提升4.3%。

Conclusion: 深度引导的查询生成和混合注意力机制能有效提升3D目标检测性能，特别是在处理部分遮挡物体时表现优异。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可迁移性评估方法难以准确评估具有多样化架构、训练策略和任务对齐的新兴预训练模型，需要更通用高效的评估框架。

Method: ITM框架隐式建模每个模型的内在可迁移性，采用分治变分近似策略来高效近似嵌入空间的演化过程。

Result: 在涵盖广泛训练机制和模型类型的综合基准测试中，ITM在稳定性、有效性和效率方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITM能够泛化到更广泛的模型和下游任务，推进了预训练和微调范式的发展。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出自适应门控融合(AG-Fusion)方法，通过识别可靠模式来选择性整合跨模态知识，在复杂场景中实现鲁棒的3D目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态相机-LiDAR融合方法在传感器退化或环境干扰等挑战性场景中性能显著下降，需要提升在复杂条件下的检测鲁棒性。

Method: 首先将各模态特征投影到统一的BEV空间并使用基于窗口的注意力机制增强，然后设计基于跨模态注意力的自适应门控融合模块来整合特征，构建可靠的BEV表示。

Result: 在标准KITTI数据集上达到93.92%的准确率，在新建的挑战性E3D数据集上比基线方法提升24.88%，在复杂工业场景中对不可靠模态信息表现出优越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AG-Fusion方法能够有效处理传感器退化等挑战性场景，在复杂工业环境中实现鲁棒的3D目标检测，并通过新建E3D数据集为复杂条件下的性能评估提供了基准。

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

Motivation: 现有3D场景类比方法需要额外训练和固定对象词汇表，限制了其在开放环境中的适应性。本文旨在开发一种无需训练、支持开放词汇的3D场景类比方法。

Method: 使用混合神经表示：基于视觉语言模型特征的稀疏图和3D形状基础模型的特征场。采用粗到精的对应匹配策略，先对齐图结构，再用特征场细化对应关系。

Result: 该方法能够在复杂场景间建立准确的对应关系，成功应用于轨迹和路径点迁移任务。

Conclusion: 提出的零样本、开放词汇3D场景类比方法有效克服了现有方法的限制，为机器人适应和规划提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

TL;DR: 本文研究视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，将异常行为识别构建为零样本语言基础任务，评估小型预训练视觉-LLM作为空间基础异常检测器的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄像头产生的海量视频数据远超人工监控能力，需要自动检测异常或犯罪事件以保障公共安全。智能体识别意外事件的能力与其空间推理能力密切相关。

Method: 将视频转换为文本描述，通过文本蕴含对标签进行评分，评估四种开放模型在UCF-Crime和RWF-2000数据集上的表现，包括提示和隐私保护条件。

Result: 少量样本示例可提高某些模型的准确性，但可能增加误报；隐私过滤器（特别是全身GAN变换）会引入不一致性降低准确性。当前视觉-LLM在简单、空间显著事件上成功，但在噪声空间线索和身份混淆方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了无需任务特定训练即可增强空间基础的具体路径：结构感知提示、跨片段轻量级空间记忆、描述过程中的场景图或3D姿态先验，以及保留动作相关几何的隐私方法。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

TL;DR: DecoDINO是基于DECO框架的三分支网络，使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器，通过类平衡损失权重和补丁级交叉注意力改进局部推理，在DAMON基准测试中显著提升了顶点级接触预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DECO模型在野外环境中进行人体与物体接触预测时存在局限性，包括只能生成二元接触图、在软表面、遮挡、儿童和假阳性足部接触方面表现不佳。

Method: 采用三分支网络架构，使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器，应用类平衡损失权重减少偏差，引入补丁级交叉注意力改进局部推理，顶点特征通过轻量级MLP和softmax分配语义接触标签。

Result: 在DAMON基准测试中：二元接触F1分数提升7%，测地误差减半，增加了对象级语义标签预测。消融研究表明LoRA微调和双编码器是改进的关键因素。

Conclusion: DecoDINO在DAMON挑战赛的两个任务中都优于基线模型，显著提升了人体与物体接触预测的准确性和语义理解能力。

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

Result: VR-Drive有效减轻了合成引起的噪声，并在视角变化下改进了规划性能。

Conclusion: VR-Drive是端到端自动驾驶系统在现实世界部署中可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理学检索解决方案，能够有效支持临床诊断和研究工作流程。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测在真实场景中的挑战，特别是智能手机从数字屏幕拍摄时产生的莫尔伪影会扭曲检测结果，这一问题此前很少受到关注。

Method: 收集了12,832个视频组成的数据集，涵盖多个公开数据集，并在不同真实条件下拍摄；使用DeepMoiréFake数据集和两种合成莫尔生成技术进行额外实验；评估了15个顶级检测器的性能。

Result: 莫尔伪影使检测性能下降高达25.4%，合成莫尔模式导致准确率下降21.4%；令人惊讶的是，去莫尔方法反而使问题恶化，准确率下降高达17.2%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能够稳健处理莫尔失真以及其他真实世界挑战（如压缩、锐化和模糊）的检测模型；通过引入DMF数据集，推动未来研究缩小受控实验与实际深度伪造检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式增大补丁尺寸的自动课程学习方法，用于3D医学图像分割，能显著提升分割性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统固定补丁尺寸采样在3D医学图像分割中存在的类别不平衡问题，并加速训练收敛过程。

Method: 在模型训练过程中逐步增大补丁尺寸，设计了资源高效模式和性能模式两种设置。

Result: 资源高效模式在保持Dice分数性能的同时将训练时间减少到44%；性能模式相对固定补丁尺寸基线获得1.28%的相对平均性能提升，同时将训练时间减少到89%。

Conclusion: 这种简单而优雅的输入数据变换策略能显著提升Dice分数性能和训练运行时间，且适用于多种分割骨干网络。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

TL;DR: 提出基于Shapley值的特征归因和模态评分方法，分析6个不同上下文长度的VLM模型在4个VQA数据集上的表现，发现模型过度依赖文本且多选VQA任务退化为忽略干扰项的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对视觉语言模型的依赖增加，需要评估多模态模型的复杂性和方向正确性，关注文本主导问题和模态间交互研究不足的问题。

Method: 使用基于Shapley值的特征归因和模态评分方法，将视频帧和文本元素视为平等特征，将多选VQA任务视为视频、问题和答案三个模态的交互。

Result: 结果显示模型对文本的依赖性，多选VQA任务退化为模型忽略干扰项的能力。

Conclusion: 当前VLM模型在多模态任务中存在文本主导问题，多选VQA任务的设计需要重新考虑以避免退化为简单的干扰项识别任务。

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的对象通常具有自然的层次组织，这可以显著帮助分类任务。捕捉对象间的关系能够实现更好的上下文理解并控制错误的严重程度，而传统的平面分类算法往往忽略了这一点。

Method: 基于YOLO模型家族构建端到端分层模型，引入新颖的分层架构、改进的损失函数和专门为分层特性设计的性能指标。在相同数据集的两个不同层次分类上进行训练和评估。

Result: 结果表明，所提出的方法能够有效处理现实世界对象中固有的层次结构，这是传统平面分类算法经常忽略的。

Conclusion: 分层模型能够更好地捕捉现实世界对象的层次关系，提供更好的上下文理解和错误控制，优于传统的平面分类方法。

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

TL;DR: AdaSDE是一种新颖的单步SDE求解器，通过动态调节误差校正强度来统一ODE的效率和SDE的误差鲁棒性，在5步函数评估下实现了最先进的扩散采样性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于ODE和SDE的求解器各有弱点：ODE求解器沿确定性轨迹积累不可约梯度误差，而SDE方法在步数预算有限时遭受放大的离散化误差。

Method: 引入AdaSDE，一种单步SDE求解器，通过轻量级蒸馏估计每个步骤的可学习系数，动态调节误差校正强度来加速扩散采样。该框架可与现有求解器集成。

Result: 在5 NFE下，AdaSDE在CIFAR-10上达到4.18的FID分数，在FFHQ上达到8.05，在LSUN Bedroom上达到6.96，表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AdaSDE成功统一了ODE的效率和SDE的误差鲁棒性，为扩散采样提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有讽刺检测研究主要关注单图像场景，忽略了多图像之间的语义和情感关系，无法有效建模现实世界中由多图像线索触发的讽刺情况。

Method: 提出跨图像推理模型(CIRM)，进行针对性跨图像序列建模以捕捉潜在的图像间联系，并引入基于文本-图像对应关系的相关性引导细粒度跨模态融合机制。

Result: MMSD3.0被证明是有效可靠的基准，能更好反映现实条件；CIRM在MMSD、MMSD2.0和MMSD3.0三个数据集上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了多图像讽刺检测的研究空白，提出的CIRM模型在单图像和多图像场景中均表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDReID是一个灵活的任意模态到任意模态的图像级重识别框架，通过解耦模态共享特征和模态特定特征，在模态匹配和不匹配场景下都能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的重识别系统经常面临模态不一致问题（如RGB、NIR、TIR传感器），而现有方法大多假设模态匹配条件，限制了实际应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出MDReID框架，包含模态解耦学习（MDL）和模态感知度量学习（MML）。MDL显式分解模态特征为共享和特定表示，MML通过正交性和互补性增强跨模态判别能力。

Result: 在三个多模态重识别基准测试（RGBNT201、RGBNT100、MSVR310）上，MDReID在模态匹配场景下分别获得9.8%、3.0%、11.5%的mAP提升，在模态不匹配场景下平均提升3.4%、11.8%、10.9%。

Conclusion: MDReID通过有效解耦模态特征，在多种模态条件下都表现出优越性能，为解决现实世界中的模态不一致重识别问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有多视角3D重建方法严重依赖输入视图之间的充分重叠，实践中遮挡和稀疏覆盖常导致重建不完整。虽然基于扩散的3D生成技术可以通过学习生成先验来补全不可见部分，但其随机性限制了生成结果的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReconViaGen，创新性地将重建先验整合到生成框架中，设计了多种策略来解决两个关键问题：(a) 提取多视角图像特征时构建和利用跨视角连接的不足；(b) 局部细节生成时迭代去噪的差可控性导致与输入不一致的几何和纹理细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReconViaGen能够重建与输入视图在全局结构和局部细节上都一致的完整且准确的3D模型。

Conclusion: ReconViaGen通过将重建先验整合到生成框架中，有效解决了基于扩散的3D生成方法在多视角重建中的一致性问题，实现了高质量的重建结果。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep

  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative
neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain
adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image
datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic
input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and
integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex
3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing
the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through
rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,
demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features
applicable to various downstream tasks.
  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image
analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面跟踪在机器人和增强现实中具有重要作用，但由于缺乏大规模平台，其发展受到限制，特别是在深度学习时代。

Method: 构建了一个包含1000个短期和150个长期视频的大规模数据集，所有视频在无约束条件下录制，每个视频帧通过四角点手动标注并经过多轮精细检查和优化，每个序列只包含一个独特目标以增强目标多样性。

Result: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化且最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集，评估了10个代表性平面跟踪器，结果显示顶级跟踪器在挑战性场景下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 平面跟踪仍需更多努力来改进性能，PlanarTrack数据集和评估结果将为未来研究提供比较基准。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

Conclusion: LSSR框架展示了遥感超分辨率在精准农业中的巨大潜力，通过高效利用多模态信息实现了科学可靠的图像重建和下游任务性能提升。

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

Conclusion: VideoTG-R1通过反射边界标注和课程RL实现了数据高效训练，有效解决了视频时序定位中的样本质量和难度挑战。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决点云学习领域因缺乏大规模数据集而受限的问题，通过公式驱动的方法生成任意规模的数据集，确保精确标注的可用性。

Method: 利用对称性概念创建具有已知结构的形状，构建公式驱动的数据集，支持自监督预训练和下游任务微调。

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Motivation: AI基础模型正在通过从大规模无标签数据集中学习通用特征来改变医学影像领域。传统方法通常基于单切片分析，无法充分利用3D脑部解剖信息。

Method: 扩展DINO-v2视觉变换器，将顺序MRI切片中的体积信息整合到模型中，超越传统的单切片范式，支持单模态和多模态输入。

Result: BrainFound在标签稀缺和多对比度设置下持续优于现有的自监督预训练策略和监督基线，通过整合多种3D MRI模态信息提高了诊断准确性。

Conclusion: BrainFound为3D神经影像流程提供了一个可扩展且实用的解决方案，在临床部署和研究创新方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效准确的大规模移动激光扫描点云配准工作流，针对城市街道场景的复杂性，通过SSC预处理和PV-GICP精细配准方法，实现了亚厘米级精度和超过50%的计算时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市环境中点云配准面临的密度变化、噪声特性和遮挡场景等挑战，这些复杂性在繁华城市中心尤为常见。

Method: 1. SSC预处理技术：通过识别相互正交的平面表面来优化分割MLS轨迹数据，减少漂移影响；2. PV-GICP精细配准方法：在体素分区中选择性利用平面表面进行配准。

Result: 在慕尼黑内城真实数据集上的实验表明，平均配准精度达到亚0.01米，同时处理时间显著缩短，计算时间比传统点对面ICP方法减少50%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力推动自动化3D城市建模和更新，在城市规划、基础设施管理和动态城市监测中具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在CAD逆向工程中存在局限性：自下而上的几何驱动方法无法生成完全参数化输出，自上而下的策略忽略细粒度几何细节，且都忽略了草图级约束这一CAD建模的关键要素。

Method: 受人类设计师手动执行任务的启发，利用多平面截面提取2D模式，更有效地捕捉精细参数细节，支持草图约束的直接融入。

Result: 能够重建详细且可编辑的CAD模型，在性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了在CAD逆向工程中直接整合草图约束，为CAD模型重建提供了更完整和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中高质量标注样本获取困难，且类别分布不均衡会降低微调效果，需要一种能应对这些挑战的方法。

Method: CURVETE采用基于样本分解粒度的课程学习策略训练无标签通用样本，并在下游任务中结合类别分解方法处理不均衡分布。

Result: 在脑肿瘤、数字膝关节X光和Mini-DDSM数据集上，使用ResNet-50分别达到96.60%、75.60%和93.35%的准确率；使用DenseNet-121分别达到95.77%、80.36%和93.22%的准确率。

Conclusion: CURVETE模型能有效提升医学图像分类性能，特别是在样本有限和类别分布不均衡的情况下，优于其他训练策略。

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

TL;DR: 提出FRBNet，一种基于频域通道比的可学习滤波器模块，用于提取光照不变特征，提升低光条件下下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对低光条件建模不完整，性能仍有不足，需要重新审视低光图像形成机制。

Method: 扩展经典Lambertian模型，在频域分析并证明频域通道比可提取光照不变特征，设计可端到端训练的FRBNet模块。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优异，暗光目标检测提升2.2 mAP，夜间分割提升2.9 mIoU。

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块能有效提升低光视觉任务性能，无需修改损失函数。

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有的"Thinking with Images"方法在图像推理中表现出色，但尚未扩展到视频推理任务。视频推理需要处理时序信息，现有方法依赖外部工具，缺乏自主推理能力。

Method: 构建Video-Thinker-10K数据集，包含自主工具使用的思维链推理序列。采用监督微调学习推理格式，然后使用组相对策略优化强化推理能力。

Result: Video-Thinker-7B在Video-Holmes、CG-Bench-Reasoning和VRBench等基准测试中显著优于Video-R1等现有基线，在7B规模MLLM中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Video-Thinker成功将动态推理范式扩展到视频领域，使MLLM能够自主进行视频推理，无需构建和调用外部工具，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

TL;DR: UrbanIng-V2X是首个大规模多模态数据集，支持车辆和基础设施传感器在德国英戈尔施塔特三个城市交叉路口的协同感知，包含34个时间对齐和空间校准的传感器序列，提供丰富的多传感器数据和3D标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协同感知数据集通常局限于单个交叉口或单一车辆，缺乏多车辆和多基础设施传感器在多个交叉口的综合数据集，导致算法在多样化交通环境中评估受限，容易过拟合。

Method: 在德国英戈尔施塔特三个城市交叉路口部署传感器，收集34个20秒的传感器序列，包含2辆车和最多3个基础设施传感器杆的协调场景，提供车辆RGB相机、LiDAR和基础设施热成像相机、LiDAR等多模态数据。

Result: 数据集包含12个车辆RGB相机、2个车辆LiDAR、17个基础设施热成像相机和12个基础设施LiDAR的数据，以10Hz频率标注13个对象类的3D边界框，总计约712k标注实例。

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X填补了多车辆、多基础设施传感器在多个交叉口的协同感知数据集空白，提供了全面的评估基准，并公开了代码库、数据集、高清地图和数据收集环境的数字孪生。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

TL;DR: MergeMix是一种训练时增强范式，通过注意力感知的图像混合和偏好驱动训练，在监督微调和强化学习之间架起桥梁，提升多模态大语言模型的视觉-语言对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在权衡：监督微调需要大量人工标注且无法捕捉细微偏好，强化学习有奖励信号但存在开销和不稳定性问题。需要一种兼顾可扩展性、鲁棒性和对齐质量的方法。

Method: 1. 通过token合并实现注意力感知的图像混合，增强聚类表示和空间上下文；2. 构建混合图像与原始图像的偏好对；3. 使用SimPO损失进行优化。

Result: MergeMix在分类任务中超越了其他基于启发式的方法，实现了具有竞争力的准确率和改进的效率。

Conclusion: MergeMix为分类和多模态大语言模型中的偏好对齐提供了一种可扩展的方法，增强了注意力一致性和效率。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文发现大型视觉语言模型生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链(MCoT)存在忠实性问题，视觉信息往往不准确但答案正确。作者提出SCCM学习策略来改善视觉忠实性，无需额外标注即可提升推理可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs通过强化微调生成的MCoT中视觉信息不准确但答案正确，表明推理过程缺乏忠实性。这是由于RL奖励只鼓励视觉-文本交替格式，而不考虑视觉信息的正确性。

Method: 提出SCCM学习策略，鼓励MCoT生成足够但最少的视觉组件，这些组件能独立导向正确答案。该方法无需标注，可与各种RFT方法即插即用。

Result: 实验结果显示SCCM在一系列细粒度感知和推理基准上持续提升了视觉忠实性。

Conclusion: SCCM能有效解决MCoT中的视觉忠实性问题，提高推理过程的可靠性，且方法通用性强。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is
available at https://github.com/EugeneLiu01/Faithful_Thinking_with_Image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前体积视频重光照方法存在时间不稳定问题，扩散方法在单帧效果好但序列中会产生噪声，视频扩散模型受限于内存和规模

Method: 结合扩散先验与时域正则化，通过光流引导聚合多帧材质属性，使用高斯不透明度场提取网格代理进行物理渲染

Result: 在真实和合成数据上实验表明，相比纯扩散基线，该方法在序列重光照中显著更稳定，且能处理更长视频片段

Conclusion: 混合方法平衡学习先验与物理约束，是实现生产级体积视频重光照的实用步骤

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在复杂推理任务上面临高质量图像-文本推理数据稀缺的问题，而文本推理资源丰富且可扩展，但如何利用这些资源提升视觉语言模型推理能力仍是一个开放性问题。

Method: 结合基于组相对策略优化的强化学习和在线蒸馏，通过教师模型指导学生模型的推理轨迹，并强调冷启动对齐对于有效迁移的重要性。

Conclusion: VOLD框架成功实现了从文本教师模型到视觉语言学生模型的推理能力迁移，冷启动对齐对于在线蒸馏的有效性至关重要。

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络在图像分类中未能充分考虑视觉实体间的底层结构和关系，限制了其在医学图像分类中的性能表现。

Method: iPac整合了补丁分割、特征提取、聚类、图构建和图学习等多个阶段，通过捕捉相关特征并组织成簇来构建有意义的图表示，有效封装图像语义。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验评估显示，iPac相比基线方法平均准确率提升高达5%。

Conclusion: iPac通过利用图表示并考虑视觉实体间的固有结构和关系，为图像分类特别是医学图像分类提供了一个通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
among visual entities.

### [200] [FreeFuse: Multi-Subject LoRA Fusion via Auto Masking at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23515)
*Yaoli Liu,Yao-Xiang Ding,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeFuse提出了一种无需训练的多主体文本到图像生成方法，通过自动融合多个主体LoRA，利用交叉注意力层权重动态生成主体掩码，实现高质量的多主体生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么专注于预推断的LoRA权重合并，要么依赖分割模型和复杂技术来隔离LoRA输出，这些方法存在效率低、复杂度高的问题。

Method: 通过分析交叉注意力层权重自动生成上下文感知的动态主体掩码，在推断过程中直接将这些掩码应用于LoRA输出，无需额外训练或修改LoRA。

Result: 实验验证FreeFuse在多主体生成任务中，在生成质量和可用性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFuse展示了无需训练、无需修改LoRA、无需辅助模型的高效多主体生成能力，具有优越的实用性和效率。

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

*Wanmeng Li,Simone Mosco,Daniel Fusaro,Alberto Pretto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态伪标签过滤方案和先验引导数据增强管道，用于提升点云语义分割的无监督域自适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实LiDAR点云标注成本高昂，现有自训练方法未能有效利用未标记数据，依赖固定置信度阈值导致性能不佳。

Method: 动态伪标签过滤(DPLF)增强真实数据利用，先验引导数据增强管道(PG-DAP)缓解域偏移，数据混合一致性损失学习上下文无关表示。

Result: 在两个合成到真实点云语义分割任务上取得最优性能，消融研究验证了DPLF和PG-DAP模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升点云UDA语义分割性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

*Baoqi Pei,Yifei Huang,Jilan Xu,Yuping He,Guo Chen,Fei Wu,Yu Qiao,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoThinker是一个赋予多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)自我中心推理能力的新框架，通过时空思维链监督和两阶段学习课程，在多个自我中心基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs擅长可见事件推理但缺乏具身的第一人称理解能力，无法有效处理自我中心视频中不可观察的智能体意图和细粒度交互推理。

Method: 构建大规模EgoRe-5M数据集，包含1300万个多样化自我中心视频片段，带有详细思维链标注和密集手-物体定位；采用两阶段学习：先通过SFT注入推理技能，再通过RFT增强时空定位能力。

Result: EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中超越现有方法，在细粒度时空定位任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该框架成功赋予MLLMs强大的自我中心推理能力，解决了第一人称视频理解的核心挑战。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

*Hongkai Lin,Dingkang Liang,Mingyang Du,Xin Zhou,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MERGE是一个统一模型，能够在保持预训练文本到图像模型生成能力的同时，实现零样本深度估计，通过可插拔转换器和组重用机制实现两种模式的无缝切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式深度估计方法在训练时会导致预训练模型的图像生成能力严重退化，需要开发既能保持原有生成能力又能扩展深度估计功能的统一模型。

Method: 提出可插拔转换器框架，通过简单切换实现图像生成和深度估计模式转换；采用组重用机制提高额外可学习参数的利用率。

Result: MERGE在多个深度估计基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时完全保留了预训练模型的图像生成能力。

Conclusion: 预训练文本到图像模型不仅能用于图像生成，还能轻松扩展到深度估计任务，MERGE框架成功实现了这一目标。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The
code will be made available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/MERGE

*Junyoung Seo,Rodrigo Mira,Alexandros Haliassos,Stella Bounareli,Honglie Chen,Linh Tran,Seungryong Kim,Zoe Landgraf,Jie Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead Anchoring方法，利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性锚点，解决音频驱动人体动画中的身份漂移问题，无需额外生成关键帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动的人体动画模型在时间自回归生成过程中容易出现身份漂移，现有使用关键帧作为时间锚点的方法需要额外生成关键帧且限制自然运动动态。

Method: 使用未来时间步的关键帧作为前瞻锚点，模型在响应即时音频线索的同时持续追求这些未来锚点，实现自我关键帧化，参考图像直接作为前瞻目标。

Result: 在三个人体动画模型上应用该方法，实现了更优的唇部同步、身份保持和视觉质量，时间前瞻距离自然控制表达性与一致性的平衡。

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring方法通过未来时间步的关键帧锚点，有效解决了身份漂移问题，在不同架构上均表现出改进的时间调节能力。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FARMER是一个结合归一化流和自回归模型的生成框架，用于直接从原始像素进行可处理的似然估计和高质量图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续自回归模型在视觉像素数据上建模时面临的序列过长和高维空间问题，同时保持可扩展训练和精确似然估计。

Method: 使用可逆自回归流将图像转换为潜在序列，通过自监督维度减少方案划分潜在通道，并设计一步蒸馏和重采样分类器自由引导算法。

Result: 在像素级生成模型中取得竞争性性能，同时提供精确似然和可扩展训练。

Conclusion: FARMER成功统一了归一化流和自回归模型的优势，为像素级生成建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了InFlux基准数据集，为具有动态相机内参的视频提供逐帧真实内参标注，包含143K+标注帧和386个高分辨率视频，解决了现有基准缺乏动态内参变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数3D算法假设相机内参在视频中保持不变，但真实视频中内参经常变化，且现有基准缺乏动态内参变化和场景多样性。

Method: 构建了全面的校准实验查找表，扩展Kalibr工具箱以提高精度和鲁棒性，创建包含室内外视频的基准数据集。

Result: 评估现有基线方法发现大多数在动态内参视频上难以实现准确预测，证明了动态内参跟踪的挑战性。

Conclusion: InFlux基准填补了动态相机内参基准的空白，为开发更鲁棒的相机内参跟踪方法提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

*Yusu Qian,Cheng Wan,Chao Jia,Yinfei Yang,Qingyu Zhao,Zhe Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench是一个基于视觉谜题的基准测试，通过要求模型在包含一个错误的逐步推理链中识别第一个错误步骤，来评估多模态大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注最终答案准确性，但无法评估模型推理过程的逻辑一致性。需要一种诊断性评估来区分流畅生成和忠实推理。

Method: 设计包含符号、几何和类比推理的多步骤视觉谜题，要求模型在包含一个错误的推理链中定位第一个错误步骤。

Result: 评估发现最先进的多模态大语言模型在流畅生成和忠实推理之间存在持续差距，模型能生成看似合理的推理链但无法定位简单逻辑错误。

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench为多模态推理能力提供了更精确的评估视角，强调在开发可信赖多模态大语言模型时需要诊断性评估协议。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelRefer是一个统一的区域级多模态大语言模型框架，支持对图像和视频中用户指定区域进行细粒度理解。通过提出尺度自适应对象标记器(SAOT)和对象中心融合模块，实现了高效的对象级推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM主要关注整体场景理解，缺乏对细粒度、对象中心推理的支持。需要开发能够处理用户指定区域的精细理解能力。

Method: 提出Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT)从自由形式区域生成紧凑的对象表示；设计PixelRefer-Lite变体，使用Object-Centric Infusion模块将全局上下文预融合到对象标记中，形成轻量级Object-Only Framework。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PixelRefer以较少训练样本实现领先性能，PixelRefer-Lite在保持高准确性的同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: PixelRefer框架成功实现了细粒度的区域级视觉理解，在性能和效率方面都表现出色，为对象中心的多模态理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIRE方法通过视频跟踪、主题驱动的2D修复和3D重投影，显著提升了3D/4D生成中的身份保持能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D/4D生成方法在跨视角语义身份保持方面存在不足，个性化3D/4D生成研究尚不充分

Method: 使用现有3D生成模型的初始资产，通过视频跟踪识别需修改区域，采用主题驱动2D修复渐进填充，最后将修改后的多视角观测重投影回3D

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在3D/4D生成的身份保持方面显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: TIRE方法有效解决了3D/4D生成中的身份保持问题，为个性化3D/4D生成提供了新思路

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类通过多感官协同学习抽象概念的启发，旨在开发能够从单一模态回忆概念表示的模型。

Method: 结合3D模态内自蒸馏和2D-3D跨模态联合嵌入的简约框架。

Result: 在零样本可视化中学习到更连贯的空间特征；在线性探测中分别超越SOTA 2D和3D自监督模型14.2%和4.8%；在ScanNet上达到80.7% mIoU的新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Concerto能够产生具有优越细粒度几何和语义一致性的空间表示，支持开放世界感知。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

TL;DR: 政策优化算法在开放式的思维链结构中倾向于选择最简单路径，丢弃显式推理，直接输出答案，即使复杂格式被赋予更高奖励权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政策优化在放松严格思维链约束后的行为，探索其在开放式推理结构中的表现。

Method: 通过一系列受控实验和奖励分解实验，分析不同模型和算法在灵活推理-回答结构中的行为模式。

Result: 政策优化始终遵循最小阻力路径，即使复杂格式奖励权重提高4倍，仍会退化为直接答案格式。

Conclusion: 给予政策优化自由度是一把双刃剑：既能发现高奖励捷径，也容易导致奖励函数被简单利用，这对对齐任务构成挑战。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

TL;DR: 提出Language Ranker框架，将LLM解码过程类比推荐系统排序阶段，通过轻量级模块重排候选响应，在性能可比大型奖励模型的同时大幅降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM研究主要关注输出分布优化，而忽视了将分布转化为最终响应的解码过程。现有解码方法如奖励模型计算成本高且适用性有限。

Method: 将解码过程类比推荐系统排序阶段，提出Language Ranker框架，使用基础模型提取特征，通过轻量级模块（仅<0.5M参数）对候选响应进行重排。

Result: 在广泛任务上的实验表明，Language Ranker性能与大型奖励模型相当，同时显著降低了训练和推理阶段的计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且有效，展示了充分释放LLM潜力的潜力，为解码过程提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its
potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

### [214] [Framework for Machine Evaluation of Reasoning Completeness in Large Language Models For Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21884)
*Avinash Patil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE框架评估LLM生成解释与逻辑回归特征重要性之间的对齐程度，发现正确预测更关注支持特征，错误预测更关注矛盾特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，需要透明可解释的AI。虽然LLM能生成自然语言解释，但这些解释是否真实反映决策依据尚不清楚。

Method: 提出RACE框架，在四个文本分类数据集上比较LLM解释与逻辑回归的特征重要性，使用token匹配、精确字符串匹配和编辑距离匹配三种粒度方法。

Result: 实证结果显示一致的不对称性：正确预测包含更多支持特征，错误预测包含更多矛盾特征。编辑距离匹配发现释义重叠，提高了覆盖率但保持不对称性。

Conclusion: LLM解释结合了表面和灵活的证据重用，但在错误情况下会放大误导线索。RACE为评估LLM解释的忠实性提供了新见解和量化基础。

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has
heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial
intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of
producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these
rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions.
This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of
Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between
LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived
from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text
classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and
compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical
features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE
implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques.
Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit
higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are
associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance
matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while
preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales
combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify
misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the
faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for
evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

TL;DR: 提出行为感知采样框架，通过基于指令-响应行为和语义多样性的安全示例选择，有效缓解大语言模型在微调时的灾难性遗忘问题，仅需0.5%额外训练数据即可显著降低有害输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在良性数据微调时经常失去之前对齐的安全行为（灾难性遗忘），现有方法通过添加随机安全示例缓解此问题，但哪些示例最有效尚不明确。

Method: 提出行为感知采样框架，基于两个互补因素选择安全示例：指令-响应行为（如拒绝vs遵从）和跨伤害类别的语义多样性。

Result: 系统评估显示该方法显著减少有害输出同时保持帮助性，仅用0.5%额外训练数据即可实现高达41%的有害性降低。

Conclusion: 结果表明有针对性的数据选择可以大规模提高微调的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义各向同性的方法来评估LLM长文本响应的可信度，通过测量文本嵌入在单位球面上的分散程度来预测事实一致性，无需标注数据或调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要准确响应的关键应用领域部署LLM时，需要可靠且计算成本低的方法来评估长文本响应的可信度，而现有的逐项事实核查方法计算成本高且脆弱。

Method: 生成多个长文本响应，将其嵌入到向量空间，通过计算嵌入向量在单位球面上的角分散度来估计语义各向同性水平。

Result: 研究发现更高的语义各向同性（即更大的嵌入分散度）可靠地表明样本间的事实一致性较低。该方法在多个领域都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、低成本的信任评估方法，可集成到实际LLM工作流程中，无需标注数据、微调或超参数选择。

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

Motivation: 现代大规模网络配置复杂，传统基于领域特定语言的方法学习曲线陡峭且灵活性有限，而自然语言接口更易访问和解释。

Method: 采用树状配置分块策略保持语义连贯性，构建统一事实图来规范化厂商特定配置，设计混合命令-声明语言减轻LLM推理负担。

Result: 实验表明NetMind能够实现准确且可扩展的网络行为理解，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NetMind框架有效解决了LLM在网络配置分析中的三个关键挑战，为自然语言驱动的网络行为理解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding
network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed
to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically
relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While
effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In
contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable
interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior
understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance
this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts
and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1)
numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's
long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and
protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols
demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To
tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying
networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking
strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning.
We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to
normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid
imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and
enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer
pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind
achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming
existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出IterSurvey框架，通过递归大纲生成和迭代检索阅读过程，改进自动文献综述生成的质量，在内容覆盖、结构连贯性和引用质量方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动文献综述系统采用一次性检索和静态大纲生成，导致检索噪声大、结构碎片化和上下文过载，限制了综述质量。受人类研究者迭代阅读过程启发，需要更智能的生成方法。

Method: 基于递归大纲生成的框架，规划代理增量检索、阅读和更新大纲；设计论文卡片提炼每篇论文的贡献、方法和发现；引入审阅-精炼循环和可视化增强来改善文本流并整合多模态元素。

Result: 在既有和新兴主题上的实验表明，IterSurvey在内容覆盖、结构连贯性和引用质量方面显著优于最先进基线，生成更易访问和组织更好的综述。

Conclusion: IterSurvey通过迭代方法有效提升了自动文献综述的质量，并引入Survey-Arena基准来更可靠地评估机器生成综述相对于人工撰写综述的表现。

Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention,
yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of
papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting.
This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context
overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading
process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent
outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads,
and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide
faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper
into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a
review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow
and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on
both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and
citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys.
To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further
introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring
and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written
ones. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同语言在并行文本编码时的token数量差异（token premiums），通过训练约7000个单语分词器，分析了词汇量大小、预分词等因素对token premiums的影响，发现调整词汇量大小和预分词策略能显著减少跨语言token差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同语言在编码并行文本时存在token数量差异，这种差异会导致训练吞吐量降低和推理成本增加。研究旨在理解造成这些跨语言token差异的因素。

Method: 训练了约7000个可比较的单语分词器，涵盖97种语言，控制了分词算法、词汇量大小和数据集大小等因素，测量token premiums并分析数据相似性、词汇量、预分词等关系。

Result: 发现训练数据与测试数据的相似性不影响token premiums，但词汇量大小和预分词策略有显著影响。通过确定每种语言的"最优"词汇量可以显著减少token差异，使用超词分词器（允许跨空格合并）也能减少token差异并提高压缩率。

Conclusion: 通过干预词汇量大小或预分词器，可以显著减少跨语言token差异效应，从而提高训练效率和降低推理成本。

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

TL;DR: MATT是一种模型感知的分词器迁移方法，通过注意力影响建模目标将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，相比仅关注嵌入相似性的方法能更有效地进行分词器迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型支持的语言数量不断增加，但预定义的分词器成为适应低资源或不同文字语言的瓶颈。现有分词器迁移方法通常依赖语义启发式来初始化新嵌入，忽略了更高层的模型动态，限制了迁移质量。

Method: 提出MATT方法，将模型内部信息融入分词器迁移过程。引入注意力影响建模(AIM)目标，将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，为标准语言建模提供高效预热。

Result: 在多种语言设置下的实验表明，MATT在几个GPU小时内就能恢复原始模型性能的很大一部分，优于启发式基线方法。

Conclusion: 整合模型级信号为多语言LLM中的稳健分词器迁移提供了一条实用且有效的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

Method: 为每个作者从头训练一个GPT-2模型，然后比较这些模型在预测各自作者和其他作者文本时的准确性差异。

Result: 模型能够准确区分八位不同作者的写作风格，并成功确认了R. P. Thompson是《奥兹国》系列第15本书的真正作者。

Conclusion: 从头训练的GPT-2模型能够有效体现特定作者的写作风格，为作者身份识别提供了一种新的技术方法。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

Motivation: 虽然离散优化越狱攻击生成的短后缀具有可转移性，但学界缺乏对转移发生时机和原因的严格分析，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过大量实验识别与转移成功强相关的三个统计特性：无后缀提示激活拒绝方向的程度、后缀推离拒绝方向的强度、以及正交方向的偏移大小。

Result: 发现拒绝方向激活度、推离强度和正交偏移与转移成功强相关，而提示语义相似性仅弱相关，这些发现可用于提升攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对越狱攻击可转移性的细粒度理解，并通过干预实验展示了统计分析如何转化为实际攻击效果的提升。

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量评估指标在机器翻译中至关重要，但长度偏差的普遍性和影响尚未得到充分探索，这可能导致对较长正确翻译的不公平惩罚和次优决策。

Method: 对10种不同语言对的顶级回归基和LLM-as-a-Judge QE指标进行系统性研究，分析长度偏差现象，并提出长度归一化训练和引入参考文本评估两种缓解策略。

Result: 发现QE指标存在两种关键长度偏差：随着翻译长度增加持续高估错误（即使对高质量无错误文本），以及在多个候选翻译中偏好较短翻译。提出的两种策略都能有效减少长度偏差。

Conclusion: QE指标存在显著的长度偏差问题，可能影响翻译评估的公平性，但通过长度归一化和参考文本引入可以有效缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要集中在英语上，而最先进的AI模型需要服务数十亿国际用户，因此需要研究多语言环境下的缩放定律。

Method: 通过774个多语言训练实验，引入自适应迁移缩放定律(ATLAS)，分析多语言学习动态、语言间迁移特性，并推导跨语言迁移矩阵和语言无关缩放定律。

Result: ATLAS在样本外泛化方面比现有缩放定律表现更好，R²通常高出0.3以上；识别了38×38=1444个语言对的相互受益分数；找到了从头预训练与从多语言检查点微调的计算交叉点。

Conclusion: 这些发现为跨语言民主化缩放定律提供了科学基础，使从业者能够高效扩展模型，超越英语优先的AI范式。

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型内部如何表征情感，探索其隐藏状态空间中的情感几何结构，以理解模型如何内化和处理情感信息。

Method: 分析LLM隐藏状态空间的几何结构，识别低维情感流形，研究情感表征的方向性编码和跨层分布，并在八个真实世界情感数据集上进行跨域对齐验证。

Result: 发现了一个稳定的情感子空间，情感表征具有方向性编码特征，跨层分布且与可解释维度对齐。跨域对齐误差低，线性探测性能强，表明存在通用情感子空间。通过干预模块可以在保持语义的同时操控内部情感感知。

Conclusion: 大语言模型中存在一致且可操控的情感几何结构，这为理解模型如何内化和处理情感提供了重要见解，特别是在基础情感跨语言控制方面表现出色。

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

TL;DR: 该论文比较了六种减轻LLM性别偏见的方法，发现监督微调(SFT)在约束合规性和词汇多样性方面表现最佳，而基于偏好的方法(如DPO)无法满足组合约束要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型即使在职业中性语境下仍会产生性别刻板印象语言，反映了深层社会偏见。现有偏见缓解方法的比较效果和学习动态尚不明确。

Method: 比较分析了六种偏见缓解控制技术：仅提示、生成后过滤、基于DFA的Ctrl-G解码、监督微调(SFT)、直接偏好优化(DPO)和迭代零空间投影(INLP)，在组合约束任务上评估每种方法。

Result: SFT达到99.87%的合规性和高词汇多样性，DPO仅4.53%合规率。Ctrl-G保证完全合规但严重降低流畅性和多样性。偏好学习无法满足组合约束，只有显式监督能缓解组合偏见。

Conclusion: 偏好学习无法泛化逻辑结构，只有显式正监督才能实现公平流畅的受控生成，凸显了偏好学习的局限性和显式监督的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

*Xuanming Zhang*

TL;DR: 提出统一框架理解LLM的双重性：泛化与记忆，开发动态模式引导算法在推理时控制模型行为，提高逻辑一致性和事实准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM存在泛化能力和逐字记忆训练数据的双重性，这种不可预测性削弱了其在高风险应用中的可靠性

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理建立理论模型，开发动态模式引导算法，包含轻量级因果线性探针识别记忆依赖，以及动态激活引导机制将计算推向泛化电路

Result: 在推理和忠实性任务上的实验表明，DMS显著提高了逻辑一致性和事实准确性

Conclusion: DMS为增强LLM可靠性提供了一种原则性方法，通过推理时干预控制模型行为

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

*Billy Dickson,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种对数压缩输入表示的方法来增强transformer的长上下文处理能力，而不是修改模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数长上下文处理方法通过增加复杂度（如循环或辅助记忆模块）来改进transformer架构，本文寻求一种更简单的方法。

Method: 对输入token应用尺度不变的对数压缩，生成压缩表示后由标准transformer处理，保持架构简单性。

Result: 在WikiText-103和PG-19语言建模基准测试中，相比未压缩基线降低了困惑度，且性能随压缩时间上下文长度增加而持续提升。

Conclusion: 输入级对数压缩是扩展transformer长程记忆的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在构建一个能够从数百亿参数扩展到万亿参数的统一推理导向语言基础模型，强调通过稀疏激活来提升推理能力，同时保持跨规模的一致性和效率。

Method: 采用高稀疏度MoE架构和MTP技术进行高效推理，结合推理导向数据、训练中思维链激活、基于强化的微调(DFT、Evo-CoT)，以及全规模FP8训练和细粒度异构流水线。

Result: Ling-1T在万亿参数规模上建立了推理准确性与计算效率的新帕累托前沿，稀疏激活与推理目标对齐实现了可扩展且高效的人工智能。

Conclusion: Ling 2.0为推进未来推理和思维模型提供了一个连贯、开放且高效的基础，包括基于相同基础的Ring系列模型。

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的智能客服系统存在幻觉问题和回答机械化，这会带来业务风险并影响用户体验，特别是在Web客服场景中。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) Learn-to-Think阶段学习人类专家的推理过程和响应策略；2) Learn-to-Respond阶段结合冷启动监督微调和强化学习进行从基础到困难的自优化。

Result: 在工业级社交客服环境中进行大规模在线A/B测试，在社区支持/直播互动场景中分别实现智能解决率+28.92%/+18.42%和人工接管率-6.08%/-7.12%的显著提升。

Conclusion: OlaMind框架在不同真实应用场景中展现出一致的有效性，显著提升了智能客服的人类相似性和自然度，同时有效缓解了幻觉和关键业务风险。

Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms
and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency.
However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to
hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can
introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based
customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service
framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a
Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies
from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform
cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning
(RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances
human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and
critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments
in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive
experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative
improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human
takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction
scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across
diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

*Rahul Ranjan,Mahendra Kumar Gurve,Anuj,Nitin,Yamuna Prasad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含3221个迈蒂利语句的新数据集，该数据集标注了情感极性并配有自然语言解释，旨在解决低资源语言在可解释情感分析方面资源匮乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迈蒂利语作为印度-雅利安语系语言，拥有超过1300万使用者，但在自然语言处理研究中代表性不足。低资源语言的情感分析资源稀缺，通常缺乏细粒度标注和可解释性机制。

Method: 构建了包含3221个迈蒂利语句的数据集，每个句子都标注了情感极性并配有自然语言解释。数据集经过语言学专家精心策划和验证，确保标签可靠性和上下文保真度。解释文本使用迈蒂利语编写，促进文化基础解释。

Result: 使用经典机器学习和最先进的transformer架构进行的广泛实验证明了该数据集在可解释情感分析方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为迈蒂利语建立了首个可解释情感计算的基准，为多语言NLP和可解释AI的广泛发展贡献了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for
interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first
benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a
valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and
explainable AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DETECT，首个德语专用文本简化评估指标，通过LLM生成合成质量分数训练，在简化性、意义保留和流畅性三个维度上优于现有通用指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前德语自动文本简化评估依赖通用指标如SARI、BLEU等，无法充分捕捉简化质量。英语已有专用指标如LENS，但德语缺乏相应工具和人工标注语料。

Method: 基于LENS框架适配德语，通过LLM生成合成质量分数创建数据集，无需人工标注，并增加LLM驱动的评分标准对齐步骤。

Result: DETECT与人类评价的相关性显著高于现有ATS指标，在意义保留和流畅性方面提升尤其明显。

Conclusion: DETECT填补了德语文本简化评估的空白，同时展示了LLM在自动评估中的潜力和局限性，为通用语言可访问性任务提供了可转移指南。

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

*Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种测量LLM在成对文本比较中输出错误的方法，通过Copeland计数构建文本排名来估计错误率，并在六个主流LLM上进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要量化LLM在成对文本比较任务中的错误率，且不依赖真实标签，同时考虑位置偏差的影响。

Method: 使用两种场景估计错误率：(i)均匀错误率，通过每个文本对的两次比较；(ii)二元位置偏差，假设不同比较顺序有不同错误率，通过重复比较估计。采用Copeland计数构建文本排名。

Result: 在六个LLM（ChatGPT、Claude、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Qwen）和五种文本类型上获得一致的错误率估计。两个位置偏差项相似，接近均匀错误。Claude表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在指示LLM错误方面优于有偏Bradley-Terry模型和交换性得分，Claude在错误率和提示鲁棒性方面表现最优。

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Swadesh方法在估计语言时间分离时的局限性，指出即使所有基本假设都满足，数学上仍存在精度限制。同时提出了词汇渐进修改过程的重要性，并证明考虑这一随机过程能显著提高时间分离估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swadesh方法的基本假设往往不现实，存在各种污染现象和误判问题。更重要的是，即使所有假设都满足，数学上对时间分离估计的精度也存在固有限制，这些概率性限制在词汇统计学研究中常被忽视。

Method: 详细分析了Swadesh方法的概率性限制，并引入了词汇渐进修改这一随机过程。从纯概率角度证明了考虑这一过程对提高估计精度的重要性。

Result: 揭示了Swadesh方法在估计语言时间分离时的固有精度限制，证明了词汇渐进修改过程对词汇演变的重要贡献，并展示了考虑这一过程能显著提高时间分离估计的精度。

Conclusion: 语言词汇演变不仅受词汇替换过程驱动，还受词汇渐进修改过程影响。考虑这两种随机过程能显著提高语言时间分离估计的精度，这对词汇统计学研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

TL;DR: Sculpting是一种基于规则的约束提示方法，旨在通过减少语义模糊性和常识错误来改进标准CoT提示。研究发现存在"提示反转"现象：Sculpting在中等模型上有优势，但在更先进模型上反而有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CoT提示存在语义模糊性和常识错误的问题，需要开发更精确的提示方法来提高LLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出"Sculpting"方法，这是一种基于规则的约束提示技术。在GSM8K数学推理基准上评估了三种提示策略（零样本、标准CoT、Sculpting）在三个OpenAI模型上的表现。

Result: 发现"提示反转"现象：Sculpting在gpt-4o上表现更好（97% vs 93%），但在gpt-5上反而有害（94.00% vs 96.36%）。这是由于"护栏到手铐"的转变，约束在先进模型中引发过度字面化。

Conclusion: 最优提示策略必须与模型能力共同进化，对更强大的模型应使用更简单的提示方法。

Abstract: Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. We introduce "Sculpting," a
constrained, rule-based prompting method designed to improve upon standard CoT
by reducing errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense.
  We evaluate three prompting strategies (Zero Shot, standard CoT, and
Sculpting) across three OpenAI model generations (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5)
using the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (1,317 problems).
  Our findings reveal a "Prompting Inversion": Sculpting provides advantages on
gpt-4o (97% vs. 93% for standard CoT), but becomes detrimental on gpt-5 (94.00%
vs. 96.36% for CoT on full benchmark). We trace this to a
"Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition where constraints preventing common-sense
errors in mid-tier models induce hyper-literalism in advanced models. Our
detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must
co-evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more capable
models.

TL;DR: SteerX是一种解耦的激活引导方法，通过因果推断识别用户偏好驱动的token，生成更准确的引导向量来个性化LLM输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法使用所有历史数据计算引导向量，但并非所有内容都反映真实用户偏好，这会削弱个性化信号。

Method: 基于因果推断理论，SteerX估计token级因果效应来识别偏好驱动的token，将这些离散信号转换为连贯描述，然后用于引导个性化LLM生成。

Result: 在两个代表性引导骨干方法和真实数据集上的实验表明，SteerX持续提升引导向量质量。

Conclusion: SteerX通过关注真正偏好驱动的信息，提供了一种更有效的LLM个性化实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years,
enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that
support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

Method: 构建PatenTEB基准，采用领域分层分割、领域特定难负样本挖掘，并系统覆盖非对称片段到文档匹配场景；通过多任务训练开发patembed模型家族（67M-344M参数，最长4096 token上下文）。

Result: patembed-base在MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2上达到0.494 V-measure（之前最佳为0.445），patembed-large在DAPFAM上达到0.377 NDCG@100；多任务训练显著提升外部泛化能力，领域预训练初始化在各任务家族中提供一致优势。

Conclusion: PatenTEB基准填补了专利嵌入评估的空白，patembed模型在专利相关任务上表现出色，多任务训练和领域预训练是提升专利嵌入性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external
generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained
initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All

Result: 实验表明，考虑到大学课程材料规模相对较小，RAG比CPT更有效且高效；将幻灯片作为图像整合到多模态设置中，比纯文本检索显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更好地支持学习和教学的AI助手提供了实用策略，并希望激励其他教育场景的类似努力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

### [240] [Supervised Fine-Tuning or In-Context Learning? Evaluating LLMs for Clinical NER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22285)
*Andrei Baroian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较了BERT类编码器、GPT-4o少样本学习和GPT-4o监督微调在临床命名实体识别任务上的表现，发现监督微调效果最佳但成本较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同方法在临床命名实体识别任务上的性能差异，特别是比较传统BERT模型与大语言模型的表现。

Method: 使用CADEC语料库，比较三类方法：(1) BERT类编码器(BERT Base、BioClinicalBERT、RoBERTa-large)；(2) GPT-4o少样本学习，使用简单和复杂提示；(3) GPT-4o监督微调。评估五种实体类型(ADR、药物、疾病、症状、发现)的标准NER指标。

Result: RoBERTa-large和BioClinicalBERT相比BERT Base提升有限；简单提示的少样本学习优于复杂提示；监督微调达到最佳性能(F1≈87.1%)但成本较高；大语言模型在简化任务(二分类)上准确率更高。

Conclusion: 监督微调在临床NER任务中表现最佳，但大语言模型在简化任务上具有优势，提示设计对少样本学习效果有重要影响。

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

Abstract: We present memory-based language modeling as an efficient, eco-friendly
alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers
log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization
capabilities. Implementing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor
classification, memory-based language modeling leaves a relatively small
ecological footprint both in training and in inference mode, as it relies fully
on CPUs and attains low token latencies. Its internal workings are simple and
fully transparent. We compare our implementation of memory-based language
modeling, OLIFANT, with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on next-token prediction accuracy,
estimated emissions and speeds, and offer some deeper analyses of the model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多语言目标立场提取（TSE）基准，涵盖加泰罗尼亚语、爱沙尼亚语、法语、意大利语、普通话和西班牙语语料库，无需为每种语言单独训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体数据可用于分析争议问题上的公众意见，但现有的目标立场提取研究仅限于英语，缺乏多语言基准。

Method: 将原始TSE流程扩展到多语言设置，使用统一模型处理多种语言，无需为每种语言单独训练模型。

Result: 模型管道获得了12.78的F1分数，表明多语言任务相比英语设置难度显著增加，目标预测是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多语言TSE提供了急需的资源、算法和评估标准基准，并首次证明了TSE的F1分数对不同目标表述的敏感性。

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Majid Asgari-Bidhendi,Behrooz Minaei-Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAIR-RAG是一个新型的代理框架，通过结构化证据评估和迭代精炼机制，解决了复杂多跳查询中证据不完整的问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG框架在处理需要从不同来源综合信息的复杂多跳查询时表现不佳，缺乏系统识别和填补证据差距的机制，容易传播噪声或收集不全面的上下文。

Method: FAIR-RAG将标准RAG流水线转变为动态、证据驱动的推理过程，核心是结构化证据评估(SEA)模块和迭代精炼循环。SEA将初始查询分解为所需发现清单，识别确认事实和明确的信息差距，然后自适应查询精炼代理生成针对性子查询来检索缺失信息。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MusiQue等挑战性多跳QA基准测试中，FAIR-RAG显著优于强基线。在HotpotQA上获得0.453的F1分数，比最强的迭代基线绝对提升8.3分，在这些基准上建立了该类方法的新SOTA。

Conclusion: 具有明确差距分析的结构化、证据驱动的精炼过程对于在高级RAG系统中实现复杂知识密集型任务的可靠准确推理至关重要。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and
knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often
falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from
disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or
adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and
fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a
comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that
transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning
process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we
term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating
mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required
findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and,
critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to
an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries
to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is
verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly
faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA
benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified
experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On
HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3
points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new
state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work
demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with
explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning
in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了VisJudge-Bench，首个用于评估多模态大语言模型在可视化美学和质量评估能力的基准，包含3,090个专家标注样本。研究发现现有MLLMs与人类专家存在显著差距，为此提出了专门的可视化评估模型VisJudge，显著提升了评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化质量评估具有挑战性，需要同时考虑数据编码准确性、信息表达性和视觉美学。虽然MLLMs在自然图像美学评估中表现良好，但缺乏针对可视化评估的系统性基准。

Method: 构建VisJudge-Bench基准，包含3,090个专家标注的真实场景样本，涵盖32种图表类型。提出专门的可视化评估模型VisJudge。

Result: 最先进的MLLMs（如GPT-5）与人类专家存在显著差距（MAE=0.551，相关性仅0.429）。VisJudge显著缩小了这一差距，将MAE降至0.442（减少19.8%），与人类专家一致性提升至0.681（提高58.7%）。

Conclusion: VisJudge-Bench填补了可视化评估基准的空白，VisJudge模型在可视化美学和质量评估方面显著优于通用MLLMs，为可视化质量自动评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

TL;DR: CHOIR是一个测试时框架，通过协调多个角色条件推理信号来提升LLM推理的鲁棒性，无需额外训练即可显著改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLM在角色分配时，即使是简单的人称代词变化也会导致推理轨迹和正确答案的差异。与其将这些变化视为需要消除的偏差，不如将其作为提升推理鲁棒性的建设性资源。

Method: 提出CHOIR框架，在反事实角色之间进行协作解码，动态平衡推理路径中的一致性和分歧，将多个角色条件推理信号协调为统一预测。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，CHOIR在不同人口统计群体、模型架构、规模和任务上都持续提升性能，对个体人口统计群体的改进最高达26.4%，五个群体的平均改进为19.2%。即使在基础角色不理想的情况下也保持有效。

Conclusion: 通过将角色变化重新定义为建设性信号，CHOIR为更可靠的LLM推理提供了可扩展和泛化的方法。

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

Method: 通过测量音高操作对自动语音识别性能的影响，分析藏语方言对音高平坦化的敏感度

Result: 发现声调产生的连续统：无音调安多方言对音高移除最容忍，完全音调卫藏方言性能严重下降，中间康方言介于两者之间

Conclusion: 计算方法能捕捉声音变化的精细阶段，传统基于最小对立对的功能负荷指标可能高估过渡系统中对音高的依赖

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试上，该方法在相同剪枝比例和不同设置下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能无缝集成各种基础剪枝技术，在压缩过程中保留LLM的专门能力，是一种简单有效的剪枝方法。

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

Motivation: 研究多语言ASR模型在不同语言中学习到的子词库利用情况，以及预训练数据差异是否影响推理时的子词使用模式。

Method: 通过记录49种语言推理时的解码候选子词，跟踪其随时间累积发现情况，分析模型子词空间的利用模式。

Result: 发现子词总数与语言预训练小时数无关，子词发现率遵循一致的指数饱和模式，拉丁文字语言比西里尔、CJK和闪米特文字表现更好。

Conclusion: 多语言ASR推理中的子词利用更多受语言统计、类型和正字法结构约束，而非训练数据规模，为更公平的语料构建和跨语言评估提供实证基础。

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned
sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific

speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,

differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

*Noshitha Padma Pratyusha Juttu,Sahithi Singireddy,Sravani Gona,Sujal Timilsina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在服务条款文档中进行不公平条款检测时，完全微调、参数高效适应（LoRA、QLoRA）和零样本提示策略的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本理解方面取得了显著进展，但在专业法律领域的适应仍受到完全微调成本的限制。

Method: 对BERT和DistilBERT进行完全微调，对TinyLlama、LLaMA 3B/7B和SaulLM等模型应用4位低秩适应（LoRA），并在零样本设置下评估GPT-4o及其变体。

Result: 在CLAUDETTE-ToS基准和多语言爬取语料库上的实验表明，完全微调实现了最强的精确率-召回率平衡，而基于LoRA的模型提供了具有竞争力的召回率，且内存成本降低了3倍。

Conclusion: 这些发现突出了高效和领域适应LLMs的实际设计权衡，为法律文本处理中的微调研究提供了开放的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text understanding, yet their
adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full
fine-tuning. This study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning,
parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting
strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a
key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

*Ziyuan He,Yuxuan Wang,Jiaqi Li,Kexin Liang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LooGLE v2是一个评估大语言模型在真实世界长文本应用场景中长上下文理解能力的新基准测试，涵盖法律、金融、游戏和代码等领域，测试结果显示当前最佳模型仅达到59.2%的总体得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型虽然上下文窗口不断扩展，但其在长依赖任务中的长上下文理解能力仍存在根本性限制且研究不足，特别是在许多真实世界长上下文应用中缺乏基准测试。

Method: 构建LooGLE v2基准测试，包含自动收集的16k到2M tokens的真实世界长文本，精心设计10种领域特定的长依赖任务类型，通过可扩展的数据处理流程生成1,934个多样化和复杂度的问答实例。

Result: 对6个本地部署和4个API基础的大语言模型进行全面评估，结果显示即使最佳模型在基准测试中也仅达到59.2%的总体得分，表明流行LLM实际能理解的上下文长度远低于其声称的能力。

Conclusion: 尽管上下文窗口广泛扩展，流行大语言模型处理真实世界长依赖任务的能力存在显著局限性，揭示了在实际长上下文理解方面模型改进的广阔空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

### [255] [SABlock: Semantic-Aware KV Cache Eviction with Adaptive Compression Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22556)
*Jinhan Chen,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Xianjun Gao,Shilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABlock是一个语义感知的KV缓存驱逐框架，通过自适应块大小来平衡语义连贯性和内存效率，显著减少长上下文LLM推理中的KV缓存内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存不断增长的内存占用成为长上下文LLM推理的严重可扩展性瓶颈，现有压缩方法难以平衡语义连贯性和内存效率。

Method: SABlock首先进行语义分割以对齐压缩边界与语言结构，然后应用分段引导的token评分来优化token重要性估计，最后通过预算驱动的搜索策略自适应确定最优块大小。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试中，SABlock在相同内存预算下始终优于最先进的基线方法。在NIAH测试中，仅用96个KV条目就达到99.9%的检索准确率，在固定缓存预算1024下减少峰值内存使用46.28%，并在128K上下文长度下实现高达9.5倍的解码加速。

Conclusion: SABlock通过语义感知的自适应块大小策略，有效解决了KV缓存内存占用问题，在保持语义完整性的同时显著提高了压缩效率和解码速度。

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EduLoop-Agent端到端个性化学习代理，集成神经认知诊断模型、自适应测试策略和LLM，形成诊断-推荐-反馈闭环框架，在ASSISTments数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将建模、题目选择和反馈孤立处理，导致学生模型粗糙、自适应策略受限、反馈不具操作性，需要构建端到端的闭环个性化学习系统。

Method: 结合神经认知诊断模型(NCD)提供细粒度知识掌握评估，边界能力估计自适应测试(BECAT)动态选择题目，LLM生成结构化可操作反馈，形成诊断-推荐-反馈闭环。

Result: NCD模块在响应预测上表现优异且可解释，自适应推荐策略提高题目相关性和个性化，LLM反馈提供针对性学习指导，整体设计有效且可部署。

Conclusion: 该设计为智能教育中生成个性化学习轨迹提供了可行路径，通过闭环框架实现了更有效的个性化学习体验。

Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from
one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most
methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than
as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models,
assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic,
non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an
end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation
Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models
(LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at
the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to
maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals
into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a
closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance
on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The
adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization,
and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with
identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design
is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to
generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型的成功加速了基于大语言模型的智能辅导系统发展，但这些系统的进展和影响难以追踪，因为缺乏可靠、通用且基于教学理论的评估框架和基准。现有评估多依赖主观协议和非标准化基准，导致不一致性和有限泛化性。

Method: 通过回顾最先进的评估实践，结合真实案例研究分析相关挑战，并基于跨学科AIED研究的见解，提出三个实用可行的研究方向。

Result: 识别了当前智能辅导系统评估中的主要问题：主观性、非标准化、缺乏教学理论基础，导致评估结果不一致且难以泛化。

Conclusion: 需要建立基于学习科学原理的公平、统一和可扩展的评估方法，以推动智能辅导系统的健康发展。提出了三个具体研究方向来实现这一目标。

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoBench是一个通过相互同行评估来评估大型语言模型的自动化框架，采用动态生成任务和多角色轮换机制，解决了传统静态基准测试的测试集污染和适应性有限问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态基准测试存在测试集污染和适应性有限的问题，需要一种能够持续评估不断发展的语言模型的动态评估方法。

Method: 采用相互同行评估框架，模型交替担任问题生成器、参赛者和评委角色，通过迭代加权机制聚合同行判断形成共识排名。

Result: 实验显示与MMLU-Pro和GPQA基准测试有强相关性（分别为78%和63%），多评委设计显著优于单评委基线，产生更稳健和人类一致的评估。

Conclusion: AutoBench为持续评估发展的语言模型提供了一个可扩展、抗污染的替代方案，优于静态基准测试。

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Motivation: 基于数字基础设施和生物医学创新的成功经验，旨在解决传统医疗的间歇性问题，提供持续、个性化的健康管理。

Method: 采用多模态智能体、事件中心建模和上下文推理技术，整合个人感知、体验计算和群体分析，构建环境自适应伴侣系统。

Result: PCU系统具备三个核心能力：个性化可信健康信息、主动健康导航和行为指导、持续治疗反应解读。

Conclusion: PCU代表了从间歇性医疗向持续健康指导的范式转变，有望改善个人健康结果，并为公共卫生和科学发现提供新平台。

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical
innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system
for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility
that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to
assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents,
event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential
capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2)
proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing
interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike
conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion -
observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By
integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level
analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a
new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the
architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging
paradigm.

Motivation: 创建波斯语常识推理基准，填补波斯语大规模常识推理数据集的空白，推动波斯语自然语言处理的发展。

Method: 使用连接词分割策略生成句子补全对，提出DRESS-AF方法通过嵌入相似性评分和对抗过滤从正确答案池中选择干扰项。

Result: 人类标注者准确率89%，OpenAI-o3达到92.18%，Claude-Sonnet-3.7为91.17%，最强开源模型DeepSeek-R1为82.51%。DRESS-AF方法在英语HellaSwag基准上也有效。

Conclusion: PerCoR是一个具有挑战性的波斯语常识推理基准，展示了当前模型在波斯语常识推理上的性能差距，DRESS-AF方法可有效提升数据集难度。

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale
Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K
multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news,
cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based
segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling
broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we
propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and
Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Preserving linguistic diversity is necessary as every language offers a
distinct perspective on the world. There have been numerous global initiatives
to preserve endangered languages through documentation. This paper is a part of
a project which aims to develop a trilingual (Toto-Bangla-English) language
learning application to digitally archive and promote the endangered Toto
language of West Bengal, India. This application, designed for both native Toto
speakers and non-native learners, aims to revitalize the language by ensuring
accessibility and usability through Unicode script integration and a structured
language corpus. The research includes detailed linguistic documentation
collected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged,
trilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a
Transformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional
morphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood
distinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect
word-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also
developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for
preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic
methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological
innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for
community-based language revitalization.

Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉复杂关系模式并缓解数据稀疏性，这限制了少样本知识图谱补全的性能

Method: 使用邻域聚合编码器整合高阶邻居信息，共轭关系学习器结合隐式条件扩散关系模块和稳定关系模块，以及流形共轭解码器在流形空间进行高效评估和推理

Result: 在三个基准测试上实现了优于现有最先进方法的性能

Conclusion: CR-FKGC框架通过共轭关系建模有效解决了FKGC中的关键挑战，展示了优越的性能

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG技术在LLM中的广泛应用，需要解释模型如何利用检索到的信息源来生成输出，但现有方法无法有效解释RAG系统的输出来源。

Method: 提出基于Apriori剪枝思想的优化算法，通过分析不同检索源组合对LLM输出的影响来生成解释规则，避免暴力枚举所有可能的源组合。

Result: 通过定性和定量实验验证了所提解决方案的价值和效率，能够有效解释RAG系统中检索源与模型输出之间的关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为解释RAG增强的LLM系统提供了有效的规则生成框架，能够揭示检索信息如何影响模型决策过程。

Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if
employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal
to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to
incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管指令调优的大语言模型具有强大的泛化能力，但在文本分类基准测试中表现不佳，需要改进其分类性能。

Method: 将每个类别标签映射到不同的输出标记，构建提示以引出单标记响应，在推理时仅将模型输出投影到相关类别标记的logits上。

Result: SALSA在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了其在基于LLM的分类应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: SALSA提供了一种有效的方法来提升大语言模型在文本分类任务中的性能，通过结构化提示和参数高效微调实现了优异的分类效果。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, instruction-tuned Large
Language Models often underperform on text classification benchmarks. We
introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting,
class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding
cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class
tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward
pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks,
demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification
applications.

Motivation: 现有文本嵌入模型在检索应用中效率高但排序保真度有限，而专门的LLM列表重排序器虽然性能更好但计算成本高。需要一种既能保持效率又能提升排序性能的统一方法。

Method: 使用查询和候选文档构建列表排序提示作为增强查询，通过余弦相似度作为统一排序函数，在列表排序目标下继续训练单个嵌入模型。

Result: 在BEIR重排序基准上达到SOTA结果，在BRIGHT推理密集型基准上表现有竞争力，重排序延迟很低，且在MTEB基准上嵌入性能也有所提升。

Conclusion: 单个嵌入模型可以有效统一检索和重排序任务，在提供计算效率的同时获得有竞争力的排序准确性。

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

TL;DR: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)和计算高效的持续预训练，在有限数据和计算预算下将大语言模型适配到魁北克法语方言，仅更新不到1%的参数即可在少数方言基准上获得提升，同时最小化对主流语言的回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的能力主要局限于高资源语言，而低资源方言缺乏训练数据。本文研究如何在有限数据和计算预算下通过持续预训练将LLM适配到区域方言，为少数语言社区提供高质量LLM访问。

Method: 采用低秩适应(LoRA)和计算高效的持续预训练方法，使用极小数据集将三个LLM适配到魁北克法语方言，并在COLE套件上进行基准测试。

Result: 实验显示在少数方言基准上获得改进，同时对主流语言基准的回归最小，仅更新不到1%的模型参数。结果分析表明增益高度依赖于语料库组成。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调的持续预训练可以通过成本效益高且可持续的语言资源创建来缩小方言差距，扩大少数语言社区对高质量LLM的访问。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can
narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language
resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic
communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的时间偏差，发现模型在预测下一个token时倾向于选择序列开头或结尾附近重复出现的token，而非中间位置的token，这与人类情景记忆的时间分离机制类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大型语言模型如何像人类情景记忆一样，通过时间分离来检索上下文信息，理解模型在时间维度上的信息处理偏好。

Method: 通过在序列中固定重复token的位置并置换其他token，消除语义干扰，专门研究时间因素对下一个token预测的影响。使用transformer和状态空间模型进行对比分析。

Result: 模型普遍对序列开头或结尾附近的重复token赋予最高预测概率，中间位置的记忆检索可靠性较低。transformer模型的这种现象与归纳头机制相关，状态空间模型也表现出类似的时间偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了上下文学习中存在的时间偏差，这种偏差有助于实现时间分离和情景检索，加深了对模型信息处理机制的理解。

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

TL;DR: EchoMind是首个多层级基准测试，通过顺序任务评估语音语言模型在共情对话中的表现，发现现有模型在处理高表达性语音线索方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估语言、声学、推理或对话能力，忽视了这些技能整合对实现类人、情感智能对话的重要性。

Method: 设计EchoMind基准测试，包含口语内容理解、语音线索感知、综合推理和响应生成四个顺序任务，使用语义中性脚本和受控的语音风格变化。

Result: 测试12个先进SLM发现，即使最先进的模型也难以处理高表达性语音线索，限制了共情响应质量，在指令遵循、自然语音变化适应性和语音线索有效利用方面存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够整合语言内容和多样化语音线索的SLM，以实现真正的共情对话能力。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

TL;DR: MMPersuade是一个研究大型视觉语言模型在多模态说服场景中表现的系统框架，发现多模态输入显著增强说服效果，不同说服策略在不同情境下效果各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LVLMs在购物、健康、新闻等领域的部署，它们会接触到大量说服性内容。理解模型如何作为被说服者受到多模态输入的影响至关重要，因为过于容易被说服的模型可能采纳误导性信念、覆盖用户偏好或生成不道德输出。

Method: 提出了MMPersuade框架，包括：(i)包含图像和视频的多模态数据集，涵盖商业、主观行为及对抗性情境下的说服原则；(ii)通过第三方一致性评分和对话历史中自估计token概率来量化说服效果和模型易感性的评估框架。

Result: 对六个领先LVLMs的研究发现：(i)多模态输入相比纯文本显著提高说服效果和模型易感性，尤其在错误信息场景；(ii)声明的先前偏好降低易感性，但多模态信息仍保持说服优势；(iii)不同策略在不同情境下效果不同，互惠在商业和主观情境最有效，可信度和逻辑在对抗性情境占优。

Conclusion: 通过联合分析说服效果和易感性，MMPersuade为开发在面对说服性多模态内容时具有鲁棒性、偏好一致性和伦理对齐的模型提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

TL;DR: R4P是一个基于推理的补丁验证模型，为软件工程代理提供可扩展的奖励机制，解决了传统基于测试的监督方法在可扩展性和稳定性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于测试的监督方法存在两个问题：(1) 构建和运行测试沙盒既繁重又脆弱；(2) 具有高覆盖率测试的数据稀缺且容易受到通过边缘案例进行的测试攻击威胁。

Method: R4P将补丁验证视为推理任务，模仿人类仓库维护者在不编写和运行新测试的情况下审查补丁的方式。采用分组目标进行强化学习训练，能够验证多个补丁之间的修改并获得密集奖励以实现稳定训练。

Result: R4P在SWE-bench-verified上达到72.2%的补丁验证准确率，超越了OpenAI o3。基于R4P训练的Mini-SE在SWE-bench-verified上达到26.2%的Pass@1，比原始Qwen3-32B提高了10.0%。R4P验证补丁的速度比平均测试快50倍，仅需不到一秒。

Conclusion: R4P通过推理驱动的补丁验证提供了可扩展的奖励机制，显著提升了软件工程代理的性能和训练效率，展示了在实际应用中的实用性。

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks,
the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the
potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and
running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with
high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge
cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide
scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider
that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human
repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new
reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of
reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to
verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense
reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from
SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we
design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning
where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2%
Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original
Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time
scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than
testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along
with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了商业和开源大语言模型在七种语言上的人权侵犯检测性能，发现模型对齐而非规模决定了跨语言稳定性，为资源受限的人道组织提供了成本-可靠性权衡的实证指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人道组织面临关键选择：投资昂贵的商业API还是依赖免费开源模型进行多语言人权监控。商业系统提供可靠性，但开源替代方案缺乏实证验证——特别是在冲突地区常见的低资源语言上。

Method: 在78,000次多语言推理中评估了六个模型（四个指令对齐模型和两个开源模型），使用标准分类指标和新的跨语言可靠性衡量标准：校准偏差、决策偏差、语言鲁棒性得分和语言稳定性得分。

Result: 结果显示对齐而非规模决定稳定性：对齐模型在类型学上遥远和低资源语言（如林加拉语、缅甸语）上保持近乎不变的准确性和平衡校准，而开源模型表现出显著的提示语言敏感性和校准漂移。

Conclusion: 多语言对齐实现了语言无关的推理，为平衡预算约束与多语言部署可靠性的人道组织提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,
GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both
standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂多步推理方面仍有困难，现有的CoT和PoT方法虽然能提升性能，但在算法领域经常产生不理想的解决方案。

Method: PIPS在实例级别生成和优化程序，使用结构反馈而不依赖任务特定指导或显式测试用例，并通过置信度指标动态选择直接推理或程序合成。

Result: 在3个前沿LLM和30个基准测试中，PIPS相比PoT和CoT分别提升绝对调和平均准确率8.6%和9.4%，在算法任务中比PoT减少65.1%的不良程序生成。

Conclusion: PIPS通过实例级程序合成和结构反馈，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的性能，同时减少了不良解决方案的产生。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with
Gemini-2.0-Flash.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型内部表示高度"纠缠"，混合了词汇、句法、语义和推理信息，这导致传统脑编码分析偏向浅层语言特征，难以分离深层认知过程的神经基础。

Method: 通过探测语言模型识别特征特定层，迭代回归掉低层表示，生成四个正交嵌入：词汇、句法、语义和推理。使用这些解缠嵌入建模颅内脑电图记录。

Result: 1) 推理嵌入具有独特预测能力，解释其他语言特征无法解释的神经活动方差；2) 推理神经信号时间上较晚出现(350-400ms)；3) 标准LLM嵌入具有误导性，其预测成功主要归因于浅层语言特征。

Conclusion: 解缠方法成功分离了语言处理的不同层次，揭示了推理过程的独特神经特征，表明标准LLM嵌入可能掩盖深层认知处理的贡献。

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出不受欢迎的不确定性，这种行为会破坏信任并在高风险领域带来严重风险。本研究旨在探究驱动这一现象的机制。

Method: 采用Needle-in-a-Haystack检索框架，集成Flip式重新评估提示来模拟真实的答案翻转场景。识别并屏蔽对误导性标记过度关注的小部分非检索注意力头。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本越来越像人类写作，需要大规模、多样化的标注数据集来可靠检测AI生成文本并将其归因到特定模型。

Method: 构建包含真实纽约时报文章和由Gemma-2-9b、Mistral-7B、Qwen-2-72B、LLaMA-8B、Yi-Large、GPT-4-o等先进LLM生成的合成文本的综合数据集。

Result: 建立了两个关键任务的基线结果：区分人类写作与AI生成文本的准确率为58.35%，将AI文本归因到生成模型的准确率为8.92%。

Conclusion: 该数据集通过连接真实世界新闻内容与现代生成模型，旨在促进鲁棒检测和归因方法的发展，在生成AI时代培养信任和透明度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
human-like AI-generated text, raising concerns about content authenticity,
misinformation, and trustworthiness. Addressing the challenge of reliably
detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires
large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a
comprehensive dataset comprising over 58,000 text samples that combine
authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B,
Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as
prompts, full human-authored narratives. We establish baseline results for two
key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an
accuracy of 58.35\%, and attributing AI texts to their generating models with
an accuracy of 8.92\%. By bridging real-world journalistic content with modern
generative models, the dataset aims to catalyze the development of robust
detection and attribution methods, fostering trust and transparency in the era
of generative AI. Our dataset is available at:

*Ranran Haoran Zhang,Soumik Dey,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EQSPEC和EXSPEC两种批量推测解码方法，解决了批量处理中的不规则张量问题，在保持输出等价性的同时显著提升了推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的批量推测解码实现存在输出不等价问题，主要由于不规则张量问题导致位置ID、注意力掩码和KV缓存状态损坏。

Method: EQSPEC方法通过正确性优先的批量推测解码暴露重新对齐开销；EXSPEC方法维护滑动序列池并动态形成相同长度组来减少重新对齐开销。

Result: 在SpecBench数据集上，使用Vicuna-7B/68M、Qwen3-8B/0.6B和GLM-4-9B/0.6B目标/草稿模型对，批量大小为8时相比批量大小1实现了最高3倍的吞吐量提升，同时保持95%的输出等价性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需定制内核即可与现有推理栈集成，在保持输出等价性的同时有效提升了批量推测解码的吞吐量。

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

*Yifan Zhang,Lanser Contributors*

TL;DR: Lanser-CLI是一个CLI优先的编排层，通过固定和协调语言服务器协议(LSP)服务器，为编码代理和CI提供确定性、可重放的工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉API和错误定位编辑，而语言服务器能计算关于真实代码的已验证IDE级事实。作者认为语言服务器不仅提供结构信息，还提供可操作的过程奖励。

Method: 开发了Lanser-CLI，包含：1) 稳健的寻址方案和选择器DSL；2) 确定性分析包；3) 变异操作的安全信封；4) 基于语言服务器事实的过程奖励函数。

Result: 建立了在冻结快照下的确定性形式化，并确立了过程奖励的单调性属性，使其适用于过程监督和反事实分析。

Conclusion: 语言服务器为编码代理提供了机器验证的、逐步的信号，将代理的规划循环与程序现实对齐，Lanser-CLI是实现这一目标的有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

TL;DR: 提出了Infinity-Chat数据集，用于评估语言模型在开放性问题上的多样性，发现语言模型存在显著的人工蜂群效应，即模型内部和不同模型之间生成相似内容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成多样化、类人的创意内容方面存在困难，可能导致人类思维长期同质化，但目前缺乏可扩展的方法来评估语言模型输出的多样性。

Method: 引入Infinity-Chat数据集，包含26K个多样化的真实世界开放性问题，建立了第一个全面的开放性问题分类法，包含6个顶级类别和17个子类别，并进行了31,250个人类标注。

Result: 研究发现语言模型在开放生成中存在明显的人工蜂群效应：模型内部重复生成相似回答，不同模型之间产生惊人相似的输出。语言模型、奖励模型和语言模型评判者在处理引发不同个体偏好的模型生成时，与人类评分的校准度较差。

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat为系统研究真实世界开放性问题提供了首个大规模资源，揭示了减轻人工蜂群效应带来的长期AI安全风险的关键见解。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型在处理长复杂上下文时存在有效性问题，现有方法如RAG对分块、嵌入和检索策略敏感且需要大量预处理步骤。

Method: 提出轻量级数据增强策略TAG，通过在上下文或提示中添加标签/标签定义来增强LLM的长上下文处理能力。

Result: 在NoLima和NovelQA基准测试中，TAG方法在32K token上下文中性能提升达17%，在多跳复杂推理问题中提升2.9%。

Conclusion: TAG是一种简单有效的长上下文增强方法，无需改变文档结构即可显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生物医学、法律和教育等高风险领域的广泛应用引发了对输出事实准确性的担忧，现有评估方法在处理长文本时因复杂推理链、交织观点和累积信息而失效。

Method: 构建LongHalluQA中文长文本事实性数据集；开发基于辩论的多智能体验证系统MAD-Fact；引入事实重要性层次结构来捕捉长文本中不同主张的重要性差异。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验表明，更大的LLM通常保持更高的事实一致性，而国产模型在中文内容上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估和增强长文本LLM输出的事实可靠性提供了结构化框架，指导其在敏感领域的安全部署。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical
concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk
domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods
for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning
chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this,
we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,
multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We
construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop
MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact
importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form
texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain
higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our
work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual
reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in
sensitive domains.

TL;DR: 使用基于句子嵌入的定制LLM来客观评估教学质量，在数据高效训练下达到人类水平甚至超人类表现，并与教师增值指标相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育领域需要客观可扩展的教学质量测量方法，通用大语言模型在处理复杂课堂观察工具时表现不佳。

Method: 采用基于句子级嵌入的定制LLM架构，系统评估五种不同句子嵌入，使用防过拟合的数据高效训练方案。

Result: 专业模型与专家评分相关性超过0.65，超越人类评分者平均相关性；高级模型更多关注课程级特征而非孤立话语；聚合模型分数与教师增值指标相关。

Conclusion: 建立了一种可行且强大的AI驱动教学测量新方法，为教师发展提供可扩展、可靠且有效的反馈路径。

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

Motivation: 研究不同架构大语言模型在上下文学习中的内部工作机制，特别是transformer、状态空间和混合模型在知识型任务中的表现差异。

Method: 结合行为探测和干预方法，分析不同架构LLM在知识型上下文学习任务中的内部机制。

Result: 发现上下文学习的功能向量主要位于自注意力和Mamba层，Mamba2可能使用不同于功能向量的机制进行上下文学习。功能向量对参数知识检索更重要，但对上下文知识理解不重要。

Conclusion: 不同架构LLM在上下文学习中可能有不同的内部机制，需要结合行为和机制分析来全面理解LLM能力。

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both
behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

TL;DR: TIR-Judge是一个端到端的强化学习框架，用于训练集成代码执行器的LLM评估器，通过工具增强推理提升评估准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估器仅基于文本推理，难以验证复杂约束或进行精确计算，需要工具增强来提升评估能力。

Method: 基于三个原则构建：跨可验证和不可验证领域的多样化训练、灵活的判断格式（点对点、成对、列表）、无需蒸馏的迭代强化学习。

Result: 在7个公共基准测试中，TIR-Judge比强推理基准提升6.4%（点对点）和7.7%（成对），列表性能与Claude-Opus-4相当但参数量仅8B。TIR-Judge-Zero无需蒸馏轨迹即可达到蒸馏变体性能。

Conclusion: 工具增强的评估器可以通过迭代强化学习自我进化，无需依赖蒸馏数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

TL;DR: QTT-RAG通过评估翻译质量（语义等价性、语法准确性、自然流畅性）并附加质量分数作为元数据，在多语言检索增强生成中提升低资源语言的表现，优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有mRAG方法在低资源语言场景中依赖翻译英文文档，但翻译质量差会降低生成性能，而改写方法又会导致事实扭曲和幻觉问题。

Method: 提出QTT-RAG方法，显式评估翻译质量三个维度（语义等价性、语法准确性、自然流畅性），将质量分数作为元数据附加而不改变原始内容。

Result: 在两个开放域QA基准（XORQA、MKQA）上使用6个指令调优LLM（2.4B-14B参数）评估，涵盖韩语、芬兰语（低资源）和中文（高资源），QTT-RAG在保持事实完整性的同时优于基线方法。

Conclusion: QTT-RAG通过在低资源设置中有效利用跨语言文档，为生成模型基于翻译可靠性做出明智决策提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

### [294] [Leveraging Hierarchical Organization for Medical Multi-document Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23104)
*Yi-Li Hsu,Katelyn X. Mei,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究在医学多文档摘要中引入层次结构是否能改善模型组织信息的能力。通过三种大语言模型和综合评估，发现层次方法能保持事实性、覆盖率和连贯性，同时提高人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学多文档摘要需要有效管理跨文档关系，传统平面摘要方法在组织信息方面存在局限，因此研究层次结构是否能改善模型的信息组织和上下文理解能力。

Method: 使用三种大语言模型，研究两种层次组织方式，通过自动指标、基于模型的指标和领域专家评估（偏好、可理解性、清晰度、复杂性、相关性、覆盖率、事实性、连贯性）进行综合评估。

Result: 人类专家更偏好模型生成的摘要而非人工编写的摘要。层次方法能保持信息的事实性、覆盖率和连贯性，同时提高人类偏好。GPT-4模拟判断与人类判断在更客观的评估维度上具有更高一致性。

Conclusion: 层次结构可以改善模型生成的医学摘要的清晰度，同时保持内容覆盖率，为提高生成摘要的人类偏好提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种紧凑的单模型多语言词形变化方法，在73种语言上联合训练，性能优于单语言基线，简化了部署需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏开源、通用、多语言形态变化系统的问题，特别是能够处理未见词汇的系统，包括捷克语等广泛语言。

Method: 使用单模型在73种语言数据上联合训练，引入频率加权、词干不相交的训练-开发-测试重采样程序，确保现实的数据分割。

Result: 模型轻量、对未见词汇鲁棒，在大多数语言中优于单语言基线，证明了多语言建模在词形变化中的有效性。

Conclusion: 多语言词形变化模型具有实际优势，简化了部署过程，无需管理和重新训练数十个单独的单语言模型。

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

*Shiwei Li,Xiandi Luo,Haozhao Wang,Xing Tang,Ziqiang Cui,Dugang Liu,Yuhua Li,Xiuqiang He,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TopLoRA方法，通过动态调整LoRA权重来学习token级别的输入-输出投影，解决了标准LoRA无法捕捉token特定信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA中所有输入token共享相同的权重，限制了其捕捉token特定信息的能力，因为不同token在语义上存在固有差异。

Method: TopLoRA将LoRA权重表示为BΣ_XA，其中A和B是低秩矩阵，Σ_X是根据每个输入token生成的对角矩阵，从而动态调整LoRA权重。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，TopLoRA始终优于LoRA及其变体。

Conclusion: TopLoRA在不增加LoRA权重秩的情况下，通过学习token级别的LoRA权重实现了更细粒度的适应，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at
https://github.com/Leopold1423/toplora-neurips25.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在形态屈折任务中引入语料库频率信息的方法，包括频率加权的训练-开发-测试集划分、结合类型准确率和标记准确率的评估方法，以及频率感知训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形态屈折方法缺乏对词频分布的考虑，而实际应用中用户输入会反映自然文本中的真实频率分布，因此需要将频率信息融入系统开发过程。

Method: 提出三方面改进：(1) 结合词干不相交和频率加权的数据集划分；(2) 在标准类型准确率基础上增加标记准确率评估；(3) 引入频率感知训练方法，在采样过程中显式考虑词频。

Result: 频率感知训练在43种语言中的26种语言上优于均匀采样方法，证明了频率信息对提升形态屈折性能的有效性。

Conclusion: 将语料库频率信息融入形态屈折任务能更好地反映真实应用场景，频率感知训练是提升模型性能的有效策略。

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ENTP框架通过符号化净化和神经重建来提升低质量SFT数据的价值，仅使用低质量数据构建的数据集在多个指令跟随基准测试中超越了13个现有数据选择方法和完整原始数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法通常丢弃低质量数据，但这些数据中可能包含有价值的信息，且质量过滤器往往不完美。

Method: 提出ENTP框架，包含符号模块（基于统计先验识别和修剪噪声样本）和神经组件（利用潜在表示和模型知识合成丰富的指令-响应对）。

Result: 仅使用低质量数据构建的ENTP增强数据集在五个指令跟随基准测试中超越了13个现有数据选择方法，甚至优于在完整原始数据集（约30万样本）上的微调结果。

Conclusion: 低质量数据具有未开发的潜力，智能净化和合成对于高效的指令对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了双阶段精炼框架，将剧本创作分解为创意叙事生成和格式转换两个独立阶段，通过混合数据合成解决训练数据稀缺问题，显著提升了LLM生成专业剧本的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端的LLM剧本生成方法难以同时掌握创意叙事构建和严格格式遵循两种不同能力，导致生成的剧本缺乏深层结构完整性和故事实质。

Method: 双阶段精炼框架：第一阶段将简要大纲转换为丰富的类小说散文，第二阶段将叙事精炼为专业格式的剧本。采用混合数据合成方法，包括反向合成（将现有剧本解构为结构化输入）和前向合成（基于输入生成高质量叙事文本）。

Result: 专业编剧的盲评显示，DSR相对于Gemini-2.5-Pro等强基线达到75%的胜率，达到人类水平表现的82.7%。

Conclusion: 分解生成架构结合定制化数据合成能够有效专业化LLM在复杂创意领域的应用。

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

TL;DR: MATCH是一种新的无参考代码评估指标，使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的嵌入表示，通过相似性评分反映生成代码实现任务的程度，比现有指标在功能正确性和人类偏好方面有更强的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代码生成日益普及，但准确评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配度仍面临挑战。传统评估方法如单元测试难以扩展且成本高，语法相似性指标无法捕捉代码功能，而CodeBERTScore等指标需要参考代码。

Method: 使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的有意义嵌入表示，通过相似性评分来评估生成代码实现任务的程度。

Result: MATCH在多种编程语言中，与功能正确性和人类偏好的相关性均强于现有指标。

Conclusion: MATCH提供了一种有效的无参考代码评估方法，能够更好地评估AI生成代码与开发者意图的匹配度。

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

*Shuai Huang,Wenxuan Zhao,Jun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SI-Bench是一个评估大语言模型社交智能的新基准，包含2,221个真实多轮对话，实验显示SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的过程推理上超越人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类，且思维链推理可能降低模型在社交对话任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展出拟人化能力，它们越来越多地被部署为自主代理与人类互动，但在真实复杂社交互动中评估其性能仍面临挑战，现有研究通过模拟代理间交互构建数据集，无法捕捉真实人类对话的语言风格和关系动态。

Method: 基于广泛的社会科学理论，从社交网络应用收集2,221个真实多轮对话构建SI-Bench基准，并对312个对话在8个主要模型上进行手动标注。

Result: SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的过程推理上超越了人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类，引入思维链推理可能降低LLMs在社交对话任务中的性能。

Conclusion: SI-Bench为评估LLMs的社交智能提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在社交对话中的优势与不足，所有数据集已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are
increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.
However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social
interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built
datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture
the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad
social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues
collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of
312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show
that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under
complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.
Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the
performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available
at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物关系抽取对识别药物相互作用和预测副作用至关重要，但目前缺乏专门的数据集，需要采用迁移学习。

Method: 先使用训练好的关系抽取模型发现实体间关系，然后应用于医学文本语料库构建药物关系本体，最后用大语言模型验证抽取的关系。

Result: 定量结果显示LLM对PubMed摘要子集中71%的抽取关系表示同意；定性分析表明该方法能揭示医学领域中的歧义性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效构建药物关系本体，同时揭示了医学领域关系抽取面临的挑战。

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug
drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine
learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large
medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations
compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自动化放射学报告生成中存在严重的临床幻觉风险，现有检测方法缺乏句子级粒度且泛化能力不足，需要开发更有效的验证技术。

Method: 采用句子级别的过程奖励模型（PRM），基于临床上下文和前置文本预测生成句子的正确性，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上使用弱监督标签进行微调。

Result: 轻量级0.5B参数PRM在多个指标上优于现有方法，在未见过的LVLM上表现出强泛化能力，能有效过滤低质量报告并提升临床指标。

Conclusion: 轻量级、上下文感知的PRM为临床LVLM提供了模型无关的安全层，无需访问内部激活即可有效检测和缓解幻觉问题。

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

Motivation: 传统语音识别研究主要关注标准语，而方言ASR被视为微调任务。本文旨在研究方言变异对ASR的影响，特别是在低资源语言环境下。

Method: 开发了78小时的孟加拉语STT语料库Ben-10，从语言学和数据驱动角度分析，比较了零样本和微调设置下语音基础模型的表现。

Result: 语音基础模型在方言ASR中表现严重不佳，所有深度学习方法都难以建模方言变异下的语音数据，但方言特定训练能缓解问题。

Conclusion: 方言变异对ASR构成重大挑战，Ben-10数据集可作为ASR算法在受限资源下的分布外测试资源，方言特定训练是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our
dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling
under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed
for this project are publicly available

Motivation: 解决现有阿拉伯语模型依赖英语翻译数据导致意图检测和检索增强生成失败的问题，确保文化真实性和准确性，同时解决事实正确但无法满足用户核心需求的"效用差距危机"。

Method: 使用专有阿拉伯OCR引擎数字化历史手稿扩展训练数据，结合深度语言工程框架训练，采用实用闭合架构，整合语言学、法学、圣训和古兰经注释等学术著作以及数千篇学术论文。

Result: 模型能够精确理解古典文本、当代写作和地区方言，掌握阿拉伯语的含义和优雅表达，在文化保存和通用知识领域均表现稳健。

Conclusion: Mubeen从信息存储库转变为决定性指南，与沙特2030愿景保持一致，通过原生阿拉伯语源和实用闭合架构解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the
meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across
classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on
comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant
responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that
often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen
uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its
core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the
"Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'
core needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By
prioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an
information repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.
The model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with
multi-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both
cultural preservation and general knowledge domains.

Motivation: LLM在传统编程任务中表现出色，但在视觉导向的编码任务中美学质量较差，需要提升代码的美观性。

Method: 1) 构建AesCode-358K指令调优数据集；2) 提出多智能体奖励反馈系统评估可执行性、静态美学和交互美学；3) 开发GRPO-AR算法联合优化功能性和代码美学；4) 建立OpenDesign基准测试。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM生成代码的美学质量，证明了多智能体奖励反馈和联合优化策略的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 第九届CHiME挑战赛引入多模态上下文感知识别任务，通过音频、视觉和上下文线索解决单房间环境中的鸡尾酒会问题，要求系统识别谁在何时说了什么以及与谁对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然多参与者对话中极端语音重叠（高达100%）和高度碎片化对话轮次的识别问题，传统音频方法在重叠语音场景下效果不佳。

Method: 使用多模态方法结合音频和视觉线索，收集非脚本化的自然群组对话数据，开发基线系统进行说话人识别和对话聚类。

Result: 纯音频基线系统的词错误率超过100%，而加入视觉线索后性能提升了50%，证明了多模态方法的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于解决极端语音重叠场景下的对话识别问题至关重要，视觉线索能显著提升系统性能。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields
substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In
this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data
collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

*Yuanzhen Xie,Liu Ye,Jiqun Chu,Mochi Gao,Hehuan Liu,Yunzhi Tan,Bo Hu,Zang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全自动化的数据为中心的方法来改进文本到SQL任务，包括自适应数据修复和错误数据增强，以及多模型协作训练和集成策略，在轻量级模型中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于代理的框架在文本到SQL任务中取得了显著改进，但数据为中心策略的影响很少被探索。现有方法主要依赖单个微调模型，其能力非常有限。

Method: 设计了全自动数据为中心流水线：自适应数据修复自动发现和修复训练数据集中的错误；错误数据增强扩散和增强初始模型预测的错误数据；多模型协作训练用不同增强数据训练多个模型；集成策略整合多个模型能力解决多选题。

Result: 实验结果表明数据为中心流水线和多模型交互迭代策略的有效性，在轻量级文本到SQL模型（70B以内）中取得了第一名。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的方法和多模型协作策略显著提升了文本到SQL任务的性能，证明了数据质量和模型多样性对任务成功的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of
ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this
field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has
rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated
data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data
repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset;
and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance
erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose
a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models
with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities
and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the
capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we
utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models
to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of
text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated
the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive
iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models
(within 70B).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文创建了阿拉伯语儿童语音数据集Arabic Little STT，并评估了Whisper模型在该数据集上的表现，发现即使最佳模型在儿童语音上的词错误率也显著高于成人语音，凸显了儿童语音基准测试和包容性训练数据的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语等低资源语言中儿童特定语音语料库缺失的问题，填补儿童语音数据稀缺的空白。

Method: 创建了包含355个来自288名儿童（6-13岁）的黎凡特阿拉伯语课堂录音的数据集Arabic Little STT，并系统评估了八个Whisper变体在该数据集上的表现。

Result: 即使是表现最佳的Whisper Large_v3模型在儿童语音上的词错误率也达到0.66，远高于在成人数据集上的低于0.20的词错误率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在ASR开发中专门儿童语音基准测试和包容性训练数据的必要性，同时必须遵循严格的伦理和隐私框架来保护儿童敏感信息。

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

TL;DR: AdaSearch是一种新颖的块状搜索策略，通过自适应分配计算预算，专注于关键初始令牌，在LLM对齐任务中显著优于Best-of-N和微调基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对齐仍是一个关键挑战，推理时方法提供了微调的灵活替代方案，但其均匀的计算努力往往产生次优对齐效果。假设在许多对齐任务中，响应的初始令牌更为关键。

Method: 引入AdaSearch块状搜索策略，使用采样计划自适应分配固定计算预算，专注于关键令牌。应用于顺序解码并引入其树搜索对应物AdaBeam。

Result: 在八个LLM上的综合评估显示，AdaSearch优于强大的Best-of-N和微调基线。无害生成、受控情感生成和数学推理任务的胜率相对于Best-of-N提高了10%以上。

Conclusion: AdaSearch通过专注于关键初始令牌的自适应计算预算分配，在LLM对齐任务中实现了显著改进。

Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a
flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort
often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment
tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical.
To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search
strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling
schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch
to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch
outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates
improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment
generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于八字命理的人物推理问答数据集和BaZi-LLM系统，通过符号推理与大语言模型结合生成动态细粒度虚拟角色，相比主流LLM准确率提升30.3%-62.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟角色生成方法依赖标注数据或手工设定，难以扩展且缺乏真实性和上下文连贯性，需要更有效的文化基础人物建模方法。

Method: 创建八字命理人物推理问答数据集，提出BaZi-LLM系统，将符号推理与大语言模型集成，生成时间动态和细粒度的虚拟角色。

Result: 相比DeepSeek-v3和GPT-5-mini等主流LLM，准确率提升30.3%-62.6%；当使用错误八字信息时，模型准确率下降20%-45%。

Conclusion: 基于文化基础的符号-LLM集成在真实角色模拟方面具有潜力，能够生成更真实、连贯的虚拟人物。

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and
virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or
handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate
realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for
BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into
wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as
life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM
system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to
generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with
mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a
30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information
is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of
culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character
simulation.

*Teng Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightKGG是一个使用小型语言模型从文本数据中高效提取知识图谱的新框架，通过上下文集成图提取和拓扑增强关系推理两个关键技术，在低资源环境下实现准确的知识图谱构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量知识图谱的稀缺性限制了AI应用的发展，现有提取方法要么依赖容易出错的模式匹配技术，要么需要资源密集型的大型语言模型，计算需求限制了在低资源环境中的可访问性。

Method: 提出两个关键技术：(1)上下文集成图提取：将上下文信息与节点和边集成到统一图结构中；(2)拓扑增强关系推理：利用提取图的固有拓扑结构高效推断关系，无需依赖LLM的复杂语言理解能力。

Result: 该框架能够在最小硬件需求下实现准确的知识图谱构建，弥合了自动化知识提取与实际部署场景之间的差距。

Conclusion: LightKGG通过优化小型语言模型在结构化NLP任务中的效率，为低资源环境下的知识图谱提取提供了科学严谨的方法，提高了知识提取的可访问性和实用性。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估大语言模型预测AI对就业影响的基准，结合了美国部门级职位发布数据和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据，评估了不同提示策略在劳动力预测中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能正在重塑劳动力市场，但缺乏系统预测AI对就业影响的工具。现有研究显示LLMs能够提取情感、总结经济报告和模拟预测者行为，但很少评估其在前瞻性劳动力预测中的应用。

Method: 结合两个互补数据集：美国部门级高频职位发布指数和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据，构建具有清晰时间分割的预测任务。评估多种提示策略，包括任务支架式、角色驱动式和混合方法。

Result: 结构化任务提示持续提高预测稳定性，角色提示在短期趋势上具有优势。但性能在不同部门和预测时间范围内差异显著，需要领域感知提示和严格评估协议。

Conclusion: 该基准支持未来关于劳动力预测、提示设计和基于LLM的经济推理研究，为研究AI作为劳动力市场预测工具的局限性和机会提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to
systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a
benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate
changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing
research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,
and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for
forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary
datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United
States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI
adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal
splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using
multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and
hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy
and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task
prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer
advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly
across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting
and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to
support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based
economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how
LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible
testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool
in the context of labor markets.

TL;DR: 本文研究了宗教语言在气候相关文本中的表现形式，比较了基于规则的方法和大型语言模型在检测宗教语言方面的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宗教语言在当代话语中持续存在，甚至在环境行动主义和气候变化辩论等世俗领域也是如此。本文旨在调查宗教语言在世俗和宗教非政府组织产生的气候相关文本中的显性和隐性表现形式。

Method: 采用双重方法：基于生态神学文献构建宗教术语层次树的规则模型，以及在零样本设置下运行的大型语言模型。使用包含88万多句子的数据集进行比较分析。

Result: 结果显示，基于规则的方法比大型语言模型更一致地将句子标记为宗教语言。这些发现凸显了计算检测宗教语言的方法学挑战。

Conclusion: 本研究通过展示分析神圣在气候话语中持续存在的方法的潜力和局限性，为宗教研究中的数字方法做出了贡献。

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合专家(MoE)框架的时间序列预测模型，整合了xLSTM、增强线性模型、PatchTST和minGRU等多种SOTA模型，通过Transformer-based MoE门控网络实现，在标准基准测试中超越了所有现有TSF模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测领域存在模型有效性争议，近期研究表明Transformer模型可能不如简单线性模型，而LLM模型的有效性也受到质疑。TSF数据具有近期偏好和不可预测事件的特点，需要更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合专家框架，整合多种互补的SOTA模型(xLSTM、增强线性模型、PatchTST、minGRU等)，通过基于Transformer的MoE门控网络进行集成。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，提出的MoE框架模型超越了所有现有的时间序列预测模型，包括最新的基于MoE框架的方法。

Conclusion: 混合专家框架能够有效整合多种互补的时间序列预测模型，通过门控网络实现最优性能，为TSF领域提供了新的SOTA解决方案。

Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries
Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM
demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced
Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former
based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出了Omni-Reward，一个支持自由形式偏好的通用多模态奖励模型，解决了模态不平衡和偏好刚性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型面临两个基本挑战：模态不平衡（主要关注文本和图像，对其他模态支持有限）和偏好刚性（固定二元偏好对无法捕捉个性化偏好的复杂性）。

Method: 包含三个部分：Omni-RewardBench（首个多模态奖励模型基准）、Omni-RewardData（包含248K通用偏好对和69K指令调优对的多模态数据集）、Omni-RewardModel（判别式和生成式奖励模型）。

Result: 在Omni-RewardBench和其他广泛使用的奖励建模基准上取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: Omni-Reward是朝着通用多模态奖励建模迈出的重要一步，支持自由形式偏好，覆盖文本、图像、视频、音频和3D五种模态。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单轮场景中的置信度，而在复杂多轮交互中LLM置信度的研究有限，需要探索LLM搜索代理在长序列动作后表达置信度的能力。

Method: 在开源代理模型上进行实验，发现高置信度时任务准确率更高，低置信度时准确率接近零。基于此提出测试时缩放方法，使用置信度分数判断答案质量，鼓励模型达到满意置信度水平时重试。

Result: 实验结果显示，模型在高置信度时任务准确率显著更高，低置信度时准确率接近零。提出的方法显著减少了token消耗，与基线固定预算方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: LLM搜索代理能够在多轮交互中有效表达置信度，基于置信度的测试时缩放方法能够平衡性能和效率，为LLM不确定性评估提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer
reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while
research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this
paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to
communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after
long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to
outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source
agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at
high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based
on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use
confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again
until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed
methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive
performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

TL;DR: 构建了一个针对债务、每股收益和销售额三个核心财务指标的句子级立场检测语料库，使用ChatGPT-o3-pro模型标注并在严格人工验证下完成。通过系统评估现代大语言模型在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的表现，发现少样本结合思维链提示效果最佳，且LLMs在SEC和ECT数据集上的表现存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEC申报文件和季度财报电话会议记录中的金融叙述对投资者、审计师和监管者非常重要，但其长度、金融术语和细微语言使得细粒度分析困难。先前的情感分析需要大量昂贵的标注数据，使得针对特定财务目标的句子级立场检测具有挑战性。

Method: 从Form 10-K年报和ECTs中提取句子，使用ChatGPT-o3-pro模型标注立场（积极、消极、中性）并进行严格人工验证。构建语料库后，系统评估现代LLMs在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的表现。

Result: 少样本结合思维链提示策略表现最佳，优于监督基线方法。不同LLMs在SEC和ECT数据集上的表现存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在不需大量标注数据的情况下，利用LLMs进行金融领域特定目标的立场检测具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准大多忽视了数学辅导所需的诊断学生困难和逐步引导的能力，而这是有效数学辅导的关键。

Method: 构建包含685个问题的基准，每个问题配有特定评分标准，分为三个任务：洞察发现、操作制定和操作执行，并评估了12个领先的MLLM。

Result: 发现专有系统和开源系统之间存在明显性能差距，与人类导师相比仍有很大提升空间，OCR流程会降低辅导质量，少样本提示效果有限，基于评分标准的LLM评判方法可靠性高。

Conclusion: MMTutorBench既展示了AI数学辅导的难度，也证明了其诊断价值，有助于推进AI辅导技术的发展。

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

Conclusion: M4FC数据集解决了现有数据集的局限性，提供了更大规模、更多语言和任务多样性的多模态事实核查资源，通过分析中间任务对下游裁决预测的影响，为多模态事实核查研究提供了新的基准。

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make
our dataset and code available.

### [321] [IPQA: A Benchmark for Core Intent Identification in Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23536)
*Jieyong Kim,Maryam Amirizaniani,Soojin Yoon,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了IPQA基准，用于评估个性化问答中的核心意图识别能力，发现当前语言模型在识别用户优先考虑的核心意图方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅评估回答质量或检索性能，未直接衡量意图识别能力，而理解用户优先考虑的核心意图对于生成满足个性化信息需求的回答至关重要。

Method: 基于满意理论，从用户答案选择行为中推导核心意图，通过系统过滤、基于LLM的标注以及结合自动验证和人工验证的严格质量控制构建多领域数据集。

Result: 实验评估显示，当前最先进的语言模型在个性化情境下难以识别核心意图，模型无法从用户历史中识别核心意图，且随着问题复杂度增加性能下降。

Conclusion: 需要改进模型在个性化问答中的核心意图识别能力，IPQA基准和数据集将公开以促进该方向的研究。

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

*Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Siyue Zhang,Chen Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIMRANK是一个使用少量高质量合成数据进行微调的LLM重排序器，在推理密集型和指令跟随检索任务中表现出色，仅需传统方法5%的数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模微调来适应信息重排序任务，计算成本高昂。本文旨在证明现代LLM可以通过最小化高质量监督有效适应重排序任务。

Method: 设计了LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER管道生成多样化、具有挑战性的合成重排序示例，并利用这些数据微调LIMRANK重排序模型。

Result: LIMRANK在BRIGHT和FollowIR基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，同时训练数据量仅为先前工作的不到5%。消融研究验证了LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER的有效性和LIMRANK在下游任务中的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过高质量合成数据可以有效训练LLM重排序器，显著减少数据需求，同时在推理密集型和指令跟随检索任务中保持竞争力，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

### [323] [Hope Speech Detection in Social Media English Corpora: Performance of Traditional and Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23585)
*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了传统机器学习模型和微调transformer在希望语音检测任务上的表现，发现transformer模型在精度和召回率方面表现更好，特别是在小数据集上检测希望的微妙语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别希望语音已成为重要的NLP任务，需要在社交媒体平台上检测具有动机性和目标导向行为的表达。

Method: 使用传统机器学习模型（SVM、逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯）和微调的transformer模型，在预分割的希望语音数据集上进行评估。

Result: 传统模型中线性核SVM和逻辑回归的macro-F1为0.78，RBF核SVM为0.77，朴素贝叶斯为0.75。最佳transformer模型获得加权精度0.82、加权召回率0.80、加权F1 0.79、macro F1 0.79和准确率0.80。

Conclusion: 虽然优化配置的传统机器学习模型仍然敏捷，但transformer架构能够检测希望的微妙语义，在希望语音检测中实现更高的精度和召回率，表明大型transformer和LLM在小数据集上可能表现更好。

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

*Yizhu Jiao,Jiaqi Zeng,Julien Veron Vialard,Oleksii Kuchaiev,Jiawei Han,Olivier Delalleau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BR-RM方法，将"三思而后行"原则引入奖励建模，通过两轮评估减少判断扩散，提高对细微错误的敏感性，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型将多个质量维度压缩为单一标量，导致注意力分散和判断扩散，无法进行深入分析。

Method: BR-RM采用两轮评估：第一轮自适应分支选择关键维度并生成假设，第二轮针对性地重新审视和验证这些假设。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的奖励建模基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BR-RM通过将一次性评分转换为聚焦的二次审视推理，有效减少判断扩散，提高对细微错误的敏感性，同时保持实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个综合性的多层面框架，将人工智能与计算心理学结合，通过端到端的开发流程构建了从预测建模到交互式心理分析的完整系统。


<details>

Motivation: 利用人工智能和计算心理学的融合，通过计算手段建模、理解和交互复杂的人类心理状态，弥合孤立预测建模与交互式心理分析系统之间的差距。

Method: 采用端到端开发流程：1）在四个多样化心理学数据集上建立基础性能基准；2）微调最先进的Transformer模型，解决回归任务中的数值不稳定性和资源限制下的训练挑战；3）使用参数高效技术微调生成式大语言模型作为交互式"人格大脑"；4）将所有模型构建为可扩展的微服务生态系统。

Conclusion: 该工作通过整合预测分析与生成对话的完整研究到部署流程，为计算心理学和人机交互的未来研究提供了实用模型，体现了其整体性方法的重要意义。

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

*Kentaro Ueda,Takehiro Takayanagi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PREFINE是一个无需参数更新或直接用户反馈的个性化故事生成框架，通过构建伪用户代理和用户特定评分标准来实现个性化生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在个性化文本生成方面依赖显式反馈或微调，存在用户负担、数据收集、计算成本和隐私等实际问题

Method: 构建伪用户代理和用户特定评分标准，让代理基于这些定制标准代表用户进行批判和优化

Result: 在PerDOC和PerMPST数据集上，PREFINE在自动评估中获得更高胜率和显著分数，且不损害一般故事质量

Conclusion: 伪用户代理和用户特定评分标准对提升个性化性能至关重要，该方法在对话系统、教育和推荐等更广泛应用中具有潜力

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SIGN（Schema-Induced Games for Naming）命名游戏，研究轻量级结构如何引导多智能体系统的约定形成，相比无约束自然语言通信，能实现更快收敛和高达5.8倍的更高一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实AI系统中，大型语言模型智能体之间的交互日益复杂，当这些智能体形成不一致的约定时，协调会崩溃。协作编码和分布式规划等应用需要可靠、一致的通信，且系统扩展时可扩展性是核心问题。

Method: 引入SIGN命名游戏，通过模式诱导的通信来引导约定形成，并与无约束自然语言通信进行比较。

Result: 模式诱导通信相比无约束自然语言能实现更快收敛，达成一致性高达5.8倍。

Conclusion: 最小化结构可以作为高效多智能体协调的简单控制机制，其应用范围可扩展到命名游戏之外的更广泛领域。

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在能力天花板，参数规模扩大至30B时知识检索任务准确率几乎没有提升，而数学任务准确率保持在19-20%不变，尽管损失函数持续下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统评估OPT和Pythia模型家族在不同规模下的能力表现，揭示知识密集型任务中的扩展瓶颈问题。

Method: 对70M-30B参数的OPT和Pythia模型进行系统评估，包括知识检索任务、MMLU数学基准测试，并进行注意力干预实验。

Result: 知识检索任务准确率随参数增加基本不变，数学任务准确率稳定在19-20%，而算术等程序性任务则显示传统扩展模式。注意力干预导致性能灾难性崩溃。

Conclusion: 对于使用OPT和Pythia架构的知识密集型应用，参数规模超过1-2B后准确率增益极小，尽管损失函数持续改善。这些发现为资源分配决策提供了量化依据。

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

TL;DR: 开发了GeoThoughts数据集和GeoThought-MLLM模型，通过链式思维训练提升几何推理能力，在几何任务中超越现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本数学推理中表现出色，但在视觉几何推理任务中性能显著下降，主要由于几何问题的内在复杂性和现有数据集的局限性。

Method: 构建包含6,243个样本的Geo-Thought-6K数据集和10,834个样本的Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K数据集，每个样本包含视觉描述、分步解决方案、显式推理链和反思步骤。基于此开发GeoThought-MLLM多模态模型。

Result: 模型在几何任务中超越现有基准，在领域内和领域外设置下均表现出改进的几何推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过链式思维训练可以显著提升几何推理能力，错误主要源于数学概念误解或空间判断错误，通过CoT纠正这些错误可以获得正确答案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型在组合优化问题中的应用潜力，特别是利用学习策略解决传统算法难以扩展的大规模问题。

Method: 使用轨迹平衡损失训练GFlowNets，顺序构建解决方案：为生成树选择边、为路径选择节点、为旅行选择城市。

Result: 在多种图配置的基准实例上，GFlowNets能够找到最优解，结果与经典算法（Dijkstra、Kruskal、TSP精确求解器）一致。训练收敛时间随问题复杂度增加而增长。

Conclusion: 生成模型可以通过学习策略解决组合优化问题，主要优势是计算可扩展性：GFlowNets通过训练分摊计算成本，有潜力扩展到经典精确方法不可行的大规模问题实例。

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性框架下强化学习的计算复杂性，证明了在该设置中学习$\epsilon$-最优策略是计算困难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性框架的计算复杂性，该框架假设策略集$\Pi$中所有策略的价值函数都是线性可实现的，比$q^{\pi}$-可实现性弱但比$q^*$-可实现性强，提供了函数逼近自然出现的实用模型。

Method: 通过从$\delta$-Max-3SAT和$\delta$-Max-3SAT(b)问题归约到GLinear-$\kappa$-RL（贪心策略）和SLinear-$\kappa$-RL（softmax策略）实例，建立计算复杂性结果。

Result: 证明了在该设置下学习$\epsilon$-最优策略是NP困难的，对于贪心策略集建立了NP困难性，对于softmax策略集在随机指数时间假设下证明了指数下界。

Conclusion: 计算困难性在部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性中持续存在，即使将$\Pi$扩展到最优策略之外，与生成访问模型下的$q^{\pi}$-可实现性相比，通常无法获得积极的计算结果。

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用小型开源模型作为资源高效替代方案，通过优化10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型进行多语言电商意图识别，实现了与GPT-4.1相当的99%准确率，同时显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用大型语言模型在专业任务部署中存在高计算成本、延迟和运营费用的问题，需要寻找资源效率更高的替代方案。

Method: 使用量化低秩适应(QLoRA)在合成数据集上微调10亿参数Llama 3.2模型，然后应用后训练量化技术创建GPU优化(GPTQ)和CPU优化(GGUF)版本。

Result: 专用1B模型达到99%准确率，匹配GPT-4.1性能。GPTQ减少41%显存但推理速度下降82%，GGUF在CPU上实现18倍推理吞吐量提升和90%以上内存消耗减少。

Conclusion: 经过适当优化的小型开源模型不仅是可行的，而且是领域特定应用的更合适替代方案，能以极低计算成本提供最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

### [333] [Distribution Shift Alignment Helps LLMs Simulate Survey Response Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21977)
*Ji Huang,Mengfei Li,Shuai Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA)的两阶段微调方法，用于改进使用大语言模型模拟人类调查响应的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法存在提示敏感性和低准确性问题，而传统微调方法主要拟合训练集分布，无法产生比训练集更准确的结果，这与使用LLM模拟调查响应的初衷相悖。

Method: DSA是一种两阶段微调方法，通过对齐输出分布和不同背景下的分布变化来学习分布如何变化，而不是拟合训练数据。

Result: 在五个公开调查数据集上，DSA始终优于其他方法，能够将所需真实数据减少53.48-69.12%，在准确性、鲁棒性和数据节省方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DSA方法能够提供比训练数据更接近真实分布的结果，证明了其在调查模拟中的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

*Yangqin Jiang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LightAgent是一个移动GUI代理基础模型解决方案，通过设备-云协作平衡本地模型成本效益和云端模型高性能，解决移动设备上小模型能力不足而大模型部署困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动GUI代理面临关键困境：真正在设备上的小模型（4B或更小）性能不足，而能力强的模型（从7B开始）要么太大无法在移动设备部署，要么成本过高（如仅限云端的闭源MLLMs）。

Method: 通过两阶段SFT->GRPO训练增强Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型在合成GUI数据上的决策能力；集成高效长推理机制在有限资源下利用历史交互；默认在设备上执行，仅通过实时复杂度评估将挑战性子任务升级到云端。

Result: 在AndroidLab基准测试和多样化应用上的实验表明，LightAgent匹配或接近更大模型的性能，同时显著降低云成本。

Conclusion: LightAgent通过设备-云协作有效解决了移动GUI代理的部署困境，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低成本。

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型能有效识别模式和推理，但其准确性不稳定，阻碍了在高风险决策应用中的采用。本文从风险投资角度研究这一问题，基于创始人特征预测初创企业成功。

Method: 引入LLM-AR管道，通过迭代策略进化循环结合关联规则挖掘，逐步优化预测规则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

Motivation: 传统元强化学习虽然能获得接近贝叶斯最优的策略，但往往无法学习到紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态，这种表示效率低下可能限制智能体的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 受神经科学中预测编码和深度强化学习中辅助预测目标的启发，将自监督预测编码模块集成到元强化学习中。

Conclusion: 预测学习作为在部分可观测环境中导航的智能体进行有效表示学习的指导原则具有重要作用。

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

Motivation: 研究系统级硬件/软件协同设计方法在中等复杂度设计中的应用价值，探索早期架构洞察、快速验证和成本/性能权衡。

Method: 使用SpecC方法学对PCM-to-PWM转换器进行建模和探索，通过系统级估计和快速功能仿真评估不同的硬件/软件分区方案。

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level

methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

TL;DR: 论文主张将智能重新定义为构建和修正解释的能力，提出计算解释和能量结构化因果模型(ESCMs)，使机器学习模型具有可干预的因果结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习追求预测准确性，但缺乏因果透明度，无法对特定机制进行外科手术式编辑。需要建立具有可干预因果语义的内部表示。

Method: 引入计算解释和能量结构化因果模型(ESCMs)，将机制表达为约束而非显式输入输出映射，通过局部手术实现干预。

Result: ESCMs在温和条件下恢复标准SCM语义，提供形式化语言支持因果推理，使系统能够理解而不仅仅是预测。

Conclusion: 智能应定义为在批评下构建解释的能力，ESCMs为实现可干预的因果推理提供了理论基础和实现框架。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型存在能耗高（GPT-4训练需50-60GWh）、易产生幻觉、无法应用于关键领域等问题，而人脑仅消耗20W功率，需要更高效智能的AI系统。

Method: 提出发展轻量级领域特定多模态模型，这些模型能够在动态环境中进行推理、规划和决策，利用实时数据和先验知识，并具备持续学习和进化能力。

Result: 描绘了未来AI系统的蓝图：从当前大型模型转向能效高、能处理不确定性的智能体，需要硬件能效实现1000倍以上的突破。

Conclusion: 下一代AI将实现从数据驱动的大型模型向能效高、具备推理能力的领域特定智能体的转变，这需要硬件和算法的协同创新。

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Motivation: 脑机接口面临信息传输率低和用户特定校准等限制，虽然最近研究探索了大型语言模型的集成，但部署智能AI仍面临技术障碍和伦理担忧，需要对该新兴方向进行全面讨论。

Method: 这是一篇立场论文，通过论证方式提出从BCI到BAC的范式扩展，强调重新定义智能体为主动协作伙伴，并建立相应的伦理和协作框架。

Result: 提出了脑-智能体协作(BAC)的新范式概念，强调智能体应作为主动协作伙伴，而非被动数据处理工具。

Conclusion: 脑机接口领域需要向脑-智能体协作范式扩展，通过关注伦理数据管理、模型可靠性和人-智能体协作框架，确保这些系统安全、可信且有效。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require
emotional judgment and ethical consideration. Prior work often reuses human
trait inventories (Big Five, \hexaco) or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral
realism and domain relevance. We propose a framework that (1) uses situational
judgment tests (SJTs) from realistic scenarios to probe domain-specific
competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality
psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000
SJTs, and 300,000 responses. We will release the dataset and all code to the

TL;DR: 提出一种基于神经强化学习的无导数优化器Dopamine，通过权重扰动学习解决信用分配问题，比反向传播更高效且神经生物学更合理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络中的信用分配问题，传统梯度方法如反向传播存在计算效率低、内存消耗大、权重传输和更新锁定等问题，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用权重扰动学习，通过最小化期望结果与真实结果之间的奖励预测误差来调整学习率，实现自适应学习率策略，模仿大脑中多巴胺的作用机制。

Result: 在XOR任务和混沌时间序列预测任务中，Dopamine优化器训练的网络收敛更快，性能优于标准权重扰动方法，与梯度算法相当，但计算和内存消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: Dopamine优化器不仅找到了稳健解，性能与最先进的机器学习优化器相当，而且神经生物学上更合理，为高效神经网络训练提供了新途径。

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

TL;DR: OptiTree是一种新颖的树搜索方法，通过自适应问题分解为更简单的子问题来增强复杂问题的建模能力，在优化建模任务中相比现有方法提升超过10%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化建模是运筹学中最关键但技术性最强的部分。现有方法使用大语言模型将任务分解为生成变量、约束和目标等步骤，但由于运筹学问题具有高度复杂的数学结构，标准固定步骤分解往往无法实现高性能。

Method: 开发了一个建模树，基于层次化问题分类和复杂度组织各种运筹学问题，每个节点代表一个问题类别并包含相关的高级建模思路。给定建模问题时，递归搜索树以识别一系列更简单的子问题，并通过自适应整合层次化思路来综合全局建模思路。

Conclusion: OptiTree通过树搜索和自适应问题分解的方法，有效解决了复杂运筹学问题的建模挑战，显著提升了建模性能。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at

TL;DR: 提出了PACR（渐进上升置信度奖励），一种密集的模型内在奖励，通过追踪模型对正确答案置信度的上升趋势来指导强化学习中的探索过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR的稀疏、基于结果的奖励无法为中间推理步骤提供指导，导致探索过程缓慢。需要一种密集的奖励信号来加速推理探索。

Method: PACR通过直接计算模型对正确答案置信度的变化趋势作为奖励，编码了"在良好推理轨迹上，正确答案概率应呈上升趋势"的归纳偏置。

Result: PACR加速了探索过程，用更少的轨迹达到奖励饱和，并在多个基准测试中取得了改进。

Conclusion: 密集的模型内在塑形信号可以使RLVR训练更有效和可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Abstract: Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) for Vietnamese music presents unique
challenges due to its tonal complexity and dialectal variations, but remains
largely unexplored due to the lack of a dedicated dataset. Therefore, we
curated the first large-scale Vietnamese ALT dataset (VietLyrics), comprising
647 hours of songs with line-level aligned lyrics and metadata to address these

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多级图粗化和细化框架来解决带时间窗的容量约束车辆路径问题，通过时空距离度量聚合客户节点，在减少计算时间的同时保持或改进解的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 带时间窗的容量约束车辆路径问题是物流中的基础NP难优化问题，大规模实例对精确求解器具有计算挑战性，需要开发高效的求解方法。

Method: 使用多级图粗化和细化框架，通过时空距离度量将客户聚合成元节点，在简化问题上应用经典启发式算法，然后扩展到原始空间并进行可行性修正。

Result: 在Solomon基准实例上的初步实验表明，该方法减少了计算时间，同时保持或改进了解的质量，特别是在容量和时间窗约束方面。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模车辆路径问题提供了有效的求解框架，并探索了量子启发优化技术的集成潜力，有望进一步加速大规模车辆路径任务。

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in logistics. Solving large-scale
instances remains computationally challenging for exact solvers. This work
introduces a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement framework that
aggregates customers into meta-nodes using a spatio-temporal distance metric.
The reduced problem is solved with classical heuristics and subsequently
expanded back into the original space with feasibility corrections. Preliminary
experiments on Solomon benchmark instances show that the proposed method
reduces computation time while preserving or improving solution quality,
particularly with respect to capacity and time window constraints. The paper
also explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques,
highlighting their potential to further accelerate large-scale vehicle routing
tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文献知识增强的LIFT LLM框架，用于卡车驾驶风险预测，该框架结合了LLM推理核心、文献处理流水线和结果评估器，在预测准确性和可解释性方面均优于基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决卡车驾驶风险预测中的准确性和可解释性问题，同时利用领域文献知识来增强模型的理解能力。

Method: 使用文献信息增强的微调LLM（LIFT LLM），包括LLM驱动的推理核心、文献处理流水线（从299篇领域论文构建知识库）和结果评估器。

Result: LIFT LLM在真实数据集上微调后，召回率比基准模型提高26.7%，F1分数提高10.1%；产生的变量重要性排序与基准模型一致，且在不同数据采样条件下保持稳健；通过PERMANOVA测试验证了识别的风险场景。

Conclusion: LIFT LLM框架在卡车驾驶风险预测中表现出色，证明了文献知识库和微调过程对模型可解释性的贡献，展示了在数据驱动知识发现方面的潜力。

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and
the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed
the potential of the LIFT LLM in data-driven knowledge discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DynaSolidGeo，这是第一个用于评估视觉语言模型在立体几何中真正空间推理能力的动态基准，包含503个专家策划的问题，可以动态生成无限多样的多模态实例，并加入了基于专家标注推理链的过程评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数多模态数学推理基准主要关注2D平面几何，依赖静态数据集容易受到数据污染和记忆的影响，并且仅通过最终答案评估模型，忽视了推理过程。

Method: 通过半自动标注流程构建DynaSolidGeo基准，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可以动态生成多样化的多模态文本-视觉实例，并引入基于专家标注推理链的过程评估。

Result: 实验显示代表性开源和闭源视觉语言模型之间存在较大性能差距，在动态设置下性能严重下降，在需要高水平空间智能的任务（如心理旋转和可视化）上表现较差。

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo填补了立体几何空间推理评估的空白，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在空间推理能力上的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在推理任务上表现有限，当问题复杂度超过一定程度时会急剧失败。虽然大型推理模型在现有基准测试中表现优异，但通过更复杂的深度推理数据集测试发现其泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估大型语言模型在复杂推理任务上的实际能力，揭示现有基准测试的局限性，并探索模型在真实世界复杂场景中的表现。

Method: 开发了深度推理数据集（DeepRD），包含可扩展复杂度的图连接性和自然语言证明规划问题，用于评估大型推理模型在不同复杂度下的表现。

Result: 大型推理模型在足够复杂度下性能急剧下降，无法有效泛化。虽然大多数真实世界案例落在模型成功范围内，但长尾分布暴露了显著的失败风险。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在短期内具有实用性，但需要开发能够超越训练分布复杂度的新方法来实现真正的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

Motivation: 理解大型推理模型（LRM）涌现的推理能力是一个困难的开放性问题，这对于改进训练和理解鲁棒性有重要应用价值。

Method: 采用无记忆有限状态机（FSM）来近似LRM的层次推理动态，识别了初始化、演绎、增强策略、不确定性估计、回溯和最终结论等离散推理状态，将推理轨迹表示为状态图中的转移序列。

Result: FSM分析揭示了不同模型在推理方法上的差异，显示了不同的推理模式和潜在缺陷。

Conclusion: 基于FSM的分析为评估和改进LLM推理提供了一个新的视角，能够系统地分析、解释和可视化不同模型处理问题的方式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可中断协作角色扮演者(ICR)算法，用于训练LLM驱动的协作代理，使其能够更好地接受干预并促进团队共识达成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地部署在代理环境中与人类协作，需要评估其在多轮、多方任务中的协作能力。标准RLHF训练的代理倾向于忽略干预，这使得提升团队共识变得困难。

Method: 使用改进动作MDP分析标准AI代理的次优行为，提出ICR算法训练共识最优的协作代理，使其能够智能收集合作伙伴干预提供的信息。

Result: 在多个协作任务环境中的实验表明，ICR平均能够更好地促进共识收敛，并探索更多样化的解决方案。

Conclusion: ICR算法能够有效解决标准AI代理忽略干预的问题，提升LLM代理在协作任务中的表现和共识达成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

TL;DR: OFFSIDE是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型在足球转会谣言上信息遗忘能力的新基准，包含15.68K条手动整理的数据，支持选择性遗忘、纠正性再学习和单模态遗忘等高级设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的发展，数据隐私问题日益突出，机器遗忘成为关键需求。现有MLLM遗忘基准存在图像多样性不足、准确性问题和评估场景不充分等局限性。

Method: 构建基于足球转会谣言的手动整理数据集，包含四个测试集来评估遗忘效果、泛化性、实用性和鲁棒性，支持选择性遗忘、纠正性再学习和单模态遗忘等设置。

Result: 评估发现：单模态方法在多模态谣言上失败；遗忘效果主要由灾难性遗忘驱动；所有方法都难以处理视觉谣言；遗忘的谣言容易被恢复；所有方法都易受提示攻击。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在显著漏洞，需要更鲁棒的多模态遗忘解决方案。OFFSIDE基准为MLLM遗忘研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

TL;DR: ATOM是一个自适应优化的方法，用于从非结构化文本构建和持续更新时序知识图谱，通过将文档拆分为原子事实来提高提取的完整性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱构建忽略了现实世界数据的动态性和时间敏感性，而现有的零样本或少样本方法在多次运行中存在不稳定性和关键事实覆盖不完整的问题。

Method: 将输入文档拆分为最小自包含的原子事实，构建原子时序知识图谱，采用双时间建模区分信息观察时间和有效时间，然后并行合并原子知识图谱。

Result: 相比基线方法，ATOM实现了约18%更高的完整性、约17%更好的稳定性，以及超过90%的延迟减少。

Conclusion: ATOM在动态时序知识图谱构建方面展现出强大的可扩展性潜力。

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析上下文学习性能的新框架，研究预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，如何通过适当构建的上下文来改善预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但理论上尚不清楚这种能力如何产生，特别是预训练过程和上下文构建等关键因素的确切作用。

Method: 构建了一个包含单层transformer的简单示例，然后扩展到更一般情况，推导了ICL性能、上下文长度以及预训练与查询任务分布之间KL散度的精确关系，并通过实验验证。

Result: 当预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，适当构建的上下文可以将输出分布向查询任务分布转移，以可量化的方式实现准确预测。

Conclusion: 提出了一个理论框架来分析ICL性能，揭示了上下文在弥合预训练和查询任务分布差距中的作用，并通过理论和实验验证了这种关系的可量化性质。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: CLIN-LLM是一个安全约束的混合管道系统，集成了多模态患者编码、不确定性校准的疾病分类和检索增强的治疗生成，在症状到疾病分类和治疗推荐方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的医疗系统缺乏医学基础且无法量化不确定性，导致输出不安全。需要开发一个能够提供安全、可靠医疗决策支持的系统。

Method: 使用BioBERT在1,200个临床案例上进行微调，结合Focal Loss和Monte Carlo Dropout实现置信度感知预测。采用Biomedical Sentence-BERT检索MedDialog语料库中的相关对话，通过微调的FLAN-T5模型生成个性化治疗建议，并使用RxNorm进行抗生素管理和药物相互作用筛查。

Result: CLIN-LLM达到98%的准确率和F1分数，比ClinicalBERT提升7.1%，检索精度为78%，临床医生评分为4.2/5分。不安全抗生素建议比GPT-5减少67%。

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM展示了强大的鲁棒性、可解释性和临床安全性，为资源有限的医疗环境提供了一个可部署的、人机协作的决策支持框架。

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的程序经常满足单元测试但在竞赛时间和内存预算下失败，需要超越正确性的效率保证。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，包括规划器提出算法草图、静态剪枝器过滤高风险计划、编码器生成C++代码、分析器进行性能分析、复杂度分析器评估复杂度类别并指导修复。

Result: 在26个问题上，SwiftSolve在第一次尝试达到61.54%通过率，三次尝试内达到80.77%解决率，运行级成功率为73.08%，相比Claude Opus 4显著提升。

Conclusion: 性能分析和复杂度指导的重新规划能有效减少低效率问题，同时保持准确性，证明了超越正确性的效率指标的重要性。

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出基于首个生成token对数概率来检测LLM样板回复的方法，可在单步生成后识别拒绝、问候等非实质性回答，实现计算成本优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常耗费大量计算资源生成样板回复（如拒绝、简单确认、问候等），增加了不必要的成本和延迟。

Method: 使用首个生成token的对数概率分布作为信号，通过轻量级k-NN分类器预测整个回复的性质，区分实质性回答与样板回复。

Result: 在多种规模模型上的实验表明，首个token对数概率向量对不同回复类型形成明显可分离的聚类，能够高精度预测回复类型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用且计算简单的技术，通过早期终止或重定向到较小模型来优化LLM推理，显著节省计算成本，推动更高效可持续的LLM部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaCoT是一种在检索前阶段应用对比思维的新框架，通过生成对比性问题来引导模型关注关键差异细节，从而在单次检索中抑制语义干扰，提升RAG系统对知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统在处理知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询时面临的检索噪声问题，避免昂贵的后处理成本，突破单向量查询同时编码关注和忽略信号的理论瓶颈。

Method: 在检索前阶段自动生成语义相邻但答案不同的对比性问题，提取Δ-Prompt捕获关键差异，引导模型主动关注决定答案分歧的关键细节。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中（包括PopQA和TriviaQA-unfiltered），RaCoT比RankRAG和Self-RAG等强基线方法提升了0.9-2.4个百分点，在对抗性测试中性能下降仅8.6%，远低于其他方法的15%以上下降，具有低延迟（3.12秒）和低token开销（11.54）。

Conclusion: RaCoT将RAG范式从"事后上下文清理"重构为"先验塑造判别推理"，为实时、资源受限部署的可靠AI系统提供了高效且鲁棒的路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着各大公司不断改进大语言模型，了解不同模型在性能、道德行为和可用性方面的差异变得至关重要，这些差异反映了它们背后的设计理念。

Method: 通过分析三个重要因素：性能与准确性、伦理与偏见缓解、可用性与集成，对五个顶级LLM进行比较评估。

Result: Claude在道德推理方面表现良好，Gemini在多模态能力和伦理框架方面更强，DeepSeek擅长基于事实的推理，LLaMA适合开放应用，ChatGPT提供平衡性能并注重用户体验。

Conclusion: 这些模型在工作效果、易用性和伦理处理方面存在显著差异，用户应根据各自优势选择最适合的模型来最大化利用价值。

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

TL;DR: 开发了一个事实验证框架，通过交叉检查LLM输出与多个知识源来实时捕获和纠正幻觉错误，将幻觉减少67%，同时保持响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM会自信地生成听起来完全合理但实际上是错误的信息，这种幻觉问题已成为在准确性至关重要的现实应用中部署这些模型的主要障碍。

Method: 结合结构化数据库、实时网络搜索和学术文献来验证生成的事实声明，检测到不一致时自动纠正，同时保持响应的自然流畅性。

Result: 在各种领域的测试中，幻觉减少了67%，且不牺牲响应质量。医疗、金融和科学研究领域的专家对纠正后输出的满意度达到89%，相比未验证的LLM响应有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在事实错误不可接受的应用中使LLM更可信提供了一个实用的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

TL;DR: Jarvis框架通过个人KV-Cache检索实现个性化AI助手，在视觉和文本token中存储用户特定信息，在回答问题时检索相关KV-Cache以确保准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么学习概念token集合，要么训练VLM使用用户特定信息，但都难以生成准确答案。需要更有效的个性化AI助手方案。

Method: 使用个人KV-Cache检索框架，将用户信息总结为元数据创建文本token，从用户图像中提取独特图像块创建视觉token，回答问题前检索相关KV-Cache。

Result: Jarvis能够提供更准确的响应，特别是在依赖特定局部细节时。在多个数据集的视觉问答和纯文本任务中达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: Jarvis为个性化AI助手提供了一条实用路径，通过KV-Cache检索机制有效利用用户特定信息提高回答准确性。

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理开发缺乏对人类工作方式的理解，需要揭示代理在多样化工作流程中的专业能力和角色定位。

Method: 引入可扩展工具包，从人类或代理的计算机使用活动中提取可解释的结构化工作流程，并进行直接比较分析。

Result: 代理倾向于程序化方法，工作质量较差但存在数据伪造；代理完成任务速度快88.3%，成本低90.4-96.2%。

Conclusion: 代理在可编程任务上具有效率优势，适合与人类协作，但需要解决工作质量和诚信问题。

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Motivation: Microsoft Copilot套件作为各种代理的通用入口点，需要强大的编排器来将用户提示的任务分发到正确的代理，特别是当代理库动态扩展时。

Method: 提出了代理元编排器(AMO)，利用元学习训练决策树模型来决定不同代理/模型之间的最佳推理策略，支持自然语言和动作响应。

Result: 在两个生产用例中展示了AMO的有效性：M365电子商务Copilot提供最新产品信息并连接到多个代理；代码合规Copilot扫描内部DevOps代码以检测合规问题。

Conclusion: AMO为Copilot服务提供了一个可扩展的多代理编排解决方案，通过元学习优化推理策略选择，在实际生产环境中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

TL;DR: HRM-Agent是HRM的强化学习变体，能够在动态不确定的迷宫环境中学习导航到目标，并成功重用先前时间步的计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRM虽然在小规模下具有出色的推理能力，但仅限于监督式、静态、完全可观测的问题，无法处理动态、不确定或部分可观测的现实问题。

Method: 开发HRM-Agent，使用纯强化学习训练HRM变体，探索其循环推理过程的动态特性。

Result: HRM-Agent能够在动态不确定的迷宫环境中学习导航，其循环推理过程成功重用了早期环境时间步的计算。

Conclusion: HRM可以通过强化学习扩展到动态不确定环境，其推理能力源于循环推理过程对先前计算的重用。

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

Motivation: 人类在熟练任务后会减少认知努力，而传统强化学习智能体在提升性能时计算效率不会改善。如果智能体能够像人类一样在掌握技能后减少计算需求，就能实现更节能的智能体或释放计算资源用于其他任务。

Method: 在Arcade Learning Environment中实验，向智能体展示计算成本并赋予它们控制计算使用的能力，让智能体在训练过程中自主决定何时使用计算资源。

Result: 在相同训练计算预算下，考虑计算成本的智能体在75%的游戏中表现更好，平均使用计算量减少了三倍。

Conclusion: 让强化学习智能体在训练过程中考虑计算成本是可行的，能够显著提高计算效率，为开发更节能的智能体提供了新方向。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Bridging-Modality-Gap.

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the

Conclusion: GTR-Mamba通过跨流形条件路由成功解决了同时建模空间层次结构和时间上下文动态变化的问题，为POI推荐提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

Conclusion: MA-CDMP通过扩散模型和均值场机制有效解决了去中心化资源管理中的挑战，提供了理论保证和实际性能提升

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出InSUR框架，通过多维度指令不确定性减少来生成更满意的语义约束对抗样本，解决了现有方法在语义不确定性方面的不足。


<details>

Motivation: 当前生成语义约束对抗样本的方法攻击能力不足，未能充分研究人类指令中的语义不确定性因素，如指称多样性、描述不完整性和边界模糊性。

Method: 提出多维度指令不确定性减少框架：1）采样方法维度：残差驱动攻击方向稳定化；2）任务建模维度：上下文编码攻击场景约束；3）生成器评估维度：语义抽象攻击评估增强。

Result: 实验证明InSUR在转移攻击性能上具有优越性，并首次实现了无参考的语义约束3D对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: InSUR框架通过全面处理语义不确定性，能够生成更有效、可转移和自适应的语义约束对抗样本。

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够为不同用户类型提供高效可信解释的通用框架，解决现有解释方法在用户适配性和解释质量方面的局限性。

Method: 结合SHAP、LIME、Anchor等后置解释器与检索增强的大型语言模型，构建多模态知识库索引，通过量化标准选择最佳解释器，使用聊天提示生成基于知识的解释叙述。

Result: 在心脏病和甲状腺癌数据集上的评估显示：LIME在保真度-鲁棒性权衡方面表现最佳；Anchor产生最稀疏、低token的规则；SHAP获得最高满意度。Profile条件化稳定了token使用并保持各用户配置文件的积极评分。

Conclusion: ProfileXAI框架能够为不同用户类型提供高效可信的解释，没有单一解释器在所有指标上占优，但通过配置文件条件化可以实现稳定的解释质量。

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity-robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy
explanations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in
generating diagnostic conclusions from imaging findings, thereby supporting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散规划器从稀疏步规划中受益，但过度稀疏的规划会降低性能。作者假设时间密度阈值在整个时间范围内是非均匀的，某些部分的轨迹应该更密集地规划。

Method: 提出了混合密度扩散器（MDD），其中整个时间范围内的密度是可调的超参数，允许在不同时间区域采用不同的规划密度。

Result: MDD在Maze2D、Franka Kitchen和Antmaze D4RL任务领域实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过允许在整个时间范围内调整规划密度，MDD能够更好地捕捉长期依赖关系，同时避免过度稀疏规划带来的性能下降。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transition from a
computational instrument to an autonomous originator of scientific knowledge.
This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the
complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final
synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape
the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured
proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape,
obscuring overarching methodological principles and developmental trends. This
survey provides a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of this domain by
introducing a unified, six-stage methodological framework that deconstructs the
end-to-end scientific process into: Literature Review, Idea Generation,
Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper
Generation. Through this analytical lens, we chart the field's evolution from
early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems
(2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and
Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these
developments, this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous
science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining
challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation
of systems toward becoming trustworthy and indispensable partners in human
scientific inquiry.

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成高质量代码方面仍面临挑战，需要奖励模型作为推理模型发展的必要中间步骤。虽然模型反思能力通常随规模增大而增强，但本研究旨在探索先进的小型语言模型是否能转化为可用的奖励模型。

Method: 构建基于APPS编程挑战基准的代码样本数据集，包含正确性标签。训练带有回归层的价值头模型，用于估计中间输出的成功概率，将解码器专用transformer模型转化为奖励模型。

Result: 评估显示小型LLM能够作为有效的奖励模型或代码评估批评器，成功从多个候选中识别正确解决方案。使用该批评器，在多代代码生成中搜索最准确代码的能力提升了超过20%。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型可以被有效地转化为奖励模型，在代码评估任务中表现出色，为代码生成质量的改进提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

TL;DR: 科学大语言模型在处理生物分子序列时面临标记化困境，研究发现提供高层次结构化上下文比直接处理原始序列更有效，上下文单独方法在所有任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学大语言模型在处理原始生物分子序列时面临的标记化困境，无论是将序列视为专门语言还是单独模态，都会限制模型的推理能力。

Method: 通过系统比较领先的科学大语言模型在生物推理任务上的表现，测试了三种输入模式：仅序列、仅上下文以及两者结合。

Result: 上下文单独方法在所有模式中表现最佳且显著优于其他方法。令人惊讶的是，将原始序列与高层次上下文结合反而会降低性能，表明原始序列即使对具有专门标记化方案的模型也是信息噪声。

Conclusion: 现有科学大语言模型的主要优势不在于从零开始解释生物分子语法的能力，而在于对结构化、人类可读知识的深度推理能力。应将科学大语言模型重新定位为专家知识的强大推理引擎。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

Motivation: 现有技能发现方法只关注技能多样性最大化，不考虑人类偏好，导致产生不良行为甚至危险技能

Method: 从基础模型中提取评分函数评估状态，基于人类意图给期望状态高分、不良状态低分，然后用这些分数重新加权技能发现算法的奖励

Result: FoG成功消除了翻转、滚动等不良行为，在基于状态和像素的任务中都能避免危险区域，还能发现难以定义的行为技能

Conclusion: FoG方法有效将人类意图融入技能发现，解决了现有方法忽略人类偏好的问题

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

TL;DR: AUPO是一种对蒙特卡洛树搜索决策策略的改进方法，能自动进行动作抽象，仅依赖MCTS期间获得的奖励分布统计，无需转移概率或DAG搜索图，能检测对称动作，性能优于MCTS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动抽象算法需要访问转移概率或依赖有向无环搜索图，且在处理对称动作时存在局限，特别是在对称状态在状态空间中相距较远时。

Method: 提出AUPO作为MCTS决策策略的改进，仅使用MCTS过程中收集的奖励分布统计来自动构建动作抽象，不影响树搜索过程。

Result: 在IPPC基准问题上的比较显示，AUPO明显优于标准MCTS，且能检测到ASAP等先进框架难以处理的对称动作。

Conclusion: AUPO是一种有效的自动动作抽象方法，与仅影响树搜索的其他抽象技术兼容，无需额外信息即可提升MCTS性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BlocKOA的新算法，用于高效生成集成电路热仿真数据，相比现有方法实现了420倍加速，同时保持数据精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法需要大量高保真训练数据，导致计算成本高昂。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能同时加速数据生成过程并提高数据精度的算法。

Method: 使用基于热方程结构的块Krylov算法快速获取基础解，然后组合这些解得到满足物理约束的温度分布，最后应用热算子确定热源分布，从而高效生成精确数据点。

Result: BlocKOA的时间复杂度比现有方法低一个数量级，在生成5000个不同物理参数和IC结构芯片的热仿真数据时实现了420倍加速。仅用4%的生成时间，基于BlocKOA生成数据训练的数据驱动方法就能达到与现有方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: BlocKOA算法能显著加速集成电路热仿真数据的生成过程，同时保证数据精度，为数据驱动方法提供了高效的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNOT门是量子计算中的基本门，能产生纠缠这一量子算法关键资源。某些量子电路完全由CNOT门构成，因此最小化CNOT门数量至关重要，但该问题的计算复杂性尚未完全明确。

Method: 使用单一强化学习智能体处理固定尺寸m的电路，对不同尺寸的矩阵采用嵌入或高斯条纹化预处理。训练了m=8的智能体，并在n=3到15的矩阵上进行评估。

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

*Anwesha Das,John Duff,Jörg Hoffmann,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于理性沟通原则的自适应信号框架，用于优化人机协作中信息传递的时机和内容，确保用户在动态环境中保持准确认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速变化的环境中，辅助智能体需要识别最高优先级信息，并估计如何最有效地传递这些信息，因为人类注意力是零和认知资源。

Method: 使用贝叶斯参考解析和理性言语行为(RSA)建模框架，规划消息序列，优化用户信念与动态环境的及时对齐。智能体根据用户和场景特点调整消息的特异性和时机。

Result: 与基线方法比较显示，该方法的效果关键依赖于多步规划和现实用户意识模型的结合。

Conclusion: 这是RSA在动态环境通信和人机交互中的首次应用，为人类-智能体团队的语用通信建立了理论基础，展示了认知科学见解如何指导辅助智能体设计。

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

Conclusion: AutoStreamPipe框架通过LLM和思维超图的结合，成功实现了流处理管道的自动化设计和部署，显著提升了开发效率和准确性。

Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the
efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting
rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel
framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design,
generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe
bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific
implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured
multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an
extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution
strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good
accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that
AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates
(x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM
code-generation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有竞价模型通常针对特定场景设计，缺乏跨环境的泛化能力，需要开发能够适应多种竞价场景的统一基础模型。

Method: 构建Bid2X模型，使用统一序列嵌入编码异构数据，采用双注意力机制分别处理变量间依赖和时间动态依赖，通过变量感知融合模块进行自适应预测，并设计零膨胀投影模块处理竞价数据分布。

Conclusion: Bid2X作为竞价基础模型在计算广告领域具有良好表现和泛化能力，为竞价基础模型的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

Conclusion: 通过原则性因果推理为深度强化学习智能体能力提升提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

Motivation: 提醒人们注意线性风险模型的哲学局限性，探讨在认知冷漠情境下AI灾难概率评估的结构性问题。

Method: 分析作者使用的风险模型，比较标准瑞士奶酪模型与本文模型的差异，讨论在认知冷漠情境下P(D)概率的结构性关系，区分风险与不确定性概念。

Result: 论证在认知冷漠情境下P(D)概率高于初步预期，识别影响P(D)评估的两种不确定性：选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性。

Conclusion: 将不确定性维度纳入AI生存风险的定性讨论中，能够更好地理解P(D)的可能性，提供更全面的风险评估框架。

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的策略感知控制器，通过六阶段推理框架将自然语言请求与书面策略进行匹配，实现安全、合规且可追溯的访问决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业需要满足最小权限、合规性和可审计性的访问决策，但现有系统难以将人类可读策略转化为机器决策。

Method: 使用Google Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM，采用六阶段推理框架（上下文解释、用户验证、数据分类、业务目的测试、合规映射、风险综合），结合早期硬策略门控和默认拒绝机制。

Result: 在14个标准案例测试中，精确决策匹配率从10/14提升到13/14（92.9%），拒绝召回率达到1.00，必须拒绝场景的误批准率降为0，功能适当性和合规性均达到14/14。

Conclusion: 策略约束的LLM推理结合显式门控和审计追踪，能够将人类可读策略转化为安全、合规且可追溯的机器决策。

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Conclusion: 该框架为人类与AI协作提供了理论基础和实践方法，能够适应分布漂移和人类行为变化，显著提升决策系统的可靠性。

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Result: 在MAFW和DFEW数据集上显著提高了解释-预测一致性和解释情感准确性，通过实验和人工评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了解释与预测的对齐，还使多模态大语言模型能够提供情感一致、可信赖的交互，是实现真正类人HCI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

TL;DR: ReCode提出了一种通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动的新范式，在单一代码表示中实现多粒度决策控制，显著提升了LLM智能体的推理性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界任务需要不同粒度的决策，人类通过统一认知表示实现灵活规划，但现有LLM智能体缺乏跨粒度操作能力，因为传统范式将高级规划与低级行动严格分离，限制了动态适应性和泛化能力。

Method: ReCode将高级规划视为抽象占位函数，通过递归分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到达到原始行动，从而消除规划与行动之间的刚性边界，实现动态决策粒度控制。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReCode在推理性能上显著超越先进基线方法，并在训练中表现出卓越的数据效率，验证了通过递归代码生成统一规划与行动的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的有力且有效方法，递归结构自然生成丰富的多粒度训练数据，使模型能够学习分层决策过程。

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

TL;DR: ChatGPT发布后，公众对AI的接受度下降，对人监督需求增加，社会不平等加剧


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI技术快速普及背景下，公众对AI态度变化，特别是决策场景中的接受度

Method: 在瑞士进行大规模两波调查（n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488），比较ChatGPT发布前后的态度变化

Result: 生成式AI热潮显著降低公众对AI接受度，完全不可接受比例从23%升至30%；仅支持人类决策比例从18%升至26%；教育、语言和性别差距扩大

Conclusion: 挑战行业对公众AI部署准备度的假设，强调技术发展需与公众偏好保持一致的重要性

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

TL;DR: 提出了MAE框架，通过多智能体自进化机制增强LLM的推理能力，无需人类标注数据，在多个基准测试中平均提升4.54%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法依赖人工标注数据和可验证奖励，限制了可扩展性和通用性。自博弈RL方法需要特定环境反馈，难以扩展到通用领域

Method: MAE框架包含三个交互智能体（提议者、求解者、评判者），均基于单一LLM实例化，通过强化学习优化行为。提议者生成问题，求解者尝试解决，评判者评估并共同进化

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct上的实验显示，MAE在数学、推理和常识问答等多个基准测试中平均提升4.54%

Conclusion: MAE是一种可扩展、数据高效的方法，能以最小的人类监督依赖增强LLM的通用推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

Motivation: 当前的自进化代理主要局限于提示重写或失败重试，需要更系统的方法将通用代理转化为领域专家。

Method: 框架包含三个步骤：执行目标领域任务并从中合成候选MCP；将MCP抽象为参数化基元并整合到MCP Box；在推理时执行检索增强的MCP选择，并使用MCP执行器运行代理。

Result: 在GAIA验证集上达到83.03% pass@1和89.09% pass@3的新SOTA结果，同时将每个示例的平均token数减少约15%。

Conclusion: ALITA-G提供了从通用能力到可重用领域特定能力的原理性路径，在复杂推理任务上同时提高了准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In this article, we have developed a computational model to determine the
droplet formation regime and its transition in a square microfluidic
flow-focusing device that eventually dictate the droplet shape, size, and its

physicochemical parameters on the droplet dynamics and flow regime transition,
which are essential in the development of new methods for on-demand droplet
generation. On the basis of the droplet formation mechanism, we have formulated
flow maps for different liquid-liquid systems, and have also proposed a scaling
law to predict the droplet length for a wide range of operating condition
resulting from the variation of flow rates, and viscosities of the continuous
phase as well as the interfacial tension. This work can effectively contribute
in providing helpful guidelines on the design and operations of droplet-based
flow-focusing microfluidic systems.

TL;DR: 实验研究惯性球体通过密度分层界面的沉降动力学，发现粒子弗劳德数比值Fr2/Fr1≤0.142是区分弹跳与非弹跳情况的关键条件，现有仅基于密度比的模型无法准确预测保留时间和弹跳行为。

Motivation: 研究惯性球体在密度分层界面沉降时的动力学行为，特别是导致显著减速和"弹跳"现象的条件，这对理解沉积、分离和生物地球物理传输过程具有重要意义。

Method: 使用同步粒子追踪和流动可视化技术，在水-盐和水-甘油分层系统中进行实验，扩展了参数空间以包含显著的粘度对比。

Result: 确定了粒子弗劳德数比值Fr2/Fr1≤0.142作为区分弹跳与非弹跳情况的关键条件，该比值可以用密度和粘度对比表示，揭示了惯性、粘度和分层共同控制粒子保留的机制。

Conclusion: 惯性、粘度和密度分层共同控制粒子在界面处的保留行为，现有仅基于密度比的模型不足以准确预测沉降动力学，弗劳德数比值提供了更可靠的判据。

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the dynamics of inertial spheres settling
through density-stratified interfaces, focusing on the conditions that lead to
pronounced deceleration and ``bouncing''. Using synchronized particle tracking
and flow visualization in both water-salt and water-glycerol stratifications,
we extend the parameter space of previous studies to include significant
viscosity contrasts. We show that existing models based solely on density
ratios fail to capture the observed retention times and bouncing behavior.
Instead, we identify the ratio of particle Froude numbers across the interface,
$Fr_2/Fr_1 \le 0.142$, as the critical condition distinguishing bouncing from
non-bouncing cases. Using a drag-law of the form $C_d = \alpha Re^{-\beta}$,
this ratio can be expressed in terms of density and viscosity contrasts. The
results reveal how inertia, viscosity, and stratification jointly control
particle retention, with implications for sedimentation, separation, and
biogeophysical transport processes.

Abstract: This study explores how the distribution of surface charge along corrugated
nanochannels affects flow rates and influences ionic currents and charge
selectivity in a pressure gradient-driven flow. We numerically solve the
coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes (PNPS) equations for periodic aperture
profiles and explore how changes in the Debye screening length and the degree
of symmetry between surface charge and geometry, and the magnitude of an
applied pressure gradient affect the velocity profile. We identify three
regimes of flow: I. At low (no) pressure gradients, the inhomogeneous
distribution of surface charge generates a nonlinear torque that drives
recirculating flow. Placing surface charge asymmetrically with respect to the
geometry produces a net axial flow. II. At moderate pressure gradients, the
flow rate is proportional to the mechanical driving force, though is
significantly diminished relative to channels absent of surface charge
inhomogeneity. Throughput is inhibited by the electrostatic force that opposes
the displacement of ions from the diffuse part of the electric double layer.
III. At high pressure gradients, we demonstrate a transition between
electrostatically and mechanically controlled flow regimes, where -- under
appropriate choice of parameters -- a marginal increase in the applied pressure
gradient triggers an abrupt, orders-of-magnitude increase in the mean velocity.
By incorporating the computed velocity and electric fields from the PNPS
equations into a random walk particle tracking algorithm, we provide a detailed
quantitative characterization of the transport dynamics of the ions,
demonstrating the ability to selectively control the flux of charge and
moderate the rate of ion dispersion.

Abstract: Numerical simulation of the transonic shock buffet phenomenon remains a
formidable challenge due to its inherent nonlinear and unsteady
characteristics. These difficulties are further compounded in three-dimensional
configurations and when aeroelastic coupling is considered. Consequently,
computational studies of aeroelastic shock buffet interactions have largely
been confined to two-dimensional systems. This limitation underscores the need
for reduced-order models (ROMs) capable of efficiently and accurately capturing
the aeroelastic response of structures subjected to shock buffet oscillations.
This paper presents a novel nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic ROM that integrates
nonlinear oscillator dynamics with Volterra theory to model aeroelastic shock
buffet phenomena. The coefficients and terms of the resulting
Integro-Differential Equation ROM (IDE-ROM) are identified using the Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Application of the IDE-ROM to an OAT15A
airfoil demonstrates that the compact and computationally efficient formulation
can reproduce key nonlinear behaviors, including aeroelastic lock-in, with a
high degree of accuracy. The limitations and potential extensions of the
proposed approach are also critically examined.

Method: 采用直接数值模拟方法，对15种不同粗糙度高度和流向波数的案例进行系统研究，分析叶片吸力侧边界层的转捩现象。

Result: 大粗糙度高度导致边界层在叶片前缘区域剧烈扰动并保持湍流状态；小粗糙度高度时扰动在下游被抑制，直到叶片后缘分离才发生转捩；中等粗糙度时流向波数对转捩时机有重要影响。

Conclusion: 叶片几何形状、复杂压力梯度分布和粗糙度配置的共同作用导致了边界层行为的复杂性，粗糙度参数对转捩过程和分离抑制具有显著影响。

Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of a low-pressure turbine with roughness
elements distributed over the blade surface have been performed. A series of
fifteen cases with varying roughness heights and streamwise wavenumbers are
introduced to present a systematic study of the effect of roughness on the
various transition phenomena in the suction-side boundary layer. For cases with
large roughness heights, the boundary layer is violently disturbed by the wake
of rough elements in the leading edge (LE) region, and maintains the turbulent
state over the whole blade suction-side. For cases with small roughness
heights, however, the disturbances induced by the LE roughness are suppressed
by the favourable pressure gradient in the downstream boundary layer, and the
relaminarized flow does not undergo transition until the separation near the
blade trailing edge (TE). Furthermore, the streamwise wavenumber of the
distributed roughness plays an important role in cases with intermediate
roughness height. Specifically, cases with larger streamwise slope show earlier
transition induced by strong shear layer instability, which manages to suppress
the mean flow separation near the TE region. Overall, the combined effect of
several factors, including the geometric effect at the blade LE and TE, the
complex pressure gradient distribution across the turbine vane, and the various
roughness configurations, is responsible for the intriguing boundary layer
behaviours in the present study.

Abstract: We present evidence of the hysteretic nature of dissipation in unsteady
turbulent flows. Wind tunnel experiments and direct numerical simulations in
oscillating flows show that, at fixed mean Reynolds number, the dissipation
constant is larger for decelerating flows. Consequently, a periodic behavior of
the flow produces a hysteresis cycle, whose area scales with a parameter
combining the Strouhal number and the relative amplitude of the forcing. This
phenomenon can be explained and quantified through the influence of the
unsteady term in the Karman-Howarth equation, with implications for a wide
range of out-of-equilibrium systems.

Abstract: Classic turbulence models often struggle to accurately predict complex flows
that involve phenomena such as flow separation. Although data-driven techniques
have emerged to address these shortcomings by augmenting classical models with
correction terms, most existing research has concentrated on two-dimensional
(2D) cases. Therefore, the performance of these corrected models in complex
three-dimensional (3D) flows remains an underexplored area. This study
addresses this gap by enhancing a data-driven turbulence model, the SST-CND
(shear stress transport-conditioned) model, which was originally trained on 2D
separated flows. An additional correction term, \b{eta}_3D, is introduced to
account for 3D effects. The distribution of this term is initially determined
through a 3D field inversion process using high-fidelity data obtained from the
flow around a cube. An explicit algebraic expression for \b{eta}_3D is then
derived through symbolic regression and formulated to degrade to zero in 2D
cases. This new expression is integrated into the original model, resulting in
the SST-CND3D model. The performance of the SST-CND3D model is evaluated across
a range of flows. In 2D flows, including the separated flow around a hump, flow
over a flat plate, and flow around a multi-element airfoil, the SST-CND3D model
performs identically to its 2D-trained predecessor. However, the model exhibits
superior performance in 3D flows, such as the flow around a cube and the
complex, real-world JAXA standard model high-lift configuration. These findings
indicate that a sequential correction approach, constructing a 3D correction
term that vanishes in 2D on top of a 2D-trained model, constitutes a promising
method for developing data-driven turbulence models that maintain accuracy in
3D while preserving their effectiveness in 2D.

Method: 采用增强延迟分离涡模拟方法，对比分析清洁机翼、连续冰形和间断冰形三种配置的气动性能和流动结构。

Result: 间断冰形导致更严重的升力损失，但阻力增加较小；连续冰形形成大分离泡维持升力，间断冰形通过间隙射流破坏前缘涡形成；识别出三个特征斯特劳哈尔数（11.3、22.6、33.9），其中22.6对应由间隙射流引起的升阻力波动频率。

Conclusion: 间断冰形与连续冰形在气动特性和流动结构上存在显著差异，间断冰形不会导致突然失速，但升力损失更严重，间隙射流是影响流动特性的关键因素。

Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic performance and flow structures of
infinite swept wings with artificially simulated discontinuous ice using an
enhanced delayed detached-eddy simulation. Comparisons are made among clean,
continuous-ice, and discontinuous-ice configurations. Results show that
discontinuous ice causes a more severe reduction in lift than continuous ice.
While continuous ice forms a large separation bubble that helps maintain lift,
discontinuous ice disrupts leading-edge vortex formation through gap jets,
resulting in greater lift loss but a smaller drag penalty. Unlike the
continuous-ice wing, the discontinuous-ice case does not exhibit a sudden
stall-induced lift drop. The flow over the discontinuous-ice wing can be
characterized by two canonical patterns: a separating shear layer and
K\'arm\'an vortex shedding. However, the separating shear layer becomes
irregular due to the interference of gap jets. Three characteristic chord-based
Strouhal numbers (St)-11.3, 22.6, and 33.9-are identified. The lowest (St=11.3)
corresponds to the shedding of vortex pairs; when nondimensionalized by the ice
width, it yields St = 0.58, which is higher than that of a canonical cylinder
wake. Furthermore, lift and drag fluctuations occur predominantly at St = 22.6,
twice the shedding frequency, primarily induced by the gap jets-a phenomenon
absent in the continuous-ice case.

Abstract: We present a unified numerical framework for simulating turbulent thermal
convection and phase-change dynamics in coupled fluid-porous media systems. The
framework is designed to handle high solid-to-fluid thermal conductivity
contrast and spatiotemporally varying porosity. It combines a Darcy-Brinkman
formulation with a modified phase-field method to achieve smooth two-way
coupling across transitioning interfaces. The model integrates momentum,
energy, solute transport, and phase evolution equations. A factorized
operator-splitting approach with second-order temporal accuracy is employed to
ensure computational efficiency. The numerical method is rigorously validated
using a range of benchmark problems. These include channel flow over permeable
substrates, thermal convection in porous-fluid layers, 1D Stefan and 2D
pure-water phase changing, double-diffusive convection in porous media, and
seawater solidification. The results show good agreement with existing
experiments and simulations.

### [418] [Gauss Principle in Incompressible Flow: Unified Variational Perspective on Pressure and Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22925)

TL;DR: 该论文阐明了Gauss-Appell原理在不可压缩无粘流动中的作用，及其与经典投影方法的联系。该原理通过求解Poisson-Neumann问题得到反应压力，执行瞬时运动学约束，恢复Euler方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清Gauss-Appell原理在不可压缩无粘流动中的具体作用，以及它如何与经典投影方法相关联，为计算流体力学提供更清晰的理论基础。

Method: 在固定时间冻结速度场，仅变化材料加速度，通过最小化二次函数并施加加速度级约束，得到一阶条件，从而导出Poisson-Neumann问题求解反应压力。

Result: Gauss-Appell原理能够强制执行瞬时运动学约束，在瞬时恢复Euler方程，但不能选择环量或驻点等速度状态属性。该原理为计算不兼容性提供了诊断工具。

Conclusion: 该研究为Gauss原理的应用提供了更清晰的理解，并将其与势流理论、投影算法和近期变分方法等已知概念具体联系起来。

Abstract: Following recent work (Gonzalez and Taha 2022; Peters and Ormiston 2025),
this manuscript clarifies what the Gauss-Appell principle determines in
incompressible, inviscid flow and how it connects to classical projection
methods. At a fixed time, freezing the velocity and varying only the material
acceleration leads to minimization of a quadratic subject to acceleration-level
constraints. First-order conditions yield a Poisson-Neumann problem for a
reaction pressure whose gradient removes the non-solenoidal and wall-normal
content of the provisional residual, i.e. the Leray-Hodge projection. Thus,
Gauss-Appell enforces the instantaneous kinematic constraints and recovers
Euler at the instant. In steady flows, this principle cannot select circulation
or stagnation points because these are properties of the velocity state, not
the instantaneous acceleration correction. The principle only determines the
reaction pressure for an already-specified velocity field. The
impressed/reaction pressure decomposition can be supplemented with
orthogonality conditions, allowing physical inputs (e.g. circulation,
freestream) to be embedded while maintaining exact constraint enforcement. This
variational viewpoint provides a diagnostic for computational incompatibility:
In a practical computation, spikes in projection effort may signal problematic
boundary conditions or under-resolution, and clarifies how pressure
instantaneously maintains solenoidality without creating or destroying
vorticity. The goal of this note is simply to lend more clarity to the
application of the Gauss principle, and to connect it concretely to well known
concepts including potential flow theory, projection algorithms, and recent
variational approaches.

TL;DR: 开发了一个半经验模型来预测不完美膨胀超音速射流中冲击-不稳定性相互作用产生的宽带冲击相关噪声，该模型结合了修正的Pack模型和高斯波包模型，通过求解Helmholtz方程预测远场声学特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更准确地预测超音速射流中冲击-不稳定性相互作用产生的宽带噪声，需要建立能够考虑冲击衰减和不稳定性波衰减的物理模型。

Method: 使用半经验修正的Pack模型描述冲击衰减和间距变化，结合高斯波包模型描述不稳定性波，将近场压力扰动作为Helmholtz方程的边界值求解远场声学特性。

Result: 参数研究表明，减小不稳定性波衰减率会缩小频谱带宽和主瓣宽度，冲击间距变化会移动频谱峰值频率和主要辐射角度。模型验证显示考虑更真实的冲击参数显著提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: 改进后的模型成功再现了实验观测的关键频谱特征和指向性模式，特别是在非浅角区域能够准确捕捉主要辐射瓣及其频率相关的振幅和形状变化。

Abstract: A semi-empirical model is developed in this paper to predict the broadband
shock-associated noise (BBSAN) generated by shock-instability interaction (SII)
in imperfectly expanded supersonic jets. The model makes use of a
semi-empirically modified Pack's model that accounts for the decay in both
shock amplitude and shock spacing and a Gaussian wave-packet model for the
instability waves. The near-field pressure perturbation due to the SII is
treated as a boundary value for the Helmholtz equation, which is subsequently
solved to predict the far-field acoustic spectra and directivity patterns. A
comprehensive parametric study is conducted to reveal the effects of the key
parameters on the acoustic spectral and directivity features. It is found that
decreasing the instability-wave decay rate narrows the spectral bandwidth and
the major lobes in directivity patterns, while variations in shock spacing
shift the spectral peak frequency and the major radiation angle. Mechanisms of
such changes are discussed based on the model. Further validation against
multiple experimental datasets demonstrates that incorporating more realistic
parameters in the model-particularly those accounting for the shock spacing and
amplitude decays-considerably improves its prediction accuracy and physical
consistency. The improved model successfully reproduces several key spectral
features observed in experiments; these include, for example, the peak
frequency and the tendency of bandwidth contradiction as the observer angle
increases. Moreover, the predicted directivity patterns closely match the
experiments outside the shallow-angle region dominated by jet mixing noise. In
particular, it captures the major radiation lobes and their frequency-dependent
amplitude and shape variations.

Conclusion: 神经网络在障碍物密集环境中的流体模拟方面具有巨大潜力，可用于森林火灾烟雾、管道流体和洪水/水下流等应用。

Abstract: Conventional fluid simulations can be time consuming and energy intensive. We
researched the viability of a neural network for simulating incompressible
fluids in a randomized obstacle-heavy environment, as an alternative to the
numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equation. We hypothesized that the
neural network predictions would have a relatively low error for simulations
over a small number of time steps, but errors would eventually accumulate to
the point that the output would become very noisy. Over a rich set of obstacle
configurations, we achieved a root mean square error of 0.32% on our training
dataset and 0.36% on a testing dataset. These errors only grew to 1.45% and
2.34% at t = 10 and, 2.11% and 4.16% at timestep t = 20. We also found that our
selected neural network was approximately 8,800 times faster at predicting the
flow than a conventional simulation. Our findings indicate neural networks can
be extremely useful at simulating fluids in obstacle-heavy environments. Useful
applications include modeling forest fire smoke, pipe fluid flow, and
underwater/flood currents.

Motivation: 传统直接数值模拟(DNS)计算成本高昂，需要开发更高效的数值方法来研究沉降颗粒的微观动力学及其对集体运动的影响。

Method: 开发了Interaction-Decomposed Neural Network (IDNN)作为拉格朗日求解器中的黑盒模块，基于最近邻颗粒的相对位置预测粒子拖曳力，从而恢复力波动。

Result: 在稀薄状态下观察到集体沉降速度增加，这归因于：(i)流向粒子力围绕低于斯托克斯极限值的波动；(ii)形成以增强速度沉降的粒子团簇。能量谱显示存在类似湍流级联的尺度依赖性波动能量传递。

Conclusion: IDNN框架成功捕获了仅通过DNS才能获得的效果，揭示了低伽利略数下粒子间流体动力学相互作用的复杂机制，即使在极低体积分数下这种相互作用仍然显著。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behaviour of sedimenting solid particles
and the influence of microscopic particle dynamics on the collective motion of
a sedimenting cloud. Departing from conventional direct numerical simulations
(DNS), we introduce a novel machine learning framework, the
Interaction-Decomposed Neural Network (IDNN), to model hydrodynamic particle
interactions. The IDNN acts as a black-box module within a Lagrangian solver,
predicting the particle drag force based on the relative positions of the
nearest neighbours. This enables the recovery of force fluctuations, capturing
effects previously accessible only through DNS. Our results show an increase in
collective settling velocity in the dilute regime, consistent with earlier
experimental and numerical studies, which we attribute to (i) fluctuations in
the streamwise particle force around a value that is lower than the Stokes
limit and (ii) the formation of particle clusters sedimenting at enhanced
velocities. These fluctuations originate from persistent entrainment and
ejection of particles in and out of the long, diffusive wakes generated by
upstream particles at low Galileo numbers. Energy spectra of particle velocity
fluctuations reveal a scale-dependent transfer of fluctuation energy, analogous
to a turbulent-like cascade, with pronounced large-scale fluctuations at higher
volume fractions. At very low volume fractions, fluctuation intensity and
energy spectrum amplitudes diminish, though hydrodynamic interactions still
remain appreciable.

Conclusion: 该方法首次正式分析了忽略高阶方位模态贡献的误差，并改进了管壁自激振荡起始准则的确定。

Abstract: We present a theoretical description of the fluid--structure interaction
observed within a Starling resistor. The typical setup consists of a
pre-stretched finite length thin-walled elastic tube mounted between two rigid
tubes. The collapsible section is enclosed within a pressure chamber and a
viscous fluid is driven through the system by imposing an axial volume flux at
the downstream end. Valid within a long-wavelength thin-walled regime, we use
our own results to model the wall mechanics. These results arise from the
solution of a generalised eigenvalue problem, and avoid the need to invoke the
ad-hoc approximations made in previous studies. The wall mechanics are then
coupled to the fluid mechanics using the Navier--Stokes equations, under the
assumption that the oscillations in the tube wall are of small amplitude, long
wavelength and high frequency. We derive problems governing the leading-order
steady and oscillatory fluid-structure interaction. At leading order, the
system permits normal-mode oscillations of constant frequency and amplitude,
which are obtained in the form of series solutions. Higher-order corrections
govern the slow growth or decay of the oscillations, however (as in previous
work) these growth rates can be determined by analysing the system's global
energy budget without needing to compute the higher-order terms explicitly. Our
results permit the first formal analysis of the errors incurred by neglecting
contributions from higher-order azimuthal modes, and enable the determination
of improved criterion for the onset of self-excited oscillations in the tube
wall.

Motivation: 血液相关疾病治疗需要血小板富集血浆和红细胞，被动分离技术可避免组件在处理过程中受损或污染，因此需要设计有效的分离装置。

Conclusion: 三叉微通道设计通过细胞自由层的形成实现有效分离，几何参数和血液浓度是影响分离效率的关键因素。

Abstract: Platelet-enriched plasma and red blood cells (RBC) are needed in the
treatment of blood-related diseases, including anaemia and blood cancer. These
essential components must be separated from blood in well-designed experimental
setups. If active techniques are used, the blood components are likely to be
damaged or contaminated while handling. Passive techniques for component
separation are preferred, and their design for effectiveness before
manufacturing is the subject of this article. Specifically, the performance of
a design consisting of a trifurcated microchannel is examined in the framework
of 3D numerical simulation, following similar design ideas in recent
experimental studies. The influence of geometrical parameters of the channel,
such as width and separation arm angle, inlet extension, flow constriction, and
flow parameters, including flow rates, hematocrit concentration, and
temperature, is studied. The present study utilizes the diffusive flux model
(DFM) to model the shear-driven migration of red blood cells (RBC) in a
microchannel along with an appropriate rheology model. The physical mechanism
driving separation is the formation of the cell-free layer near the walls,
using which the separation efficiency and device effectiveness are quantified.
It is found that a microchannel with a smaller width and an extended inlet,
along with diluted blood samples of lower hematocrit, is effective for greater
separation, while the device performance is less sensitive to the flow rates,
flow constriction, and the separator angle.

Motivation: 喷射器工程建模中的阻塞机制仍存在争议，文献中提出了Fabri和复合阻塞两种机制，需要统一框架进行比较验证。

Method: 开发统一一维框架实现两种阻塞机制，与轴对称RANS数据进行横截面平均处理对比。复合模型包含壁面和流间摩擦、局部压力均衡程序及激波重构，Fabri模型通过提取RANS中的分流流线来评估。

Result: 校准后的复合模型在设计工况下预测二次质量流量误差通常在2%以内，Fabri分析在设计工况下夹带误差小于1%，但对分流流线和闭合条件高度敏感。

Conclusion: Fabri和复合机制可在同一设备和操作图中共存，各自捕捉不同的物理方面并提供互补建模价值，但复合阻塞是控制流量阻塞的更通用机制。

Abstract: Ejectors are passive devices used in refrigeration, propulsion, and process
industries to compress a secondary stream without moving parts. The engineering
modeling of choking in these devices remains an open question, with two
mechanisms-Fabri and compound choking-proposed in the literature. This work
develops a unified one-dimensional framework that implements both mechanisms
and compares them with axisymmetric Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) data
processed by cross-sectional averaging. The compound formulation incorporates
wall and inter-stream friction and a local pressure-equalization procedure that
enables stable integration through the sonic point, together with a normal
shock reconstruction. The Fabri formulation is assessed by imposing the
dividing streamline extracted from RANS, isolating the sonic condition while
avoiding additional modeling assumptions. The calibrated compound model
predicts on-design secondary mass flow typically within 2 % with respect to the
RANS simulations, rising to 5 % for a strongly under-expanded primary jet due
to the equal-pressure constraint. The Fabri analysis attains less than 1 %
error in on-design entrainment but exhibits high sensitivity to the dividing
streamline and closure, which limits predictive use beyond on-design. Overall,
the results show that Fabri and compound mechanisms can coexist within the same
device and operating map, each capturing distinct aspects of the physics and
offering complementary modeling value. Nevertheless, compound choking emerges
as the more general mechanism governing flow rate blockage, as evidenced by
choked flows with a subsonic secondary stream.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of surface functionalization, oil coating,
and oil absorption on droplet impact behavior on textured
polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) substrates. The textured surfaces were fabricated
with square micro-posts having spacings of 5 and 20 microns. The PDMS samples
were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to improve water
repellency. Following, the surfaces were either coated with or allowed to
absorb two different lubricants, silicone oil (SO-5cSt) and hexadecane. We
performed detailed wetting measurements on both untreated and
OTS-functionalized substrates. These measurements provided useful insights into
how water and lubricants were retained and distributed under static conditions.
High-speed imaging was used to capture droplet impact across a range of Weber
numbers. On SO-5cSt-absorbed substrates, droplets consistently showed complete
rebound at all Weber numbers, regardless of post spacing. This robust rebound
was attributed to the oil's ability to fill the gaps between the posts through
capillary action, while also forming a stable lubricating layer above the
texture. This thin oil film reduced friction between the droplet and the
surface, enabling the droplet to retain sufficient energy for complete rebound.
In contrast, hexadecane-absorbed substrates displayed different dynamics. At
low Weber numbers, only partial rebound was observed, while at intermediate
values, droplets rebounded completely. However, droplets no longer rebounded at
higher Weber numbers and remained deposited. Repeated droplet impacts further
demonstrated that hexadecane-infused surfaces gradually lost oil from the
textured gaps, resulting in a decline in rebound performance over time. This
effect was not observed with SO-5cSt, underscoring the importance of lubricant
affinity and stability.

Abstract: We present an anisotropic mesh adaptation procedure based on Riemannian
metrics for the simulation of two-phase incompressible flows with non-matching
densities. The system dynamics are governed by the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes
(CHNS) equations, discretized with mixed finite elements and implicit
time-stepping. Spatial accuracy is controlled throughout the simulation by the
\emph{global transient fixed-point method} from Alauzet \emph{et al.}, in which
the simulation time is divided into sub-intervals, each associated with an
adapted anisotropic mesh. The simulation is run in a fixed-point loop until
convergence of each mesh--solution pair. Each iteration takes advantage of the
previously computed solution and accurately predicts the flow variations. This
ensures that the mesh always captures the fluid-fluid interface, and allows for
a dynamic control of the interface thickness at a fraction of the computational
cost compared to uniform or isotropic grids. Moreover, using a modest number of
time sub-intervals reduces the transfer error from one mesh to another, which
would otherwise eventually spoil the numerical solution. The overall adaptive
procedure is verified with manufactured solutions and the well-known rising
bubble benchmark.

Abstract: We aim to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations within the complex
microstructure of a porous material. Discretizing the equations on a fine grid
using a staggered (e.g., marker-and-cell, mixed FEM) scheme results in a
nonlinear residual. Adopting the Newton method, a linear system must be solved
at each iteration, which is large, ill-conditioned, and has a saddle-point
structure. This demands an iterative (e.g., Krylov) solver, that requires
preconditioning to ensure rapid convergence. We propose two monolithic
\textit{algebraic} preconditioners, $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ and
$a\mathrm{PNM_{NS}}$, that are generalizations of previously proposed forms by
the authors for the Stokes equations ($a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ and
$a\mathrm{PNM_{S}}$). The former is based on the pore-level multiscale method
(PLMM) and the latter on the pore network model (PNM), both successful
approximate solvers. We also formulate faster-converging geometric
preconditioners $g\mathrm{PLMM}$ and $g\mathrm{PNM}$, which impose
$\partial_n\boldsymbol{u}\!=\!0$ (zero normal-gradient of velocity) exactly at
subdomain interfaces. Finally, we propose an accurate coarse-scale solver for
the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations based on $g\mathrm{PLMM}$, capable of
computing approximate solutions orders of magnitude faster. We benchmark our
preconditioners against state-of-the-art block preconditioners and show
$g\mathrm{PLMM}$ is the best-performing one, followed closely by
$a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ for steady-state flow and $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ for
transient flow. All preconditioners can be built and applied on parallel
machines.

generalized tensor-valued Stokes equation associated with the Hessian complex
in this paper. A discrete Helmholtz decomposition for the piecewise constant
space of traceless tensors is established, ensuring the well-posedness of the
nonconforming method, and optimal error estimates are derived. Building on
this, a low-order decoupled finite element method for the three-dimensional
triharmonic equation is constructed by combining the Morley-Wang-Xu element
methods for the biharmonic subproblems with the proposed nonconforming linear
element method. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence
rates.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the trace and diagonal entries of an
N-order tensor (where $N \geq 2$) under the framework where the tensor can only
be accessed through tensor-vector multiplication. The aim is to estimate the
tensor's diagonal entries and trace by minimizing the number of tensor-vector
queries. The seminal work of Hutchinson and its extended version due to Bekas
et al. give unbiased estimates of the trace and diagonal elements of a given
matrix, respectively, using matrix-vector queries. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no analogous results are known for estimating the trace and diagonal
entries of higher-order tensors using tensor-vector queries. This paper
addresses this gap and presents unbiased estimators for the trace and diagonal
entries of a tensor under this model. Our proposed methods can be seen as
generalizations of Hutchinson's and Bekas et al.'s estimators and reduce to
their estimators when N = 2. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of our
proposals and complement it with supporting simulations.

with understanding and enhancing the stability of neural networks. We focus on
a popular branch within this area which draws on connections to continuous
dynamical systems and optimal control, giving a bird's eye view of this area.

Abstract: The classical Davis-Kahan theorem provides an efficient bound on the
perturbation of eigenspaces of a matrix under a large (eigenvalue) gap

TL;DR: 本文分析了在椭圆PDE随机输入不确定性量化问题中，使用预积分近似cdf和pdf时的有限元误差分量，并给出了有限元与拟蒙特卡洛组合误差的界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作为Gilbert等人(2025)工作的延续，该论文专注于研究PDE空间离散化的有限元方法，而前文主要关注积分方面的拟蒙特卡洛求积规则。

Method: 首先证明有限元近似满足预积分理论所需假设（包括重要单调性条件），然后分析有限元误差，最后给出有限元与拟蒙特卡洛组合误差的界。

Result: 在类似假设下，cdf和pdf可以以与计算期望值这一更简单问题相同的收敛速率进行近似。

Conclusion: 有限元方法在预积分框架下能够有效处理椭圆PDE随机输入问题，cdf和pdf的近似收敛速率与期望值计算问题相当。

Abstract: This paper analyses the finite element component of the error when using
preintegration to approximate the cdf and pdf for uncertainty quantification
(UQ) problems involving elliptic PDEs with random inputs. It is a follow up to
Gilbert, Kuo, Srikumar, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 63 (2025), pp. 1025-1054, which
introduced a method of density estimation for a class of UQ problems, based on
computing the integral formulations of the cdf and pdf by performing an initial
smoothing preintegration step and then applying a quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature
rule to approximate the remaining high-dimensional integral. That paper
focussed on the quadrature aspect of the method, whereas this paper studies the
spatial discretisation of the PDE using finite element methods. First, it is
shown that the finite element approximation satisfies the required assumptions
for the preintegration theory, including the important monotonicity condition.
Then the finite element error is analysed and finally, the combined finite
element and quasi-Monte Carlo error is bounded. It is shown that under similar
assumptions, the cdf and pdf can be approximated with the same rate of
convergence as the much simpler problem of computing expected values.

Conclusion: FEX作为解决复杂PDE的强大透明框架，具有传统有限元、有限差分和黑盒神经网络方法通常缺乏的优势。

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with highly oscillatory
solutions on complex domains remains a challenging and important problem.
High-frequency oscillations and intricate geometries often result in
prohibitively expensive representations for traditional numerical methods and
lead to difficult optimization landscapes for machine learning-based
approaches. In this work, we introduce an enhanced Finite Expression Method
(FEX) designed to address these challenges with improved accuracy,
interpretability, and computational efficiency. The proposed framework
incorporates three key innovations: a symbolic spectral composition module that
enables FEX to learn and represent multiscale oscillatory behavior; a
redesigned linear input layer that significantly expands the expressivity of
the model; and an eigenvalue formulation that extends FEX to a new class of
problems involving eigenvalue PDEs. Through extensive numerical experiments, we
demonstrate that FEX accurately resolves oscillatory PDEs on domains containing
multiple holes of varying shapes and sizes. Compared with existing neural
network-based solvers, FEX achieves substantially higher accuracy while
yielding interpretable, closed-form solutions that expose the underlying
structure of the problem. These advantages, often absent in conventional finite
element, finite difference, and black-box neural approaches, highlight FEX as a
powerful and transparent framework for solving complex PDEs.

Result: 数值实验表明该方法优于现有方法，中间张量重用机制可减少10%-30%的运行时间且不影响恢复效果，对大规模数据效果更显著。

Conclusion: 提出的迹正则化FCTN分解方法有效提升了张量补全的局部细节恢复性能，算法收敛性得到理论证明，计算效率通过重用机制得到显著提升。

Abstract: The fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition has gained prominence
in the field of tensor completion owing to its powerful capacity to capture the
low-rank characteristics of tensors. Nevertheless, the recovery of local
details in the reconstructed tensor still leaves scope for enhancement. In this
paper, we propose efficient tensor completion model that incorporates trace
regularization within the FCTN decomposition framework. The trace
regularization is constructed based on the mode-$k$ unfolding of the FCTN
factors combined with periodically modified negative laplacian. The trace
regularization promotes the smoothness of the FCTN factors through discrete
second-order derivative penalties, thereby enhancing the continuity and local
recovery performance of the reconstructed tensor. To solve the proposed model,
we develop an efficient algorithm within the proximal alternating minimization
(PAM) framework and theoretically prove its convergence. To reduce the runtime
of the proposed algorithm, we design an intermediate tensor reuse mechanism
that can decrease runtime by 10\%-30\% without affecting image recovery, with
more significant improvements for larger-scale data. A comprehensive complexity
analysis reveals that the mechanism attains a reduced computational complexity.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
approaches.

Abstract: We consider the optimization of a neural network previously developed by the
authors for the joint inversion of 3D gravitational and magnetic fields in the
context of mineral exploration. The distinctive feature of this neural network
is that it solves ill-posed (ill-conditioned) inverse problems. The neural
network implements a special two-level algorithm. The lower level of the
algorithm uses two neural networks with equivalent architectures. The first of
them computes the gravitational field sources in a given domain from
measurements of this field on a remote surface. The second neural network
processes magnetic field measured on the same surface to find magnetic sources
in the same domain. The found source distributions are used at the upper level
of the algorithm to calculate their structural residual, which determines the
degree of difference (closeness) of their geometries. As a result, minimizing
this residual, when training a neural network at the upper level, implements a
computational algorithm that yields geometrically close source distributions of
different fields. The article examines in detail the possibilities of
optimizing some elements of the neural networks and the algorithms used
(datasets, training process, specific form of loss functions, etc.) Test
calculations for model problem demonstrate high quality of joint inversion by
our optimized neural networks approach. Calculations were also carried out for
the joint processing of real-feald data from gravity and magnetic exploration
in Jussara region, Goias State, Brazil. The article also considers the issue of
determining in joint field inversion not only the geometric distribution of
sources, but also their physical intensities.

Motivation: 传统DD-GPCE方法需要输入分布的完整先验知识，这在实践中往往不可得，限制了该方法在高维输入不确定性量化中的应用。

Method: 使用平滑自助核密度估计从样本数据推断输入分布，通过维度分解框架处理高维输入，然后进行白化变换生成度量一致的正交基函数。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据驱动DD-GPCE方法有效扩展了不确定性量化在高维输入场景下的适用性，无需分布先验知识即可获得准确结果。

Abstract: Dimensionally decomposed generalized polynomial chaos expansion (DD-GPCE)
efficiently performs forward uncertainty quantification (UQ) in complex
engineering systems with high-dimensional random inputs of arbitrary
distributions. However, constructing the measure-consistent orthonormal
polynomial bases in DD-GPCE requires prior knowledge of input distributions,
which is often unavailable in practice. This work introduces a data-driven
DD-GPCE method that eliminates the need for such prior knowledge, extending its
applicability to UQ with high-dimensional inputs. Input distributions are
inferred directly from sample data using smoothed-bootstrap kernel density
estimation (KDE), while the DD-GPCE framework enables KDE to handle
high-dimensional inputs through low-dimensional marginal estimation. We then
use the estimated input distributions to perform a whitening transformation via
Monte Carlo Simulation, which enables generation of measure-consistent
orthonormal basis functions. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method
in both mathematical examples and stochastic dynamic analysis for a practical
three-dimensional mobility design involving twenty random inputs. The results
indicate that the proposed method produces more accurate estimates of the
output mean and variance compared to the conventional data-driven approach that
assumes Gaussian input distributions.

Abstract: The dynamics of surface waves traveling along the boundary of a liquid medium
are changed by the presence of floating plates and membranes, contributing to a
number of important phenomena in a wide range of applications. Mathematically,
if the fluid is only partly covered by a plate or membrane, the order of
derivatives of the surface-boundary conditions jump between regions of the
surface. In this work, we consider a general class of problems for infinite
depth linearized surface waves in which the plate or membrane has a compact
hole or multiple holes. For this class of problems, we describe a general
integral equation approach, and for two important examples, the partial
membrane and the polynya, we analyze the resulting boundary integral equations.
In particular, we show that they are Fredholm second kind and discuss key
properties of their solutions. We develop flexible and fast algorithms for
discretizing and solving these equations, and demonstrate their robustness and
scalability in resolving surface wave phenomena through several numerical
examples.

Conclusion: 提出的HoSGFEM方法成功解决了高阶GFEM的稳定性问题，为椭圆界面问题提供了任意高阶的稳定数值解法。

Abstract: The Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) is an effective unfitted
numerical method for handling interface problems. By augmenting the standard
FEM space with an appropriate enrichment space, GFEM can accurately capture C^0
solutions across the interfaces. While numerous GFEMs for interface problems
have been studied, establishing a stable high-order GFEM with optimal
convergence rates and robust system conditioning remains a challenge. The
highest known order of two was established by Zhang and Babu\v{s}ka (SGFEM2,
Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 363 (2020), 112889). In this paper, we
propose a unified enrichment space construction and establish arbitrary
high-order stable GFEMs (HoSGFEM) for elliptic interface problems. The main
idea distinguishes itself from Zhang and Babu\v{s}ka's SGFEM2 substantially and
it is twofold: a) we construct dimensionality-reduced auxiliary locally
supported piecewise polynomials that satisfy the partition of unity property
for elements containing interfaces; b) we construct the enrichment scheme based
on d{1,(x-x_c^e),...,(y-y_c^e)^{p-1}} (d is the distance function; (x_c^e,
y_c^e) is the center of the element containing interface, thus element-based)
for arbitrary p-th order elements instead of d, d{1,x,y} or d{1,x,y,x^2,xy,y^2}
(global functions) for p=1,2 in the literature. This idea results in an
enrichment space that has a large angle with the standard FEM space, leading to
the stability of the method with system condition number growing in order
O(h^{-2}). We establish optimal convergence rates for HoSGFEM solutions under
the proposed construction. Various numerical experiments with both straight and
curved interfaces demonstrate the optimal convergence, FEM-comparable system
condition number with O(h^{-2}) growth, and robustness as element boundaries
approach interfaces.

Conclusion: 成功扩展了p-AAA算法到散乱数据场景，通过结构化矩阵和奇异值分解提供了高效的求解方案，增强了算法的适用性。

Abstract: Many algorithms for approximating data with rational functions are built on
interpolation or least-squares approximation. Inspired by the adaptive
Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for the univariate case, the parametric
adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (p-AAA) algorithm extends this idea to the
multivariate setting, combining least-squares and interpolation formulations
into a single effective approximation procedure. In its original formulation
p-AAA operates on grid data, requiring access to function samples at every
combination of discrete sampling points in each variable. In this work we
extend the p-AAA algorithm to scattered data sets, without requiring
uniform/grid sampling. In other words, our proposed p-AAA formulation operates
on a set of arbitrary sampling points and is not restricted to a grid structure
for the sampled data. Towards this goal, we introduce several formulations for
rational least-squares optimization problems that incorporate interpolation
conditions via constraints. We analyze the structure of the resulting
optimization problems and introduce structured matrices whose singular value
decompositions yield closed-form solutions to the underlying least-squares
problems. Several examples illustrate computational aspects and the
effectiveness of our proposed procedure.

Abstract: This work is concerned with relaxation models arising from numerical schemes
for hyperbolic-parabolic systems. Such models are a hyperbolic system with both
the hyperbolic part and the stiff source term involving a small positive
parameter, and thus are endowed with complicated multiscale properties.
Relaxation models are the basis of constructing corresponding numerical schemes
and a critical issue is the convergence of their solutions to those of the
given target systems, the justification of which is still lacking. In this
work, we employ the recently proposed theory for general hyperbolic relaxation
systems to validate relaxation models in numerical schemes of
hyperbolic-parabolic systems. By verifying the convergence criteria, we
demonstrate the convergence, and thereby the approximation validity, of five
representative relaxation models, providing a solid basis for the effectiveness
of the corresponding numerical schemes. Moreover, we propose a new relaxation
model for the general multi-dimensional hyperbolic-parabolic system. With some
mild assumptions on the system, we show that the proposed model satisfies the
convergence criteria. We remark that the existing relaxation models are
constructed only for a special case of hyperbolic-parabolic system, while our
new relaxation model is valid for general systems.

Conclusion: ML-VMS方法成功整合了多级网格策略和变分多尺度框架，提供了灵活的多尺度计算能力，显著提升了大规模问题的计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the MultiLevel Variational MultiScale (ML-VMS)
method, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates a multilevel mesh strategy
into the Variational Multiscale (VMS) framework. A key feature of the ML-VMS
method is the use of the Convolutional Hierarchical Deep Neural Network
(C-HiDeNN) as the approximation basis. The framework employs a coarse mesh
throughout the domain, with localized fine meshes placed only in subdomains of
high interest, such as those surrounding a source. Solutions at different
resolutions are robustly coupled through the variational weak form and
interface conditions. Compared to existing multilevel methods, ML-VMS (1) can
couple an arbitrary number of mesh levels across different scales using
variational multiscale framework; (2) allows approximating functions with
arbitrary orders with linear finite element mesh due to the C-HiDeNN basis; (3)
is supported by a rigorous theoretical error analysis; (4) features several
tunable hyperparameters (e.g., order $p$, patch size $s$) with a systematic
guide for their selection. We first show the theoretical error estimates of
ML-VMS. Then through numerical examples, we demonstrate that ML-VMS with the
C-HiDeNN takes less computational time than the FEM basis given comparable
accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate a space-time reduced-order model (ROM)
based on C-HiDeNN-Tensor Decomposition (TD) into the ML-VMS framework. For a
large-scale single-track laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) transient heat transfer
problem that is equivalent to a full-order finite element model with $10^{10}$
spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), our 3-level ML-VMS C-HiDeNN-TD achieves an
approximately 5,000x speedup on a single CPU over a single-level linear FEM-TD
ROM.

of multivariate measures by discrete signed measures. The method is based on
the availability of an orthonormal basis and a low-cardinality algebraic
quadrature formula for an auxiliary measure in a bounding set. Differently from
other approaches, no conditioning issue arises since no matrix factorization or
inversion is needed. We provide bounds for the sum of the absolute values of
the signed measure weights, and we make two examples: efficient quadrature on
curved planar elements with spline boundary (in view of the application to
high-order FEM/VEM), and compression of QMC integration on 3D elements with
complex shape.

### [444] [Perturbation Function Iteration Method: A New Framework for Solving Periodic Solutions of Non-linear and Non-smooth Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23071)
*Limin Cao,Yanmao Chen,Li Wang,Loic Salles,Zechang Zheng*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扰动理论的扰动函数迭代方法(PFIM)，用于计算强非线性或非光滑振动系统的周期响应，相比传统方法在计算效率和鲁棒性方面有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数值方法(如谐波平衡法和打靶法)在复杂高维或非光滑系统中存在局限性，特别是雅可比矩阵构建困难且计算成本高，需要新的高效计算方法。

Method: PFIM将非线性方程转化为时变线性系统，通过分段常数近似方案求解周期响应，采用无基底的迭代公式避免傅里叶截断误差和吉布斯现象。

Result: 数值研究表明PFIM在光滑系统中实现二次收敛，在高度非光滑情况下保持稳健的线性收敛，对高维非光滑系统的计算成本比HBM低两个数量级。

Conclusion: PFIM为复杂非线性动力系统的周期响应分析提供了鲁棒高效的替代方法，具有实际工程应用的强大潜力。

Abstract: Computing accurate periodic responses in strongly nonlinear or even
non-smooth vibration systems remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear
dynamics. Existing numerical methods, such as the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM)
and the Shooting Method (SM), have achieved notable success but face intrinsic
limitations when applied to complex, high-dimensional, or non-smooth systems. A
key bottleneck is the construction of Jacobian matrices for the associated
algebraic equations; although numerical approximations can avoid explicit
analytical derivation, they become unreliable and computationally expensive for
large-scale or non-smooth problems. To overcome these challenges, this study
proposes the Perturbation Function Iteration Method (PFIM), a novel framework
built upon perturbation theory. PFIM transforms nonlinear equations into
time-varying linear systems and solves their periodic responses via a piecewise
constant approximation scheme. Unlike HBM, PFIM avoids the trade-off between
Fourier truncation errors and the Gibbs phenomenon in non-smooth problems by
employing a basis-free iterative formulation, while significantly simplifying
the Jacobian computation. Extensive numerical studies, including self-excited
systems, parameter continuation, systems with varying smoothness, and
high-dimensional finite element models, demonstrate that PFIM achieves
quadratic convergence in smooth systems and maintains robust linear convergence
in highly non-smooth cases. Moreover, comparative analyses show that, for
high-dimensional non-smooth systems, PFIM attains solutions of comparable
accuracy with computational costs up to two orders of magnitude lower than HBM.
These results indicate that PFIM provides a robust and efficient alternative
for periodic response analysis in complex nonlinear dynamical systems, with
strong potential for practical engineering applications.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于求解高对比度Signorini型接触问题的迭代多尺度框架，结合了约束能量最小化广义多尺度有限元方法和基于半光滑牛顿法的原始-对偶主动集策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高对比度异质材料中接触问题的多尺度建模挑战，传统方法难以有效捕捉接触边界附近的精细尺度特征。

Method: 使用局部谱问题构建辅助多尺度空间，在过采样域上推导能量最小化多尺度基函数，并在主动集演化过程中仅更新接触边界处的多尺度基。

Result: 数值实验表明该方法在高对比度异质介质中具有鲁棒性和高效性，能够准确捕捉接触边界附近的精细尺度特征。

Conclusion: 所提出的迭代多尺度框架为高对比度接触问题提供了对比度鲁棒的高效数值解法，并建立了误差估计和有限步收敛性的理论保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel iterative multiscale framework for solving
high-contrast contact problems of Signorini type. The method integrates the
constrained energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method
(CEM-GMsFEM) with a primal-dual active set strategy derived from semismooth
Newton methods. First, local spectral problems are employed to construct an
auxiliary multiscale space, from which energy minimizing multiscale basis
functions are derived on oversampled domains, yielding a contrast-robust
reduced-order approximation of the underlying partial differential equation.
The multiscale bases are updated iteratively, but only at contact boundary,
during the active set evolution process. Rigorous analysis is provided to
establish error estimates and finite step convergence of the iterative scheme.
Numerical experiments on heterogeneous media with high-contrast coefficients
demonstrate that the proposed approach is both robust and efficient in
capturing fine-scale features near contact boundaries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法如动态模态分解仅近似Koopman算子，缺乏与微分算子的明确联系，需要建立可解释的算子学习方法。

Method: 使用Chebyshev基函数将动力学投影到有限维Koopman矩阵，捕捉微分和非线性项，构建Koopman算子与微分算子的数值联系。

Result: 在基准动力系统上的数值实验验证了方法的准确性和效率，展示了可解释算子学习的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来与符号回归集成奠定了基础，能够直接从数据构建显式数学模型。

Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed for identifying partial differential
equations (PDEs) governing dynamical systems directly from their observation
data using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In contrast to data-driven
approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which approximate the
Koopman operator without a clear connection to differential operators, the
proposed method constructs finite-dimensional Koopman matrices by projecting
the dynamics onto a Chebyshev basis, thereby capturing both differential and
nonlinear terms. This establishes a numerical link between the Koopman and
differential operators. Numerical experiments on benchmark dynamical systems
confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, underscoring its potential
for interpretable operator learning. The framework also lays a foundation for
future integration with symbolic regression, enabling the construction of
explicit mathematical models directly from data.

Motivation: 准确高效地计算Floquet乘子和子空间对于分析动力系统中的极限环和射频仿真中的周期性稳态至关重要。现有方法中，后向欧拉法计算成本低但精度有限，而一步配置法精度高但计算成本大，特别是在大规模稀疏情况下。

Method: 应用多步方法推导周期性多项式特征值问题，引入额外的虚假特征值。在温和的光滑性假设下，证明随着步长减小，计算的Floquet乘子和相关不变子空间以更高阶收敛，而虚假特征值收敛到零。提出pTOAR算法用于高效求解大规模问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，多步方法实现了高阶精度，同时其计算和内存成本仅略高于后向欧拉方法。

Conclusion: 多步方法在保持高精度的同时，计算效率接近后向欧拉法，为大规模Floquet分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient computation of Floquet multipliers and subspaces is
essential for analyzing limit cycle in dynamical systems and periodic steady
state in Radio Frequency (RF) simulation. This problem is typically addressed
by solving a periodic linear eigenvalue problem, which is discretized from the
linear periodic time-varying system using one-step methods. The backward Euler
method offers a computationally inexpensive overall workflow but has limited
accuracy. In contrast, one-step collocation methods achieve higher accuracy
through over-sampling, explicit matrix construction, and condensation, thus
become costly for large-scale sparse cases. We apply multistep methods to
derive a periodic polynomial eigenvalue problem, which introduces additional
spurious eigenvalues. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we prove that as the
stepsize decreases, the computed Floquet multipliers and their associated
invariant subspace converge with higher order, while the spurious eigenvalues
converge to zero. To efficiently solve large-scale problems, we propose pTOAR,
a memory-efficient iterative algorithm for computing the dominant Floquet
eigenpairs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that multistep methods achieves
high order accuracy, while its computational and memory costs are only
marginally higher than those of the backward Euler method.

Abstract: We propose a new deep learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional
parabolic integro-differential equations (PIDEs) and forward-backward
stochastic differential equations with jumps (FBSDEJs). This novel algorithm
can be viewed as an extension and generalization of the DBDP2 scheme and a
dynamic programming version of the forward-backward algorithm proposed recently
for high-dimensional semilinear PDEs and semilinear PIDEs, respectively.
Different from the DBDP2 scheme for semilinear PDEs, our algorithm approximate
simultaneously the solution and the integral kernel by deep neural networks,
while the gradient of the solution is approximated by numerical differential
techniques. The related error estimates for the integral kernel approximation
play key roles in deriving error estimates for the novel algorithm. Numerical
experiments confirm our theoretical results and verify the effectiveness of the
proposed methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for mathematical modelling of surfaces
conditioned on empirical data. It is based on solving a discrete biharmonic
equation over a domain with given inner point and inner curve data. The inner
curve data is used to model boundary values while the inner point data is used
for modeling a load vector with the goal to generate a smooth surface. The
construction of boundary data is an ill-posed problem, for which a special
regularization approach is suggested.
  The method is designed for surface construction problems with a very limited
amount of measured data. In the paper we apply the method by using empirical
data of soil thickness and geological maps indicating exposed bedrock regions.

Motivation: 标准SPDE的Euler格式由于噪声的时间正则性低，收敛阶被限制在1/2到1之间，需要开发更高阶的数值格式。

Abstract: We present high-order numerical schemes for linear stochastic heat and wave
equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions, driven by additive noise.
Standard Euler schemes for SPDEs are limited to an order convergence between
1/2 and 1 due to the low temporal regularity of noise. For the stochastic heat
equation, a modified Crank-Nicolson scheme with proper numerical quadrature
rule for the noise term in its reformulation as random PDE achieves a strong
convergence rate of 3/2. For the stochastic wave equation with additive noise a
corresponding approach leads to a scheme which is of order 2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究表明使用连续自适应测量可以从R^m中恢复向量，且仅需O(log m)次测量，但在噪声存在的情况下，这种连续测量相对于线性测量的潜在增益受到限制。

Method: 使用熵数来刻画在确定性噪声干扰下最优（非）连续信息的质量。

Result: 在噪声存在的情况下，连续测量相对于线性测量的潜在增益是有限的，但在某些情况下仍然显著。

Conclusion: 噪声限制了连续测量相对于线性测量的优势，但在特定情况下，连续测量仍能带来显著的信息恢复质量提升。

Abstract: It is impossible to recover a vector from $\mathbb{R}^m$ with less than $m$
linear measurements, even if the measurements are chosen adaptively. Recently,
it has been shown that one can recover vectors from $\mathbb{R}^m$ with
arbitrary precision using only $O(\log m)$ continuous (even Lipschitz) adaptive
measurements, resulting in an exponential speed-up of continuous information
compared to linear information for various approximation problems. In this
note, we characterize the quality of optimal (dis-)continuous information that
is disturbed by deterministic noise in terms of entropy numbers. This shows
that in the presence of noise the potential gain of continuous over linear
measurements is limited, but significant in some cases.

Conclusion: 移位边界多项式修正与高阶间断伽辽金方法结合时，隐式时间积分是实现无条件稳定嵌入式边界处理的关键，而显式方法在高阶情况下存在稳定性限制。

Abstract: Embedded, or immersed, approaches have the goal of reducing to the minimum
the computational costs associated with the generation of body-fitted meshes by
only employing fixed, possibly Cartesian, meshes over which complex boundaries
can move freely. However, this boundary treatment introduces a geometrical
error of the order of the mesh size that, if not treated properly, can spoil
the global accuracy of a high order discretization, herein based on
discontinuous Galerkin. The shifted boundary polynomial correction was proposed
as a simplified version of the shifted boundary method, which is an embedded
boundary treatment based on Taylor expansions to deal with unfitted boundaries.
It is used to accordingly correct the boundary conditions imposed on a
non-meshed boundary to compensate the aforementioned geometrical error, and
reach high order accuracy. In this paper, the stability analysis of
discontinuous Galerkin methods coupled with the shifted boundary polynomial
correction is conducted in depth for the linear advection equation, by
visualizing the eigenvalue spectrum of the high order discretized operators.
The analysis considers a simplified one-dimensional setting by varying the
degree of the polynomials and the distance between the real boundary and the
closest mesh interface. The main result of the analysis shows that the
considered high order embedded boundary treatment introduces a limitation to
the stability region of high order discontinuous Galerkin methods with explicit
time integration, which becomes more and more important when using higher order
methods. The implicit time integration is also studied, showing that the
implicit treatment of the boundary condition allows one to overcome such
limitation and achieve an unconditionally stable high order embedded boundary
treatment.

Abstract: We consider a Navier--Stokes--Allen--Cahn (NSAC) system that governs the
compressible motion of a viscous, immiscible two-phase fluid at constant
temperature. Weak solutions of the NSAC system dissipate an appropriate energy
functional. Based on an equivalent re-formulation of the NSAC system we propose
a fully-discrete discontinuous Galerkin (dG) discretization that is
mass-conservative, energy-stable, and provides higher-order accuracy in space
and second-order accuracy in time. The approach relies on the approach in
\cite{Giesselmann2015a} and a special splitting discretization of the
derivatives of the free energy function within the Crank-Nicolson
time-stepping. Numerical experiments confirm the analytical statements and show
the applicability of the approach.

treatment of dual norms through the construction of suitable test spaces, and
iterative solutions. Numerical experiments are used to validate our theoretical
findings.

Abstract: Based on the Stokes complex with vanishing boundary conditions and its dual
complex, we reinterpret a grad-curl problem arising from the quad-curl problem
as a new vector potential formulation of the three-dimensional Stokes system.
By extending the analysis to the corresponding non-homogeneous problems and the
accompanying trace complex, we construct a novel
$\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{grad-curl})$-conforming virtual element space
with arbitrary approximation order that satisfies the exactness of the
associated discrete Stokes complex. In the lowest-order case, three degrees of
freedom are assigned to each vertex and one to each edge. For the grad-curl
problem, we rigorously establish the interpolation error estimates, the
stability of discrete bilinear forms, and the convergence of the proposed
element on polyhedral meshes. As a discrete vector potential formulation of the
Stokes problem, the resulting system is pressure-decoupled and symmetric
positive definite. Some numerical examples are presented to verify the
theoretical results.

Abstract: Finite volume methods are prevalent in reservoir simulation due to their mass
conservation properties and their ability to handle complex grids. However, a
simple and consistent finite volume method for elasticity was unavailable until
the recently developed two-point stress approximation finite volume method
(TPSA). In this work, we show how to couple TPSA to an established flow
simulator, using OPM Flow as our primary example. Due to this choice of
numerical methods, the coupling is naturally handled at the cell centers,
without requiring interpolation operators. We propose a fixed stress coupling
scheme and reuse algebraic multi-grid preconditioners, which are known to be
effective for two-point flux finite volume methods. Numerical examples
illustrate the flexibility of the approach and we showcase how the introduction
of solid mechanics impacts the behavior of compartmentalized flow systems.

Abstract: We consider moving boundary problems for biophysics and introduce a new
computational framework to handle the complexity of the bulk-surface PDEs. In
our framework, interpretability is maintained by adapting the fast,
generalizable and accurate structure preservation scheme in [Q. Cheng and J.
Shen, \textit{Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering}, 391

work of [B. Duan and B. Li, \textit{SIAM J. Sci. Comput.}, 46 (2024)], which is
tied to an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework. We test our
algorithms accuracy on moving surfaces with boundary for the following PDEs:
advection-diffusion-reaction equations, phase-field models of Cahn-Hilliard
type, and Helfrich energy gradient flows. We performed convergence studies for
all the schemes introduced to demonstrate accuracy. We use a staggered approach
to achieve coupling and further verify the convergence of this coupling using
numerical experiments. Finally, we demonstrate broad applicability of our work
by simulating state-of-the-art tests of biophysical models that involve
membrane deformation.

### [460] [A Feature Engineering Approach for Business Impact-Oriented Failure Detection in Distributed Instant Payment Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21710)
*Lorenzo Porcelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于ISO 20022消息交换处理时间的特征工程方法，用于即时支付系统的异常检测和故障定位，在TIPS系统上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控方法无法弥合技术基础设施指标与业务流程可见性之间的差距，即时支付系统需要零停机处理数百万交易。

Method: 基于连续ISO 20022消息交换的处理时间构建特征工程，创建系统状态的紧凑表示，并应用异常检测技术。

Result: 在TIPS系统上的实验评估表明，该方法能有效检测多种异常模式，提供可解释的解释，区分内部和外部支付系统问题，显著减少调查时间。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将特征映射到不同处理阶段，弥合了分布式系统中交易状态分散在多个实体间的可观测性差距。

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

### [461] [Numerical Fragility in Transformers: A Layer-wise Theory for Explaining, Forecasting, and Mitigating Instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21770)
*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个一阶模块化理论来分析Transformer在低精度训练中的前向误差放大问题，推导了自注意力层的稳定性边界，并开发了可操作的诊断指标来预测和缓解不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低精度训练的Transformer存在前向误差放大问题，需要理论工具来理解和预测这种不稳定性，以便开发有效的缓解策略。

Method: 开发了一阶模块化理论，推导了自注意力层的稳定性边界，包括三个可解释的诊断指标：分数尺度比、行向softmax敏感度和值条件数，以及残差松弛不等式和LayerNorm指标。

Result: 在Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10上的实验表明，组合预测器能准确跟踪FP32与低精度之间的不匹配，κ_softmax的时间序列最大值可作为提前预警信号，基于ρ_LN的微小调整能有效稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该理论提供了可操作的、无量纲的诊断指标，能够解释自注意力的脆弱性、预测不稳定性，并指导最小侵入性的缓解措施。

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

### [462] [Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR): Condition-Number Control with Moment Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21772)
*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)方法，通过直接优化层谱来改善深度网络的训练稳定性，显著降低条件数并提高测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络训练中，层谱条件数过大会导致梯度不稳定和训练困难，需要一种架构无关的方法来直接控制谱特性。

Method: 使用CMR损失函数，通过log-condition代理联合控制谱边界，并通过Chebyshev矩塑造内部谱分布，采用解耦、有上限的混合规则来保持任务梯度。

Result: 在对抗性κ-stress设置中，相比普通训练，CMR在5个epoch内将平均层条件数降低约1000倍（从约3900降至约3.4），增加平均梯度幅度，并将测试精度从约10%恢复至约86%。

Conclusion: 支持优化驱动的谱预调节方法，直接引导模型进入良好条件状态，实现稳定准确的学习。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models
toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.

### [463] [What Causes Postoperative Aspiration?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21779)
*Supriya Nagesh,Karina Covarrubias,Robert El-Kareh,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan,Nina Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发机器学习模型预测术后误吸风险，识别关键预测因子包括阿片类药物剂量、住院时间和年龄，发现性别差异在误吸风险和用药剂量方面存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误吸（异物吸入肺部）严重影响手术患者的发病率和死亡率，需要开发预测模型以便及时采取预防性干预措施。

Method: 从MIMIC-IV数据库中识别826名术后误吸患者和匹配的非误吸队列，使用XGBoost、多层感知机和随机森林三种机器学习模型，并采用增强逆概率加权进行因果分析。

Result: 机器学习模型在测试集上AUROC达到0.86，敏感性77.3%。最大日阿片类药物剂量、住院时间和患者年龄是最重要的预测因子。因果分析显示阿片类药物和手术部位（颈部、头部）是显著致病因素。男性误吸风险是女性的1.5倍，且接受的阿片类药物剂量高出27%。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能有效预测术后误吸风险，阿片类药物剂量和手术部位显著影响误吸风险。性别差异在用药和误吸率方面值得进一步研究，这些发现对改进术后护理方案和误吸预防策略具有重要意义。

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

### [464] [Online Mixture of Experts: No-Regret Learning for Optimal Collective Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21788)
*Larkin Liu,Jalal Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种在线专家混合(OMoE)算法，结合专家委员会进行聚合决策，应用于大语言模型的在线微调，实现了无遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在上下文环境中，通过专家委员会聚合输出以获得最优的聚合准确性，特别是在大语言模型在线微调场景中。

Method: 1. 结合聚合投票与UCB驱动的连续消除算法，高效剪枝次优探索动作；2. 使用在线加权多数投票机制，根据专家的预测能力分配投票权重。

Result: 在理想情况下推导了bandit设置中的遗憾理论保证，并提供了相应的实证结果。

Conclusion: 这些方法为结合多个专家以提升聚合模型整体性能提供了新的方法论和无遗憾保证。

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

### [465] [Variance-Reduction Guidance: Sampling Trajectory Optimization for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21792)
*Shifeng Xu,Yanzhu Liu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Variance-Reduction Guidance (VRG)方法，通过统计测量预测误差并寻找新的采样轨迹来提升扩散模型生成质量，无需模型微调或修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中存在预测误差，这种误差会随着采样步骤累积并降低生成质量，需要一种方法来缓解这一问题。

Method: VRG方法统计测量预测误差，在给定预定义采样轨迹的情况下，寻找具有相同采样步数但能产生更高质量结果的新轨迹。

Result: 在多个数据集和基线模型上的实验表明，VRG能显著提高扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: VRG是一种有效的技术，能够在不修改模型的情况下减少预测误差累积，提升扩散模型的生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

### [466] [A Physics-Guided AI Cascaded Corrector Model Significantly Extends Madden-Julian Oscillation Prediction Skill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21796)
*Xiao Zhou,Yuze Sun,Jie Wu,Xiaomeng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PCC-MJO深度学习框架作为通用后处理器，纠正动力模型对MJO的预报，可将有效预报期延长2-8天，有效缓解了"海洋大陆障碍"问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是全球天气和气候极端事件的重要驱动因子，但在业务动力模型中的预报仍然具有挑战性，有效预报通常仅限于3-4周。

Method: 两阶段模型：首先使用物理信息3D U-Net纠正时空场误差，然后使用针对预报技能优化的LSTM精炼MJO的RMM指数。

Result: 应用于CMA、ECMWF和NCEP三个不同业务预报时，统一框架将有效预报范围（双变量相关>0.5）持续延长2-8天，有效缓解了"海洋大陆障碍"。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条物理一致、计算高效且高度可推广的途径，突破了次季节预报中长期存在的障碍。

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

*Zhaocheng Liu,Zhiwen Yu,Xiaoqing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态不平衡的定量分析方法，通过定义模态间隙并使用双峰高斯混合模型识别平衡与不平衡样本，进而设计自适应损失函数来改善多模态学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流方法主要关注架构修改和优化，而忽视了对模态间不平衡程度的定量分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供对多模态不平衡的定量理解。

Method: 定义模态间隙作为不同模态对真实类别预测的Softmax分数差异，使用双峰高斯混合模型分析其分布，识别平衡与不平衡样本，并基于此设计自适应损失函数，采用两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在CREMA-D和AVE数据集上分别达到80.65%和70.90%的准确率，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的定量分析方法和自适应损失函数有效改善了多模态不平衡问题，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

### [468] [MARS-M: When Variance Reduction Meets Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21800)
*Yifeng Liu,Angela Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARS-M是一种结合了矩阵预条件优化器Muon和方差缩减技术MARS的新优化器，在LLM训练中实现了更快的收敛速度和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩阵预条件优化器（如Muon）在大规模神经网络训练中比标量优化器更高效，而方差缩减技术（如MARS）在LLM预训练中能显著加速。为了结合两者的优势，开发了MARS-M优化器。

Method: 将MARS中的方差缩减技术与Muon优化器相结合，创建了MARS-M优化器。在标准正则条件下，证明了其收敛性。

Result: 理论证明MARS-M以$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$的速率收敛到一阶驻点，优于Muon的$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$速率。实验结果显示在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中，MARS-M能持续获得更低的损失和更好的下游任务性能。

Conclusion: MARS-M成功结合了矩阵预条件和方差缩减技术的优势，在理论和实验上都表现出优于现有方法的性能，为大规模神经网络训练提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at
https://github.com/AGI-Arena/MARS/MARS_M.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XRePIT是一种新型混合仿真策略，结合机器学习加速与基于求解器的校正，实现了稳定、自动化的流体动力学仿真，在10000+时间步长下保持稳定，速度提升达4.98倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯数据驱动的流体动力学代理模型容易因误差累积而失败，而现有混合方法缺乏自动化和鲁棒性，无法实际应用。

Method: 开发了XRePIT混合仿真策略，将机器学习加速与求解器校正相结合，设计为全自动和物理感知的方法。

Result: 实现了首个稳定的加速仿真，超过10000个时间步长，对未见边界条件具有鲁棒性，可扩展到3D流动，速度提升达4.98倍，热场相对误差约1E-3，速度动态误差低于1E-2 ms-1。

Conclusion: 建立了一个成熟且可扩展的混合方法，为实际工程应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus
establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in
real-world engineering.

### [470] [Geographic Transferability of Machine Learning Models for Short-Term Airport Fog Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21819)
*Marcelo Cerda Castillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于物理过程的无坐标特征集，用于机场雾的短期预测，实现了跨地理位置的零样本迁移预测，在相距11,650公里的不同机场都取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机场雾预测模型在地理泛化方面的挑战，因为传统机器学习模型依赖位置特定特征，难以在不同地点间迁移。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类器(XGBoost)，基于智利圣地亚哥(SCEL)2002-2009年的数据训练，采用编码基本热力学和辐射过程的无坐标特征集，在多个机场进行零样本测试。

Result: 模型在相距11,650公里的不同机场(智利、美国、英国)都取得了0.923-0.947的AUC值，能适应不同类型的雾(辐射雾、平流雾、海雾)。

Conclusion: 基于物理信息的无坐标特征工程可以开发出具有地理迁移性的大气预报工具，模型学习到了可迁移的物理关系而非站点特定模式。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HAIN的分层注意力可解释网络，该网络结合了多级注意力机制、降维和解释驱动的损失函数，用于复杂生物医学数据的可解释分析。在TCGA数据集上实现了94.3%的分类准确率，超越了SHAP和LIME等传统后解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集在基因组学、医疗保健和金融等领域的激增，迫切需要既准确又可解释的机器学习模型。传统深度学习方法虽然预测性能强，但缺乏透明度，阻碍了在关键决策敏感应用中的部署。

Method: HAIN架构统一了多级注意力机制、维度约简和解释驱动的损失函数。通过梯度加权注意力提供特征级可解释性，并通过基于原型的表示提供全局模型解释。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上的综合评估显示，HAIN实现了94.3%的分类准确率，在透明度和解释能力方面都超越了SHAP和LIME等传统后解释方法。HAIN有效识别了生物学相关的癌症生物标志物。

Conclusion: 通过协调预测准确性和可解释性，HAIN推进了精准医学和监管合规的透明AI解决方案的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)与动态时间规整(DTW)在时间序列相似性度量中的性能，发现MDD在多尺度分析和避免点对点对齐方面具有优势，在多个场景下显著优于DTW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列是高维复杂数据对象，其高效搜索和索引一直是数据挖掘领域的长期挑战。本文旨在探索新型相似性度量MDD相对于广泛使用的DTW的比较优势和局限性。

Method: 使用MDD和DTW两种方法进行对比分析，MDD通过多尺度时间序列评估和避免点对点对齐来实现相似性度量。通过模拟实验和UCR档案中的95个数据集测试假设，并在真实世界分类任务中应用两种方法。

Result: 研究表明，在许多场景中MDD显著优于DTW，性能提升幅度很大。论文详细分析了MDD解决的具体性能差距，并在真实世界分类任务中证实了MDD相对于DTW的显著改进。

Conclusion: MDD作为一种新型时间序列相似性度量方法，在多尺度分析和避免点对点对齐方面具有独特优势，在实际应用中表现出比DTW更好的性能，具有重要的实用价值。

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界代码编辑场景中，奖励分布通常偏斜且包含不可预测的异常值，导致GRPO等基于组相对方法在优势计算时出现失真和噪声增加。

Method: GAPO为每个提示自适应寻找无异常值的高密度区间，使用该区间中位数作为自适应Q值替代组均值进行优势计算，保持即插即用和高效率。

Result: 在9个指令调优LLM（3B-14B）和包含51,844个真实世界代码编辑任务的大规模内部数据集上验证，GAPO在精确匹配准确率上相比GRPO及其变体DAPO取得一致改进。

Conclusion: GAPO能鲁棒处理偏斜分布，在代码编辑的强化学习后训练中提供更稳定的性能提升，且代码已公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出RestoreLCC方法，通过激活编辑对比探测关键注意力头，提取丢失组件并注入回剪枝后的头部，以恢复剪枝LLM的性能而保持稀疏性和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法为密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的特性，导致恢复效果不佳。剪枝引起的信息损失反映在注意力激活中，选择性重新引入这些信息可显著恢复模型性能。

Method: RestoreLCC通过对比激活编辑探测关键注意力头，从激活差异中提取丢失组件，然后将其注入回对应剪枝头部进行补偿。该方法兼容结构化、半结构化和非结构化剪枝方案。

Result: 广泛实验表明，RestoreLCC在通用和任务特定性能恢复方面持续优于最先进基线方法，且不损害剪枝模型的稀疏性或推理效率。

Conclusion: RestoreLCC是一种即插即用的剪枝模型恢复方法，通过丢失组件补偿有效恢复性能，同时保持剪枝带来的低成本和高效率优势。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个端到端的多任务系统，通过单一图像生成事实准确的商品描述。采用多任务学习微调视觉编码器，并结合分层生成过程来减少事实幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成商品描述和名称对零售商来说劳动密集且耗时。现有视觉语言模型存在事实幻觉问题，且单任务模型无法捕捉特征间的相互依赖关系。

Method: 1. 多任务学习：单一视觉主干网络联合训练属性预测（颜色、下摆、领型）和价格回归；2. 分层生成过程：将模型预测的属性嵌入提示中，输入文本解码器以提高事实一致性。

Result: 多任务方法在价格回归上R2值提高3.6%，属性分类F1分数提高6.6%。分层生成过程将事实幻觉率从12.7%降至7.1%（相对减少44.5%），生成延迟减少3.5倍，但ROUGE-L得分比直接视觉语言模型低3.5%。

Conclusion: 该架构在多任务学习和分层生成方面表现出优越性，显著减少了事实幻觉并提高了效率，为自动化商品描述生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型持续学习面临灾难性遗忘问题，且频繁重新训练成本高昂，需要一种高效的方法来学习新任务而不遗忘旧知识

Method: 使用自编码器学习任务权重的低维嵌入表示，促进知识迁移到新任务，同时防止灾难性遗忘

Conclusion: COLA框架使大语言模型能够高效学习新任务，对先前任务性能影响极小，且无需保留早期训练数据

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可微分框架，将离散经验插值方法(DEIM)用于可解释深度学习和动力系统分析，既改进了传统DEIM的局限性，又将其作为诊断工具分析神经微分方程模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DEIM在投影降阶模型中高效近似非线性项，但其固定插值点难以适应复杂时变动力学。需要开发自适应DEIM来提升灵活性，并探索DEIM作为分析工具理解神经微分方程模型的能力。

Method: 开发了可微分自适应DEIM公式，让神经网络动态选择插值点；将DEIM作为分析工具应用于预训练神经常微分方程(NODE)，分析其学习到的动力学特征。

Result: 在一维粘性Burgers方程中实现了计算高效且物理一致的自适应插值点选择；在二维涡旋合并问题中，DEIM轨迹揭示了NODE学习到的物理意义特征，并暴露了其在未见流配置下的外推局限性。

Conclusion: DEIM不仅可作为模型降阶工具，还能作为诊断框架来理解和改进神经微分方程模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

TL;DR: KARIPAP是一种量子启发的张量网络压缩方法，使用无限投影纠缠对态(iPEPS)和张量重整化群(TRG)来压缩大型语言模型，显著减少内存和参数，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的巨大参数规模带来了严重的计算和环境负担，现有的压缩方法忽略了复杂的层间相关性。

Method: 使用iPEPS捕获注意力机制和深层transformer层中的多方向纠缠，通过TRG实现多项式时间收缩，进行张量化压缩。

Result: 在LLaMA-2 7B上实现93%内存和70%参数减少，训练速度提升50%，推理速度提升25%，准确率仅损失2-3%。

Conclusion: 现代LLM占据低维纠缠流形，KARIPAP展示了可扩展、节能且量子感知的AI架构的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

Conclusion: GP-MIA为现有成员推理攻击提供了实用的替代方案，具有高效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a
model's training set, posing serious privacy risks. Existing methods often
depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian
process (GP) meta-modeling. Using post-hoc metrics such as accuracy, entropy,
dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SynCast方法，首次将偏好优化引入降水临近预报，通过两阶段后训练框架解决确定性模型过度平滑和概率模型性能波动的问题，协同优化冲突的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报面临确定性模型预测过度平滑、难以捕捉极端事件，以及概率生成模型性能波动的问题。同时，多个评估指标之间存在冲突（如CSI和FAR），现有模型难以同时优化这些指标。

Method: 提出SynCast方法，采用Diffusion-SPO两阶段后训练框架：第一阶段专注于降低FAR，训练模型有效抑制误报；第二阶段在保持FAR对齐约束下进一步优化CSI，实现冲突指标的协同改进。

Result: 该方法能够渐进地对齐冲突指标，持续实现优越性能，在降水临近预报中取得协同改进。

Conclusion: 偏好优化方法能够有效解决降水临近预报中评估指标冲突的问题，为极端天气监测和灾害预防提供更可靠的预测支持。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at

<details>

Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否真的具备反思推理能力，测试在无外部反馈的递归自我评估中是否会出现信息停滞现象。

Method: 跨提供商研究，使用三种模型（GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3 Haiku、Gemini 2.0 Flash）在四种任务类型上进行十次迭代，比较无基础自我批判和最小验证干预两种条件。

Result: 无基础运行中信息变化下降55%，验证干预后立即反弹28%并维持非零方差。所有模型都表现出相同模式：无接触反思趋向信息封闭。

Conclusion: 生成式推理中的自我校正存在结构限制，无独立验证的递归推理会趋向认知停滞状态。最小验证作为耗散耦合能重新引入信息流。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性训练方法难以防御新型越狱攻击，因为存在优化挑战和威胁模型定义困难。作者假设新型越狱攻击本质上是已有对抗技能的重组。

Method: 通过分析32篇攻击论文，提取并压缩对抗技能为稀疏基元字典，然后提出ASCoT方法，在技能基元的多样化组合上进行训练。

Result: ASCoT显著提高了对未见攻击（包括多轮越狱）的鲁棒性，同时保持了较低的过度拒绝率。研究表明扩展对抗技能覆盖范围比单纯增加数据规模更重要。

Conclusion: 对抗性技能组合训练是防御新型越狱攻击的有效方法，验证了对抗性似曾相识假说，即新型攻击主要是已有技能的重组。

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

Conclusion: 该框架支持符号限制、稀疏性和对现有工具的最小修改等治理约束，确保在临床工作流程中的实际可部署性

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

TL;DR: 本文研究了神经网络中的瓶颈秩现象及其对泛化能力的影响，提出了基于权重矩阵Schatten p拟范数的泛化界，揭示了低秩结构如何改善神经网络的样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现神经网络在梯度训练中表现出瓶颈秩特性：随着深度增加，激活和权重矩阵趋于近似低秩。本文旨在探索这一现象对神经网络泛化能力的影响。

Method: 通过分析神经网络权重矩阵的Schatten p拟范数，建立泛化界理论框架，将权重矩阵的秩结构纳入泛化分析中。

Result: 推导出基于权重矩阵Schatten p拟范数的泛化界，当p较小时，样本复杂度为O(WrL²)，其中W为网络宽度，L为深度，r为权重矩阵秩；随着p增大，泛化界更接近基于范数的界。

Conclusion: 神经网络的低秩结构特性可以显著改善泛化性能，特别是在小p值情况下，样本复杂度与权重矩阵秩r线性相关，这为理解神经网络泛化能力提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

Conclusion: 提出的优化线性注意力方法在保持表达能力的同时，显著提升了计算效率和内存使用效率。

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: PUNT是一种模型无关的采样器，通过识别令牌依赖关系并移除冲突组中的低置信度令牌，在保持并行采样的同时平衡条件独立性和高置信度预测的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型(MDMs)相比自回归模型(ARMs)具有并行采样的优势，但并行采样面临条件独立性和高置信度预测之间的冲突：高置信度预测往往相互依赖，难以同时更新。

Method: 提出PUNT采样器，通过近似条件独立性测试识别令牌依赖关系，移除冲突组中的低置信度令牌，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的解掩码索引集。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中，PUNT比基线方法（包括顺序生成）准确率提高高达16%，尤其在生成长序列时表现更优，且对超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: PUNT在准确性和计算效率之间实现了优越的权衡，并诱导出层次化生成策略，模型先建立高级段落结构再进行局部细化，表现出类似规划的生成过程。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Motivation: 传统Jump Gaussian Processes在高维输入空间中存在局限性，需要开发能够有效处理高维分段连续函数的方法。

Method: DJGP在JGP基础上添加局部线性投影层，使用区域特定矩阵捕捉局部子空间结构，并在投影矩阵上放置高斯过程先验以控制模型复杂度。投影后的输入通过JGP建模来捕捉与响应的分段连续关系。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，DJGP相比现有方法具有更优越的预测准确性和更可靠的uncertainty量化。

Conclusion: DJGP通过两层的深度GP/JGP学习框架，成功解决了高维分段连续函数的建模问题，提供了更好的预测性能和不确定性估计。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: RECAP是一种端到端的方法，可直接应用于现有RLVR流程，无需额外模型训练或大量调参，有效解决了能力退化问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

Motivation: 传统的机器学习方法通常使用单一的最小自由能结构来表示分子，但这种方法无法充分反映热力学平衡状态下的低能构象集合。实验偏差（如PCR扩增或测序噪声）会掩盖真实的适配体-配体亲和力，导致观测丰度与实际结合强度不一致。

Result: 该方法在SELEX数据集上实现了稳健的社区检测和子图级解释，即使在存在观测偏差的情况下也能准确识别适配体-配体亲和力。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于识别低丰度的适配体候选物进行进一步实验评估，为存在实验偏差的生化数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

Result: 蒙特卡洛方法确实能够实现经验拼接，时序差分方法仅比蒙特卡洛方法略强，但两者差距远小于神经网络规模带来的影响。增加批评器容量能有效减少两种方法的泛化差距。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，传统时序差分方法的拼接归纳偏置可能不再那么必要，拼接能力可以通过模型规模而非专门算法来实现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该混合精度训练框架为神经ODE提供了一种可靠且高效的训练方案，解决了计算成本和内存需求的关键挑战，并通过开源PyTorch包rampde提供了易于使用的实现。

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统计框架来解决文本水印检测中因重复生成文本导致的伪随机性不完美问题，通过分层两区划和最小单元概念，改进了检测能力并确保严格的I型错误控制。

Motivation: 现有文本水印方法假设完美的伪随机性，但在实践中，生成文本的重复会导致结构化依赖，损害I型错误控制并使标准分析失效。

Method: 引入分层两区划统计框架，核心是最小单元概念——跨单元独立但单元内允许依赖的最小分组。基于最小单元定义非渐近效率度量，将水印检测建模为极小极大假设检验问题。

Result: 应用于Gumbel-max和逆变换水印时，框架产生闭式最优规则。理论和实验均证实检测能力提升且I型错误控制严格。

Conclusion: 该研究为不完美伪随机性下的水印检测提供了首个原则性基础，为模型输出的可靠追踪提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

Abstract: Computationally predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging
due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. DPEB is a
curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding
types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings),
contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and
sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are
available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure

this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.
Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest

Motivation: 选择合适的分类器评估指标对于模型比较和参数优化至关重要，但目前缺乏普遍接受的统一标准。同时，存在对缓解数据集不平衡的误解，而分类器优化的最终目标通常是最大化投资回报或最小化总分类成本。

Method: 定义了加权准确率（WA），这是一个与最小化总分类成本一致的二元分类器评估指标。提出了一个概念框架来处理成本敏感场景中的类别不平衡问题，并提供了一个在没有完全指定误分类成本时估计WA权重参数的程序。

Result: WA与总分类成本（TCC）在示例依赖场景中具有强相关性，证明了其鲁棒性。该框架允许在不同数据集间比较结果，并解决开发数据集与目标数据集之间的差异。

Conclusion: WA是一个直观且与成本最小化目标一致的分类器评估指标。该研究澄清了在成本敏感场景中处理类别不平衡的概念框架，并确定了在哪些情况下使用无成本感知的类别重平衡技术或重平衡指标与TCC最小化一致，以及在哪些情况下适得其反。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

Motivation: 现有RL工作假设公民会遵循政府制定的政策，但研究表明缺乏制度信任时公民不会遵循政策。本文旨在开发考虑制度信任的RL算法用于人道主义工程中的资源分配。

Method: 使用深度确定性策略梯度方法学习符合组织需求的资源分配策略，模拟资源分配过程并建模社区成员制度信任的变化，研究信任整合对结果的影响。

Result: 整合信任到RL算法能产生更成功的政策，特别是在组织目标不确定时；更保守的信任估计能提高公平性和平均社区信任，但会降低组织成功率；外部配额干预能在某些情况下改善公平和信任。

Conclusion: 制度信任在算法设计和实施中至关重要，但组织成功与社区福祉之间存在固有张力，需要在政策设计中平衡这两个目标。

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

Motivation: 解决神经网络架构选择对可解释性、效率和泛化性的影响，以及高斯过程在大规模问题中的计算瓶颈，同时改进KAN和KKAN的稳定性与性能。

Method: 基于KKAN架构，用Chebyshev层和MLP替换部分样条层，映射输入到高维空间，开发距离感知误差边界算法K-DAREK，反映测试点与训练点的邻近关系。

Result: K-DAREK比Ensemble of KANs快4倍、计算效率高10倍，比GP可扩展性高8.6倍，比DAREK安全性提高50%，在安全控制任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: K-DAREK通过距离感知误差边界和优化的KKAN架构，实现了高效、可解释的函数逼近与不确定性量化，为动态系统建模提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the

optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available

Conclusion: LOT建立了连接预测性能、可解释性和生成建模的统一框架，为理解高维生物系统中的免疫变异和治疗效果开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through

constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Motivation: 随着在线和虚拟学习的兴起，监控和提升学生参与度成为有效教育的重要方面。传统评估方法在虚拟环境中难以直接应用，需要开发自动化系统来检测在线学习中的学生参与水平。

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

Motivation: 图神经网络(GNNs)在图结构数据学习上具有高精度，但存在高计算和资源成本问题。神经网络压缩方法可用于减小模型大小同时保持合理精度。

Method: 使用三种剪枝方法和三种量化方法，在不同GNN模型上进行实验，包括图分类、节点分类和链接预测任务，在Cora、Proteins和BBBP三个图数据集上进行测试。

Conclusion: 剪枝和量化是有效的GNN压缩技术，非结构化剪枝特别有效，而量化方法的影响因数据集而异。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有函数对函数回归方法（如函数线性模型和神经算子）要么无法捕捉复杂非线性，要么在噪声、稀疏和不规则采样数据下缺乏可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 设计了一系列基于GP的线性和非线性变换，利用核的积分变换、GP插值和从GP采样的非线性激活函数。通过固定位置下的离散近似简化实现，并使用诱导点和白化变换进行变分学习。

Result: 在真实世界和PDE基准数据集上的实证结果表明，DGPFM在预测性能和不确定性校准方面具有优势。

Conclusion: DGPFM方法成功解决了函数对函数回归中的非线性建模和不确定性量化问题，为功能数据分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多动作RMABs的神经索引策略(NIP)，通过神经网络学习臂-动作对的预算感知索引，并使用可微背包层进行约束优化，实现端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RMABs假设二元动作和单一全局预算，但现实场景如医疗保健涉及多种干预措施和异构成本约束，需要更灵活的框架。

Method: 使用神经网络学习臂-动作对的索引，通过熵正则化最优传输问题构建可微背包层，将索引预测和约束优化统一在端到端可微框架中。

Result: NIP在严格执行异构预算约束的同时，实现了接近最优的性能(在oracle策略的5%以内)，并能扩展到数百个臂。

Conclusion: 为复杂资源受限环境中的索引策略学习建立了一个通用、理论基础扎实且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模在表示学习方面表现出强大能力，但在医学成像等挑战性领域直接应用有限：没有任务对齐的单纯生成无法为临床使用提供坚实基础。

Method: 采用条件多尺度归一化流架构，构建为可逆和可微分双射的层次结构，其中雅可比行列式在子变换间分解，支持精确似然计算和稳定优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估显示，MAGIC-Flow能够生成真实多样的样本并改进分类性能，有效处理扫描仪噪声和模态特定合成与识别。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Flow是数据有限领域中生成和分类的有效策略，对隐私保护增强、鲁棒泛化和可信赖医疗AI具有直接益处。

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

Method: 开发了可验证的代码修复管道，定义修复成功为构建验证通过，并通过固定依赖和禁用自动升级提高可复现性。使用简化管道进行大规模强化学习，在Qwen3-32B模型上进行监督微调，然后在简化环境中应用强化学习。

Result: 从GPT-4.1轨迹蒸馏的SFT模型性能相当但模型大小缩小56倍，RL在匹配的训练测试条件下带来7-20%的绝对增益。"思考模式"在实验中表现相当或更差。SFT和RL模型都无法跨环境泛化。

Conclusion: 训练和测试环境匹配对于构建可靠的现实世界代码修复代理至关重要，模型无法实现跨环境泛化。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

Motivation: 传统固定分辨率方法无法捕捉多尺度物理过程，而现有层次图神经网络在向下映射时会丢失全局趋势，削弱物理约束在预报中的作用。

Method: 设计了潜在记忆保留机制来保持全局趋势，以及潜在到物理分支来集成不同尺度的偏微分方程解场。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提高了天气预报的准确性和可靠性，还大幅降低了训练成本和碳足迹，对机器学习可持续发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in

Conclusion: 明确建模器官相互作用的时空依赖性能够实现更准确和可泛化的药物浓度预测，Dynamic GNN为传统PBPK公式提供了可扩展的无方程替代方案。

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

Conclusion: AniDS能够自适应地抑制沿键合方向的噪声，与物理化学原理一致，为3D分子预训练提供了更准确的去噪框架

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的隐式梯度手术方法能够有效解决机器遗忘中的效用保持问题，在计算效率和性能权衡方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

Motivation: NCO模型虽然性能优异，但其表示和决策原理仍是一个黑盒，这阻碍了学术研究和实际部署，需要更深入理解NCO模型的内部机制。

Method: 使用多种探测任务分析NCO模型表示，并引入新颖的CS-Probing工具来检查探测过程中的系数和统计显著性。

Result: 发现NCO模型编码了解决方案构建所需的低层信息，同时捕获了促进更好决策的高层知识。CS-Probing揭示了主流NCO模型对其学习表示施加了不同的归纳偏置，发现了与模型泛化相关的直接证据，并识别了与特定知识相关的关键嵌入维度。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了系统解释黑盒NCO模型的首次尝试，展示了探测作为分析其内部机制的有前景工具，为NCO社区提供了重要见解，并且这些见解可以转化为实际应用（如通过少量代码修改改进模型泛化）。

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

<details>

Motivation: 传统Shapley值计算需要枚举所有特征联盟，计算复杂度为O(2^n)，在大规模特征场景下不可行，需要更高效的近似方法

Method: 将预测器的局部行为表示为因子化多线性映射，将联盟量化为系数张量的线性探测，用少量目标评估替代穷举联盟扫描

Result: 在UCI数据集上，方法在拟合替代模型上匹配枚举结果，减少评估数量数个数量级，相比KernelSHAP-IQ实现25-1000倍加速，同时保持可比较精度

Conclusion: TN-SHAP通过张量网络表示有效降低了Shapley交互指数的计算复杂度，为大规模特征解释提供了实用的高效解决方案

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

Conclusion: NMKE通过细粒度编辑框架有效解决了终身知识编辑中的错误累积问题，实现了更精确和可持续的知识更新

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

### [528] [Power to the Clients: Federated Learning in a Dictatorship Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22149)
*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"独裁者客户端"的新型恶意参与者类别，能够完全消除其他客户端对服务器模型的贡献，同时保留自己的贡献，并分析了多独裁者客户端场景下的复杂交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性引入了安全漏洞，恶意客户端可能破坏或操纵训练过程，需要研究这类攻击的影响。

Method: 提出了具体的攻击策略，系统分析了独裁者客户端对学习过程的影响，并理论分析了多独裁者客户端场景（协作、独立行动、联盟背叛）对全局模型收敛的影响。

Result: 通过计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试的实证评估，支持了理论算法和关于多独裁者客户端复杂场景的发现。

Conclusion: 独裁者客户端构成了一种定义明确且可分析的恶意参与者类别，能够严重破坏联邦学习过程，需要开发相应的防御机制。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于排序的嵌入方法β_A，改进了嵌入维度D的上界并给出了下界，证明了其双Lipschitz失真与n的二次方相关且独立于d，并提供了降维变体的类似结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像深度学习中，需要输出对图像节点排列不变的嵌入方法。先前研究表明β_A嵌入在足够大的D下是单射且满足双Lipschitz条件，但存在两个问题：最优D维度未知，且没有双Lipschitz常数的估计。

Method: 研究基于排序的嵌入β_A: X ↦ ↓(XA)，其中↓表示矩阵的列排序。通过构造特定矩阵A来分析嵌入的单射性和双Lipschitz性质，并提供降维变体的扩展结果。

Result: 改进了嵌入维度D的上界并给出了最小单射维度的下界；构造了使β_A的双Lipschitz失真与n二次相关且独立于d的矩阵A；证明了失真至少为Ω(√n)；提供了降维变体的类似结果。

Conclusion: 本文在基于排序的嵌入方法研究上取得了重要进展，解决了嵌入维度优化和双Lipschitz常数估计两个关键问题，为图像深度学习中的排列不变嵌入提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对脑电图情感识别的任务特定多数据集联合预训练框架，通过跨数据集协方差对齐损失和混合编码器，解决了数据集分布差异、情感类别定义不一致和个体差异等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用预训练EEG模型在处理复杂任务（如情感识别）时存在任务特定特征与广泛预训练方法不匹配的问题，需要开发任务特定的预训练方法。

Method: 使用跨数据集协方差对齐损失来对齐不同数据集的二阶统计特性，并设计混合编码器结合Mamba类线性注意力通道编码器和时空动态模型来捕捉EEG的长期依赖和复杂动态。

Result: 在少样本情感识别中AUROC平均提升4.57%，在零样本泛化到新数据集时准确率提升11.92%，多数据集联合预训练比单数据集训练性能提升8.55%。

Conclusion: 该工作为任务特定预训练提供了可扩展框架，并展示了其在可泛化情感计算中的优势。

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在有损压缩领域的应用，在重建保真度和压缩比之间进行权衡，利用LLM作为强大的概率模型来实现更高效的文本压缩。

Method: 使用掩码语言模型作为解压缩器，允许模型预测被掩码的内容，仅当模型预测错误时存储基于排名的最小修正，创建提供连续率失真控制的残差通道。

Result: EPC在率失真分析中始终优于预测掩码基线方法，以显著更低的比特率提供更优的保真度，更有效地利用了模型的内在知识。

Conclusion: 误差有界预测编码方法通过利用语言模型的预测能力，在有损文本压缩中实现了更好的率失真性能，证明了LLM在有损压缩领域的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练模型在不同设计选择下表现出多样化的泛化行为，某些模型能掌握其他模型无法获得的数据特定洞察。利用这种多样性作为模型改进的辅助资源。

Method: 提出数据分区策略，让预训练模型自主选择学生或教师角色，实现双向知识转移。扩展该方法支持多个模型之间的知识转移。

Result: 在图像分类中，ViT-B通过双向知识转移性能提升约1.4%；在语义分割中，所有评估指标均得到提升；在视频显著性预测中达到新的最先进水平；多模型知识转移使所有参与模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用模型库作为辅助知识源是有效的模型改进策略，双向知识转移和跨架构知识转移都能带来显著性能提升。

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

Conclusion: 该交互式框架通过帮助用户理解模型在公平性-性能平衡和驱动预测的特征方面的差异，促进了明智的决策制定。

Abstract: In the context of algorithmic decision-making, fair machine learning methods
often yield multiple models that balance predictive fairness and performance in
varying degrees. This diversity introduces a challenge for stakeholders who
must select a model that aligns with their specific requirements and values. To
address this, we propose an interactive framework that assists in navigating
and interpreting the trade-offs across a portfolio of models. Our approach
leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

Method: 通过广泛的实验研究层剪枝对测试时缩放的影响，分析剪枝后模型在长推理基准上的表现，并尝试使用标准监督微调来恢复性能。

Result: 剪枝即使1-2层也会严重损害测试时缩放能力，长推理基准性能急剧下降，而知识密集和浅层推理任务性能保持稳定。标准微调无法恢复测试时缩放能力。

Conclusion: 层剪枝对推理密集型LLMs存在根本性风险，需要重新思考层剪枝策略，开发能够保持推理鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

Motivation: 解决EEG数据中电极布局异构性导致的模型泛化问题，传统方法难以处理不同公共数据集定义的电极布局差异。

Method: 使用学习查询和交叉注意力将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，下游transformer块仅在此潜在表示上操作，使用掩码补丁重建目标进行预训练。

Conclusion: LUNA成功解决了EEG电极布局异构性问题，提供了一个可扩展且高效的基础模型，在多个下游任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

Motivation: 现实场景中测试图常存在数据质量问题和分布偏移，导致预训练模型性能下降。研究发现通过调整测试图结构的同质性可以显著改善模型鲁棒性

Result: 在9个基准数据集上的实验表明，GrapHoST在多种测试时数据质量问题下均取得最优性能，最高提升10.92%

Conclusion: 基于同质性的测试时图结构转换是提升预训练GNN模型鲁棒性的有效方法

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate

TL;DR: 开发了MASER预测模型，使用LASSO逻辑回归预测代谢功能障碍相关脂肪肝病，在保持可解释性的同时实现了竞争性性能（AUROC 0.84），并通过公平性后处理减少了种族和民族亚组间的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MASLD影响约33%的美国成年人，是最常见的慢性肝病。早期检测很重要，因为生活方式干预可以预防疾病进展。需要开发公平、严谨且可重复的预测模型。

Method: 评估了LASSO逻辑回归、随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络，使用临床特征子集（包括前10个SHAP排名特征）。应用了机会均等后处理方法以减少种族和民族亚组间真阳性率的差异。

Result: 包含59,492名训练患者，24,198名验证患者和25,188名测试患者。公平性调整前：AUROC 0.84，准确率78%，敏感性72%，特异性79%，F1分数0.617。公平性调整后：准确率81%，特异性94%，敏感性41%，F1分数0.515。

Conclusion: MASER预测模型在MASLD预测中实现了竞争性性能，与先前报告的集成和基于树的模型相当。该方法表明可解释模型可以在多样化患者群体中实现预测性能和公平性的平衡。

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

TL;DR: 该研究利用迁移学习微调大规模预训练的ECG基础模型，从心电图中非侵入性地估计实验室指标，在108个指标中展示了不同程度的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实验室检测依赖侵入性静脉采样且存在延迟，而心电图作为非侵入性广泛可用的信号，有望实现快速实验室指标估计。

Method: 使用迁移学习方法在斯坦福MC-MED数据集上微调ECGFounder基础模型，生成了超过2000万个标准化十秒ECG片段以增强对生化相关性的敏感性。

Result: 在内部验证中，模型对33个实验室指标表现出强预测性能(AUC>0.65)，59个指标中等性能(0.55-0.65)，16个指标性能有限(<0.55)。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了高效的人工智能驱动解决方案，确立了实时非侵入性实验室值估计的可行性范围。

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类类比推理受限于领域专业知识和表面偏见，而LLMs在跨领域数据训练下具有潜力进行科学类比推理

Method: 使用两种明确类比推理策略：(1)检索跨领域类比和类比引导示例来扩展探索；(2)从少量标记样本构建领域内类比模板来指导定向开发

Result: 这些策略产生了既定成分空间之外的候选材料，并优于标准提示基准

Conclusion: LLMs可作为可解释的、专家级的假设生成器，利用类比驱动的泛化推动科学创新

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

TL;DR: 论文研究节点状态监控问题，提出基于预测不确定性的查询策略，分析贪婪策略的性能，并在未知转移概率情况下提出学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 节点状态随时间变化，监控器需要跟踪状态但查询有固定成本，因此需要平衡预测和查询的成本效益。

Method: 使用贪婪策略（当预测损失低于查询成本时预测，否则查询），分析其在马尔可夫设置下的性能，并提出基于投影随机梯度下降的学习变体。

Result: 贪婪策略在一般情况下是次优的且竞争比无界，但在相同分布转移概率条件下接近最优；学习算法在计算效率上优于最优策略。

Conclusion: 贪婪策略在特定条件下表现良好，提出的学习算法能有效平衡预测和查询的权衡，具有计算效率优势。

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

TL;DR: 本研究重新评估了前馈层特征向量与稀疏自编码器学习特征的可解释性，发现两者在可解释性方面表现相似，SAE仅有微小改进，在某些方面甚至前馈层表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型可解释性研究主要关注通过代理模块发现特征，但缺乏对这些学习特征与原始模型参数中已有特征的比较。本研究旨在系统比较稀疏自编码器学习特征与前馈层特征向量的可解释性。

Method: 采用现代可解释性基准，从前馈层作为键值存储器的视角，重新评估前馈层特征向量的可解释性，并与稀疏自编码器学习特征进行系统比较。

Result: 研究发现SAE和前馈层在可解释性方面表现出相似的范围，SAE在某些方面有微小改进。令人惊讶的是，在某些方面标准前馈层甚至比SAE具有更好的可解释性，且两者发现的特征存在分歧。

Conclusion: 研究对SAE在特征质量和忠实性方面的优势提出质疑，建议将前馈层键值参数作为现代可解释性研究的强基线。

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法需要材料参数先验选择，或仅限于模型库的线性系数，或推断参数概率分布灵活性受限。

Method: 四步框架：1) 用高斯过程增强应力-变形数据；2) 用归一化流近似参数分布；3) 通过匹配参数诱导的应力-变形函数分布与高斯过程后验来精炼参数分布；4) 进行Sobol'敏感性分析以获得稀疏可解释模型。

Result: 框架在各项同性和各向异性实验数据以及线性和非线性模型库中均表现出良好能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了本构模型发现中的不确定性量化问题，无需先验选择且支持非线性模型发现。

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链追踪虽然承诺提供推理透明度，但并非总是忠实反映内部计算，可能导致从业者误将装饰性推理视为真实推理。

Method: 引入Concept Walk框架，在激活空间中追踪模型内部立场在概念方向上的演化，通过对比数据学习概念方向，将每个推理步骤投影到该方向上。

Result: 在Qwen 3-4B模型的安全领域案例研究中，发现简单案例中扰乱的思维链被快速忽略，而困难案例中扰动会引发内部激活的持续变化。

Conclusion: Concept Walk提供了通过概念特定内部动态重新审视忠实性的方法，有助于识别何时可以信任推理痕迹，何时可能误导从业者。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted in high-stakes
decision-making domains, ensuring fairness in their outputs has become a
central challenge. At the core of fair ML research are the datasets used to
investigate bias and develop mitigation strategies. Yet, much of the existing
work relies on a narrow selection of datasets--often arbitrarily chosen,
inconsistently processed, and lacking in diversity--undermining the
generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,
data corpus, and Python package aimed at advancing reproducible research and
critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our
accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing,
transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows. By
providing a diverse and well-documented dataset corpus along with robust
tooling, FairGround enables the development of fairer, more reliable, and more
reproducible ML models. All resources are publicly available to support open
and collaborative research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度上升(GA)方法在LLM遗忘中存在严重不稳定性，会导致模型效用大幅下降，需要一种更稳定的遗忘方法。

Method: SGA将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据通过可调平滑率结合，从仅学习遗忘数据扩展到联合学习遗忘和正常数据。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试中，SGA在所有指标上均优于原始GA方法，并在多个关键指标上达到所有基线方法的前2名。

Conclusion: SGA通过平滑梯度上升机制有效解决了GA的不稳定性问题，实现了更稳定的LLM遗忘同时保持模型效用。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

Conclusion: 基于生命游戏的动态单元失活是一种有效的正则化替代方案，在深层架构中能增强不同dropout技术的性能。

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

Motivation: 在线平台用户行为不断变化，导致模型性能随时间下降（数据漂移）。持续微调会引发灾难性遗忘，而基于回放的方法受限于固定缓冲区大小。

Method: 在基于回放的持续学习框架中引入外部知识库进行数据增强，评估了多种集成外部知识的策略。

Result: 实验使用三个异常行为分类数据集，证明增强方法优于基线回放方法。

Conclusion: 通过外部知识增强可以有效提升基于回放的持续学习性能，克服缓冲区大小限制。

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

Result: 建立了量化分辨率的信息论下界，证明了批处理版本在线性和非线性量化下都能达到接近下界的性能，在非线性量化设置下实现了几乎与维度无关的量化误差。

Conclusion: 低精度方法在合成数据流上的实验验证了理论发现，表明这些方法能够紧密跟踪标准Oja算法的性能，为有限精度环境下的流式PCA提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络使用固定统一的激活函数，但不同神经元可能需要不同的激活函数来优化性能。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段使用可微分硬混合机制让神经元从候选激活函数池中选择；第二阶段固定激活函数，支持向量化操作。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上的实验显示，不同层级的神经元对激活函数有不同偏好，揭示了神经网络内部的功能多样性。

Conclusion: SmartMixed能够有效学习神经元特定的激活函数，提升网络性能同时保持推理效率。

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space

*Jing Yang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Yufeng Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GradLite优化器，通过放松对精确梯度的要求，在激进丢弃或近似中间激活时仍能高效训练，减少内存消耗达50%且性能相当或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器如SGD或Adam需要精确梯度，导致大语言模型全微调时内存消耗巨大。现有解决方案要么改变模型架构，要么以计算换内存，但优化器本身未被触及。

Method: GradLite采用两种关键技术：(1)低秩雅可比近似，降低反向传播误差信号的维度；(2)误差反馈校正，在迭代间累积和补偿近似误差以保持收敛保证。

Result: 理论分析显示GradLite保持无偏梯度估计且有界方差，收敛速度与Adam相当。实证中，GradLite将优化器状态和激活内存消耗减少达50%，在推理、多语言和对话基准测试中性能与检查点方法和优化器基线相当或更优。

Conclusion: GradLite是一种向后兼容的优化器，通过放松精确梯度要求，在不改变架构的情况下显著减少内存消耗，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

TL;DR: CORGII是一个图索引框架，将密集图表示转换为稀疏二进制码，利用倒排索引实现高效的子图同构查询，在准确性和效率之间提供更好的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多向量图表示的方法虽然能提供准确的子图同构测试，但由于需要穷举评分语料库中的图，在检索应用中受到限制。

Method: 使用上下文密集图表示，通过可微分离散化模块计算稀疏二进制码，映射到学习的潜在词汇表，利用倒排索引支持软集合包含分数，并引入可训练的权重和令牌扩展。

Result: 实验表明CORGII在准确性和效率之间提供了比多个基线方法更好的权衡。

Conclusion: CORGII是首个使用离散令牌映射到高效倒排列表的密集图表示索引器，为大规模图检索提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

TL;DR: LAMP是一个数据高效的3D生成框架，通过线性仿射混合参数化形状实现可控和可解释的3D几何生成，支持边界内插值、安全外推和物理性能优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量训练数据，在可控性和泛化性方面存在局限，需要开发数据效率高且可控的3D生成方法。

Method: 首先通过共享初始化对每个示例过拟合SDF解码器进行对齐，然后在对齐权重空间中解决参数约束混合问题来合成新几何，并提出线性度不匹配的安全指标检测几何有效性。

Result: 在DrivAerNet++和BlendedNet基准测试中，LAMP仅需100个样本即可实现边界内插值控制，支持超出训练范围100%参数差异的安全外推，并在固定参数下进行物理性能优化，显著优于条件自编码器和DNI基线。

Conclusion: LAMP推进了可控、数据高效且安全的3D生成，适用于设计探索、数据集生成和性能驱动优化。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于互补标签的可扩展监督框架，用于评估和训练前沿AI系统，无需真实标签，利用专家提供的弱信号（指出错误选项）来估计模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在复杂任务上超越人类专家，获取高质量人工监督变得困难。专家通常只精通单一领域，无法评估AI在超人类任务上的表现，但能提供互补标签指出错误选项。

Method: 从互补标签推导无偏的top-1准确率估计器，量化所需互补标签数量；提出两种估计器结合稀缺真实标签和丰富互补标签；提供有限样本偏差保证。

Result: 实证表明无需真实标签即可评估大语言模型输出，并能训练AI系统在分区人工监督下表现更好。

Conclusion: 互补标签为评估和训练前沿AI系统提供了可行的弱监督方法，解决了高质量人工监督稀缺的问题。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

Result: 在14个实际任务中，LLEMA发现的候选材料化学可行、热力学稳定且性质对齐，相比生成式和纯LLM基线获得更高的命中率和更强的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: LLEMA通过强制合成可行性和多目标权衡，为加速实用材料发现提供了原则性路径，消融研究证实了规则引导生成、基于记忆优化和代理预测的重要性。

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

TL;DR: 本文分析了连续扩散模型在离散数据上表现不佳的原因，提出了token可识别性框架来解释高斯噪声对离散数据的双重破坏机制，并提出了CANDI混合框架来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续扩散在连续域（如图像生成）表现出色，但在离散数据上表现不如纯离散方法，这一差距与直觉相悖，因为连续扩散能够学习跨多个位置的联合演化。

Method: 提出了CANDI（连续和离散扩散）混合框架，将离散和连续破坏解耦，同时学习条件结构和连续几何。通过分析token可识别性框架，揭示了高斯噪声对离散数据的双重破坏机制。

Result: 实证验证了时间不协调现象，并证明CANDI成功避免了这一问题。在可控生成中，CANDI通过简单梯度加法实现基于分类器的引导；在文本生成中，CANDI在低NFE下优于掩码扩散。

Conclusion: CANDI解锁了连续扩散在离散空间中的优势，展示了学习连续梯度对离散空间的价值。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

TL;DR: 提出TRL算法，一种基于分治范式的值学习算法，用于离线目标条件强化学习，通过三角不等式结构实现高效的值更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线目标条件强化学习中传统方法（如TD和蒙特卡洛）存在的偏差累积和高方差问题，特别是在长轨迹场景下。

Method: 将GCRL中的三角不等式结构转化为实用的分治值更新规则，仅需O(log T)次递归处理长度为T的轨迹。

Result: 在极具挑战性的长视野基准任务中，TRL相比之前的离线GCRL算法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: TRL通过分治方法有效解决了离线GCRL中的偏差和方差问题，在长轨迹任务中表现优异。

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

Motivation: 现实世界的有符号图存在噪声，现有方法缺乏理论指导，需要提高SGNN的鲁棒性

Method: 扩展图信息瓶颈理论，实现输入空间和目标空间联合去噪，使用重参数化机制和变分近似构建可处理的目标函数

Result: 在四个流行有符号图数据集上的实验表明，RIDGE显著提高了SGNN模型在不同噪声水平下的鲁棒性

Conclusion: RIDGE通过理论指导的联合去噪方法有效提升了有符号图学习的鲁棒性

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合整数优化方法只能处理小规模数据集，限制了带约束聚类的实际应用，需要可扩展的全局优化方法

Method: 使用可分解的分支定界框架，将must-link样本合并为伪样本，通过几何规则剪枝cannot-link约束，结合分组样本拉格朗日分解和几何消除规则

Result: 能处理20万样本的cannot-link约束和150万样本的must-link约束，比现有方法规模大200-1500倍，最优性差距小于3%

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模带约束聚类提供了确定性全局保证，避免了启发式方法在大数据集上的搜索失败问题

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

Motivation: 随机游走神经网络在处理图表示学习时，由于实际采样限制往往无法捕获全局结构，即使在小型图中也因节点和边覆盖不完整而限制了表达能力。

Method: 提出随机搜索神经网络(RSNN)，基于随机搜索操作，每个搜索保证完整的节点覆盖。理论证明在稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索即可实现完整边覆盖。

Result: RSNN在分子和蛋白质基准测试中始终优于RWNN，使用最多16倍更少的采样序列实现了相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: RSNN为基于随机游走的方法提供了理论和实践上的进步，为稀疏图学习提供了一个高效且表达力强的框架。

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

Conclusion: IsoNet++通过早期交互、惰性对齐更新和节点对交互的创新设计，有效提升了子图匹配的检索准确性。

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

Motivation: 在基于可验证奖励的强化学习中，模型可能会学习到包含答案猜测和跳跃推理等缺陷的推理模式，但这些有缺陷的轨迹仍被奖励为正样本，导致模型内化不可靠的推理模式。

Method: 提出Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO)，对有缺陷的正样本轨迹施加参数无关的奖励惩罚；引入生成式奖励模型(GenRM)来精确检测推理错误。

Result: FAPO在多个领域有效，提高了结果正确性、过程可靠性和训练稳定性，且不增加token预算。

Conclusion: FAPO方法能够有效利用有缺陷轨迹作为热身阶段的捷径，同时在精炼阶段转向可靠的推理模式，解决了RLVR中的缺陷轨迹问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

Motivation: 随着技术进步，过程日志越来越多地来自非确定性源（如不确定传感器或机器学习模型），这些包含概率信息的随机日志需要可靠的随机轨迹恢复方法来理解系统过程。

Method: 基于扩散去噪概率模型(DDPM)的深度学习方法，利用过程知识（隐式发现模型或显式注入过程知识到训练阶段）通过去噪来恢复轨迹。

Result: 经验评估显示达到最先进性能，相比现有方法提升达25%，在高噪声水平下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为不确定性日志的轨迹恢复提供了有效的解决方案，在性能和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于学习对抗性凸成本函数序列同时近似满足对抗性在线凸约束序列的随时在线算法，无需事先知道时间范围长度即可提供中间时间步的性能保证。

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and
interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins
numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

TL;DR: CLEANet是一个针对受污染多元时间序列的鲁棒高效异常检测框架，通过污染弹性训练框架和轻量级共轭MLP解决训练数据污染和推理效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多元时间序列异常检测面临两个关键挑战：训练数据污染（噪声和隐藏异常）以及低效的模型推理。现有方法假设训练数据干净，但污染会扭曲学习模式并降低检测精度。

Method: 提出CLEANet框架，包含污染弹性训练框架（CRTF），通过自适应重构加权策略和聚类引导的对比学习来减轻污染样本影响；设计轻量级共轭MLP来解耦时间和跨特征依赖关系。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上，CLEANet相比十个最先进基线方法，F1分数提升高达73.04%，运行时间降低81.28%。将CRTF集成到三个先进模型中平均获得5.35%的F1增益。

Conclusion: CLEANet有效解决了多元时间序列异常检测中的数据污染和效率问题，具有强泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

Motivation: 解决在在线学习环境中，系统需要动态选择多个自适应学习算法，但受限于训练预算（每轮只能更新部分专家）的现实问题

Method: 提出M-LCB算法，一种基于UCB的高效元算法，直接使用已实现的损失构建置信区间，无需额外优化

Result: M-LCB确保整体遗憾界为Õ(√(KT/M) + (K/M)^(1-α)T^α)，其中α是专家内部遗憾的收敛指数

Conclusion: 这是首个在每轮预算约束下同时训练多个自适应专家的遗憾保证结果，将经典bandit范式扩展到协调有状态自学习专家的更现实场景

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

Conclusion: 通过正交和超完备空间的互补几何特性，可以替代传统数据增强，实现更优的表示学习性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

Method: 采用流匹配技术建模价值分布并生成样本进行价值估计，构建生成式价值估计范式

Result: 

Conclusion: 流匹配技术为价值估计提供了新的生成式范式，能够更好地表达复杂价值分布

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and

they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

TL;DR: 本文分析了GP-BO在DBMS自动调优中的局限性，提出了一种新的基于随机梯度提升集成和共形预测的自动调优器Centrum，实现了分布无关的贝叶斯优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GP-BO方法在DBMS性能建模中存在基本假设被广泛违反的问题，而树集成BO方法虽然能避免这些假设陷阱，但现有方法在不确定性估计上仍存在不现实的分布假设，限制了DBMS自动调优的进一步发展。

Method: 提出Centrum自动调优器，采用两阶段随机梯度提升集成学习改进分布无关的点估计和区间估计，并采用广义SGBE估计的局部自适应共形预测来实现分布无关的不确定性估计和采集函数。

Result: 在两个DBMS和三个工作负载上的大量物理和模拟实验表明，Centrum优于21种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Centrum是首个实现分布无关性的自动调优器，增强了BO在DBMS自动调优中的实用性，也是首个无缝融合梯度提升集成和共形推理的BO方法。

Abstract: Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), is a prevailing
model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于扩散模型的分布鲁棒优化方法D-DRO，通过扩散模型构建模糊集，在保持与名义分布一致性的同时捕捉超出名义支撑空间的各种对抗分布，实现更好的分布外泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分布鲁棒优化需要设计有效的模糊集，既要保持与名义分布的一致性，又要足够多样化以涵盖各种潜在场景，同时还要保证优化问题的可解性。

Method: 提出了基于扩散模型的模糊集设计，通过参数化扩散模型空间解决内层最大化问题，构建了扩散基分布鲁棒优化算法D-DRO。

Result: 理论证明了D-DRO的平稳收敛性能，并在机器学习预测任务中实证展示了其优越的分布外泛化性能。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的模糊集设计为分布鲁棒优化提供了有效的解决方案，能够显著提升模型在分布外场景下的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

TL;DR: TALE是一种推理时算法，通过直接优化任务特定验证性能来修剪整个Transformer层，无需重新训练即可提高准确性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在修剪Transformer层时通常需要重新训练，且无法保证任务性能的提升。TALE旨在通过直接优化任务特定性能来实现无需重新训练的高效层修剪。

Method: TALE在推理时根据任务特定验证性能直接修剪整个Transformer层，通过互信息分析识别瓶颈层，并提供灵活的用户控制来平衡准确性和效率。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上的评估显示，TALE在零样本和少样本设置下均能一致提高准确性并减少计算成本，在微调过程中应用还能带来额外性能提升。

Conclusion: TALE通过选择性移除瓶颈层，产生了更小、更快、更准确的模型，同时为Transformer可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SeeDNorm，一种动态调整缩放系数的归一化方法，通过保留输入范数信息和实现数据依赖的自重缩放，提升了模型在零样本场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMSNorm丢弃了输入范数信息，静态缩放因子无法适应输入数据和分布变化的广泛变异性，限制了性能提升，特别是在大语言模型常遇到的零样本场景中。

Method: SeeDNorm基于当前输入动态调整缩放系数，保留输入范数信息，实现数据依赖的自重缩放动态归一化。在反向传播中保持RMSNorm根据输入范数动态调整梯度的能力。

Result: 在不同规模的大语言模型预训练以及监督和无监督计算机视觉任务中，SeeDNorm均取得了优于RMSNorm、LayerNorm和DyT等常用归一化层的性能。

Conclusion: SeeDNorm通过引入最少数量的参数且对模型效率影响可忽略，实现了持续优越的性能，解决了RMSNorm在零样本场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

TL;DR: NBF-Rec是一种基于图的推荐模型，支持在用户和物品集合不相交的数据集之间进行归纳迁移学习，无需为每个领域重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于图的推荐系统通常在转导设置下训练，限制了其对新用户、新物品或新数据集的适用性。

Method: NBF-Rec在推理时动态计算节点嵌入，使用交互级消息传递，支持零样本设置和轻量级微调。

Result: 在7个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，NBF-Rec在零样本设置下取得竞争性性能，并通过轻量级微调进一步改进。

Conclusion: 基于图的推荐中的归纳迁移是可行的，交互级消息传递支持跨数据集泛化，无需对齐的用户或物品。

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习依赖显式模型和领域假设，限制了灵活性和可解释性。需要一种能够直接分析原始数据、减少偏差、支持高效更新的统一框架。

Method: 使用信息论中的惊奇度（不确定性）来量化相关性，构建无模型框架，消除分布建模需求，支持数据直接编辑和删除操作。

Result: 在生成推理、因果发现、异常检测和时间序列预测等任务中达到或接近最先进性能，能够有效处理复杂数据类型包括缺失数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展机器学习和人工智能提供了神经网络之外的可行替代路径，同时保持了底层机制的人类可理解性，创建了信息的"物理学"基础。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分布式多智能体多臂老虎机问题，其中智能体在随机通信图上进行交互，且每个智能体对同一臂的奖励分布可能不同，目标是相对于每个臂在所有智能体上的平均期望奖励最小化累积遗憾。

Method: 提出了一种完全分布式算法，将臂消除策略与随机gossip算法相结合，在时变随机通信图上进行协作学习。

Result: 理论证明遗憾上界为O(log T)，包含最优集中式遗憾项和反映通信图代数连通性与链路概率影响的额外项，揭示了通信效率与遗憾之间的基本权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该算法在随机通信图上实现了高效的分布式学习，数值实验验证了理论结果的正确性和算法的优越性。

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LOESS分解、ARIMA建模和多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络的混合预测框架，用于印度大城市的空气质量指数预测，在多个污染物上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度大城市空气质量问题严重，污染物浓度突然飙升给及时干预带来挑战。AQI预测困难在于同时存在线性趋势、季节变化和波动非线性模式。

Method: 使用LOESS分解将AQI序列分离为趋势、季节和残差分量，ARIMA建模平滑分量，提出的深度学习模块捕捉残差中的多尺度波动，通过UAMMO优化器调整超参数。

Result: 在2021-2023年中央污染控制委员会数据集上的实验表明，该方法在PM2.5、O3、CO和NOx等污染物上均优于统计、深度学习和混合基线方法，MSE降低5-8%，R²得分>0.94。

Conclusion: 该框架在应对突发污染事件方面表现出鲁棒性和敏感性，适用于城市空气质量管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

TL;DR: 本文分析了BOBW FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的最后迭代收敛率，发现使用1/2-Tsallis-INF算法的Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注遗憾界分析，而最后迭代收敛率（简单遗憾）在赌博机问题中较少被探索，特别是对于广泛研究的FTRL算法。对数遗憾直觉上应对应t^{-1}的最后迭代收敛率，但这一直觉尚未得到理论验证。

Method: 通过理论分析研究BOBW FTRL算法，特别是1/2-Tsallis-INF算法，分析其Bregman散度（由正则函数Ψ(p)=-4∑√p_i定义）在最优臂点质量与算法在迭代t时获得的臂集概率分布之间的衰减速率。

Result: 部分证实了直觉：Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减，而不是预期的t^{-1}速率。

Conclusion: 虽然对数遗憾直觉上应对应t^{-1}收敛率，但实际分析显示BOBW FTRL算法的最后迭代收敛率为t^{-1/2}，表明直觉与理论结果之间存在差距。

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

Motivation: 传统GAN缺乏可解释性和逻辑保证，希望通过结合逻辑推理来提供可验证的生成质量保证和可解释的失败原因。

Method: 使用深度k的Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé博弈作为判别器，生成器需要生成能通过k轮EF匹配检验的样本，同时提供EF探针模拟器和MSO图检查器工具包。

Conclusion: LOGAN提供了一种紧凑、可复现的逻辑约束生成方法，具有可解释的失败原因和可调节的控制参数。

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于单细胞RNA测序数据的潜在即插即用扩散框架，通过分离观测空间和去噪空间来提高聚类准确性，具有自适应噪声处理、不确定性量化和通用化去噪三大优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据存在测量噪声和生物变异性，导致在标准潜在空间中不同细胞类型的数据可能投影得很接近，使得准确聚类变得困难。

Method: 引入潜在即插即用扩散框架，通过新颖的Gibbs采样程序分离观测和去噪空间：在低维潜在空间应用学习到的扩散先验进行去噪，同时在原始高维观测空间重新引入噪声来引导该过程。

Result: 在合成数据和真实单细胞基因组数据上评估了鲁棒性。在合成数据上，在不同噪声水平和数据集偏移下提高了聚类准确性；在真实单细胞数据上，得到的细胞簇具有更好的生物学一致性，簇边界与已知细胞类型标记和发育轨迹更吻合。

Conclusion: 该方法通过独特的"输入空间引导"确保去噪轨迹忠实于原始数据结构，为单细胞RNA测序数据分析提供了更准确的聚类结果和更好的生物学解释性。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出了一个物理信息机器学习框架，用于建模和预测随机FitzHugh-Nagumo神经元中的自诱导随机共振现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自诱导随机共振（SISR）是慢-快可兴奋系统中仅由噪声驱动而出现相干振荡的现象，无需外部周期性强迫或接近分岔点。需要开发数据高效且可解释的替代模型来模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性。

Method: 基于噪声增强状态预测器架构的物理信息神经网络（PINN），将控制随机微分方程和SISR渐近时间尺度匹配约束直接嵌入网络。复合损失函数整合了数据保真度、动力学残差和基于Kramers逃逸理论的物理约束。

Result: 训练后的PINN准确预测了尖峰序列相干性对噪声强度、兴奋性和时间尺度分离的依赖性，与直接随机模拟结果匹配，相比纯数据驱动方法在准确性和泛化性上有显著改进，同时计算量大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性提供了一个数据高效且可解释的替代模型。

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

Result: E2D2在摘要、翻译和数学推理任务上实现了生成质量和推理吞吐量之间的优越权衡

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构能够有效加速离散扩散模型推理，同时保持生成质量

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

Abstract: Precipitation prediction has undergone a profound transformation -- from
early symbolic and empirical methods rooted in divination and observation, to
modern technologies based on atmospheric physics and artificial intelligence.
This review traces the historical and technological evolution of precipitation
forecasting, presenting a survey about end-to-end precipitation prediction
technologies that spans ancient practices, the foundations of meteorological
science, the rise of numerical weather prediction (NWP), and the emergence of
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. We first explore
traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development
of physical modeling and statistical frameworks that underpin contemporary
operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the
history of end-to-end precipitation prediction but also outlines future
directions in next generation forecasting systems.

TL;DR: RLPD-GX是一个混合离线-在线强化学习框架，通过将策略优化与安全执行解耦来解决分布偏移问题。奖励寻求的学习器自由探索，而基于投影的守护器保证规则一致执行和安全值备份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合离线-在线强化学习(O2O RL)结合了样本效率和鲁棒探索的优势，但由于离线与在线数据之间的分布偏移而存在不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出RLPD-GX框架，将策略优化与安全执行解耦：奖励寻求的学习器自由探索，投影守护器保证规则一致执行和安全值备份。还提出动态课程学习，逐步扩展时间视野并退火离线-在线数据混合。

Result: 在Atari-100k上达到3.02的标准化平均分数（比先前混合方法提高45%），具有更强的安全性和稳定性。在其他安全关键和长视野任务上也表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 解耦的安全执行为鲁棒O2O RL提供了一条简单而有原则的路径，为强化学习中探索与安全的协调提供了更广泛的范式。

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在48小时后预测稳定性不足，特别是在监测网络稀疏的城市中，无法满足公共卫生预警系统的长期预测需求

Method: 结合DTW进行智能站点相似性选择，使用轻量级CNN-GRU架构并增强气象特征，针对稀疏网络优化的可扩展设计

Result: 在8个监测站多年小时数据验证中表现优于现有深度学习方法，24小时预测R2=0.91，首次实现10天稳定预测（240小时R2=0.73）

Conclusion: 该框架计算效率高且不依赖外部工具，特别适合在资源受限的城市环境中部署，解决了关键预警系统需求

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证基础模型在临床表型发现中的有效性，避免表面真实但临床不连贯的嵌入表示风险。

Method: 训练了两个自回归模型（LSTM和简化Transformer）在HIV和急性低血压数据集上，通过添加随机访问间隔来模拟不规则性，评估患者轨迹合成的分布和相关性保真度。

Result: 两个模型都能重现特征分布，但无法保持跨特征结构，表明生成式预训练产生局部真实性但临床连贯性有限。

Conclusion: 需要领域特定的评估方法，轨迹合成可作为微调或部署前的实用探针。

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习框架，通过可学习的客户端嵌入控制来解决多模态联邦学习中数据不完整和异构的问题，实现局部自适应表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多模态联邦学习经常遇到客户端数据不完整和异构的问题，导致局部特征表示不对齐，限制了模型聚合的效果。现有方法要么假设模态集不同但输入特征完整，要么假设共享模态集但存在缺失特征，而本文考虑更一般和现实的场景：每个客户端观察不同的模态子集，且每个模态内也可能有缺失特征。

Method: 提出基于可学习客户端嵌入控制的联邦学习框架，这些嵌入编码客户端的数据缺失模式，作为重新配置信号来对齐全局聚合表示与每个客户端的局部上下文。嵌入控制可以在具有相似数据缺失模式的客户端间算法聚合，增强重新配置信号在适应全局表示时的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个具有不同数据缺失模式的联邦多模态基准测试中，该方法在严重数据不完整情况下实现了高达36.45%的性能提升。理论分析提供了明确的性能界限，与实证观察一致。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过客户端嵌入控制有效解决了多模态联邦学习中的表示不对齐问题，在现实数据不完整场景下表现出显著性能优势，并有理论支撑。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks
with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under
severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical
analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical
observations. Our source codes are provided at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对齐方法MMPO，通过最大边际似然估计来优化LLM与人类偏好对齐，无需显式奖励模型和熵最大化，在稳定性和性能上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF方法复杂且不稳定，需要简化对齐过程并提高稳定性。

Method: 基于最大边际似然估计的偏好优化方法，使用偏好对作为样本近似，隐式执行偏好优化。

Result: 在135M到8B参数模型上，MMPO在超参数稳定性、偏好对齐效果和基础语言能力保持方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MMPO提供了一种更简单稳定的对齐方法，能够有效优化偏好同时保持模型基础能力。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

Abstract: Natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, pose significant challenges to
daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard

behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

Conclusion: SSBA提供了一种简单有效的模型无关方法，能够计算最近可行（即符合约束的现实）反事实解释，适用于高维空间和现实世界约束场景。

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large
language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge
growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to
establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

### [610] [RL-AUX: Reinforcement Learning for Auxiliary Task Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22940)
*Judah Goldfeder,Matthew So,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的辅助学习框架，动态生成辅助任务标签并学习每个样本的辅助损失权重，在CIFAR100数据集上超越了人工标注的辅助任务和双级优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统辅助学习需要人工标注辅助任务，耗费人力且需要领域专业知识。现有的元学习方法使用双级优化，计算成本高且代码复杂。

Method: 使用强化学习代理为训练集中的每个数据点选择辅助标签，当选择能提升主任务性能时给予奖励。同时实验学习每个数据点的辅助损失权重优化策略。

Result: 在20-Superclass CIFAR100问题上，RL方法优于人工标注的辅助任务，与双级优化方法表现相当。权重学习方法显著超越所有基准，VGG16架构达到80.9%测试准确率（人工标注为75.53%）。

Conclusion: 强化学习是动态生成辅助任务的有效方法，同时学习每个样本的辅助任务权重可以取得优异结果。

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

### [611] [Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin for Climate-Driven Urban Resilience and Equity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22941)
*Zhenglai Shen,Hongyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种灾害响应数字孪生(H-RDT)框架，结合物理信息神经网络、多模态数据融合和公平感知风险分析，用于城市级灾害响应。在模拟的野火-停电-热浪连锁灾害中，该系统能维持稳定的室内温度预测，并通过强化学习自适应融合物联网、无人机和卫星数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合气候灾害（如野火引发的停电和城市热浪）挑战城市的稳定性和公平性，需要开发能够整合物理灾害建模与社会公平的决策支持系统。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络建模、多模态数据融合和公平感知风险分析，构建灾害响应数字孪生。通过强化学习模块自适应重加权物联网、无人机和卫星输入，维持时空覆盖。

Result: 在部分传感器丢失情况下，H-RDT能维持稳定的室内温度预测（约31-33°C），再现停电驱动的温度激增和恢复。前瞻性干预措施（如预防性冷却中心激活和微电网共享）使人口加权热风险降低11-13%，尾部风险降低7-17%，过热时间减少达9%。

Conclusion: H-RDT为实际城市实施建立了可转移的基础，将物理灾害建模与社会公平和决策智能联系起来，推动数字城市韧性向自适应、基于学习和以公平为中心的决策支持发展。

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for
urban-scale response. In a synthetic district with diverse building archetypes
and populations, a simulated wildfire-outage-heatwave cascade shows that H-RDT
maintains stable indoor temperature predictions (approximately 31 to 33 C)
under partial sensor loss, reproducing outage-driven surges and recovery. The
reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过正则化状态空间模型的Hankel奇异值之和来提高模型可压缩性的方法，使得训练后的模型压缩率提升10倍同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于状态空间模型的深度神经网络在长序列任务中表现良好，但训练后压缩困难。作者希望找到一种方法能够在保持模型性能的同时提高其可压缩性。

Method: 开发了一种算法，在训练迭代期间高效计算Hankel奇异值，通过利用状态空间模型参数化中系统矩阵的特定块对角结构来实现可扩展性。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，正则化的状态空间层比标准状态空间层可压缩性提高达10倍，同时保持高准确率。

Conclusion: Hankel奇异值正则化是提高状态空间模型可压缩性的有效方法，通过利用系统矩阵的特殊结构实现了高效的可扩展训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA)方法，将流形几何融入核对齐任务，相比传统的CKA方法更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的中心核对齐(CKA)方法不考虑底层流形结构，依赖大量启发式方法，在不同数据规模下表现不一致。

Method: 提出了MKA方法，将流形几何纳入核对齐任务，并建立了理论框架。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界示例上的实证评估表明，MKA比现有方法更稳健。

Conclusion: 流形感知的核对齐为表示度量提供了更稳健的基础，在表示学习中有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

*Junhao Fan,Wenrui Liang,Wei-Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARNet是一个用于预测剩余使用寿命(RUL)的轻量级框架，通过尖峰感知检测和现代时序卷积网络提高预测精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RUL预测模型在故障开始时表现脆弱，对工程师不透明：短时高能尖峰被平滑或误读，固定阈值降低灵敏度，缺乏基于物理的解释。

Method: 基于现代时序卷积网络(ModernTCN)预测退化敏感指标，添加自适应连续阈值验证真实尖峰并抑制噪声，对故障易发段进行针对性特征工程，最后使用堆叠RF-LGBM回归器生成RUL。

Result: 在基准数据集上，SARNet相比现有基线持续降低误差(RMSE 0.0365, MAE 0.0204)，同时保持轻量、鲁棒且易于部署。

Conclusion: SARNet通过尖峰感知检测和物理信息可解释性，显著提高了RUL预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across
benchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet
consistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE
0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.

### [615] [The Reasoning Trap: How Enhancing LLM Reasoning Amplifies Tool Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22977)
*Chenlong Yin,Zeyang Sha,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现增强大型语言模型的推理能力会因果性地增加工具幻觉，这种效应与训练方法无关且难以避免，揭示了当前推理增强方法在可靠性和能力之间的根本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OpenAI的o3等观察表明，更强的推理能力往往伴随着更多幻觉，但之前没有研究系统性地检验推理增强本身是否会导致工具幻觉。

Method: 构建了SimpleToolHalluBench诊断基准，通过控制实验研究两种失败模式下的工具幻觉：无可用工具和仅有干扰工具可用。

Result: 发现推理增强与工具幻觉存在因果关系，这种效应超越过拟合，且与训练方法无关。缓解策略揭示可靠性与能力之间的根本权衡。

Conclusion: 当前推理增强方法本质上会放大工具幻觉，需要新的训练目标来同时优化能力和可靠性。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了谱梯度下降(SpecGD)在数据不平衡情况下的泛化性能，发现相比传统梯度下降，SpecGD能更平衡地学习数据的各个主成分，从而在训练早期获得更好的平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Muon和Shampoo等谱感知矩阵值优化器在深度学习中的广泛应用，需要系统研究其泛化特性，特别是在什么条件下能超越竞争算法。

Method: 使用不平衡数据作为测试平台，研究谱梯度下降(SpecGD)的规范形式，通过高斯混合数据模型和线性/双线性模型进行理论分析，并扩展到深度线性模型。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，SpecGD能平等学习数据的所有主成分，而传统GD优先学习主导主成分，导致SpecGD在训练早期就表现出更好的平衡准确率，且这种优势在深度模型中更加明显。

Conclusion: 谱优化器通过促进数据基础组件的更平衡学习，实现了优越的泛化性能，这在不平衡数据集上特别明显。

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

TL;DR: 语言模型在上下文组合任务中表现不佳，简单的任务示例反而会对性能产生负面影响，因为模型难以正确识别和组装技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在上下文学习中的组合能力，探索如何将基础技能组合完成复合任务，这比标准训练设置更具挑战性。

Method: 对多个开源语言模型进行系统实验，使用语言和逻辑任务来探测组合能力，并通过理论分析验证示例与组合步骤的对齐重要性。

Result: 实验结果显示简单的任务示例会对性能产生负面影响，模型普遍难以正确识别和组装技能，即使使用思维链示例也是如此。

Conclusion: 示例与组合步骤的对齐至关重要，这一洞察为改进探测任务的方法提供了支持，并提升了性能。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络服务数量激增导致相似服务选择困难，现有QoS预测方法难以捕捉丰富上下文信息，在极端数据稀疏和结构噪声下性能不佳。

Method: 集成多阶注意力机制聚合上下文数据，使用对抗神经网络进行自回归监督学习，采用Gumbel-Softmax离散采样技术生成负样本捕获高阶交互。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验验证表明，该模型显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: QoSMGAA模型在复杂噪声网络服务环境中具有强大的实际部署潜力，适用于服务选择和推荐场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technologies, network services have
become critical for delivering diverse and reliable applications to users.
However, the exponential growth in the number of available services has
resulted in many similar offerings, posing significant challenges in selecting
optimal services. Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a
fundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
However, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual
information and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and
structural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,
specifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy
network service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention
mechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values
effectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks
to perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction
matrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and
services, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax
method to generate informative negative samples. Comprehensive experimental
validation conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that our
proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods,
highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in service selection
and recommendation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有等变模型主要局限于旋转等简单对称性，无法处理科学领域中常见的广义线性变换GL(n)对称性，需要开发能够处理更广泛对称性的神经网络架构。

Method: 引入ReLNs架构，设计了伴随不变的双线性层，能够稳定地保持李代数特征和矩阵值输入的等变性，无需为每个子群重新设计。

Result: 在sl(3)和sp(4)对称性的代数基准测试中优于现有方法，在洛伦兹等变粒子物理任务中取得竞争性结果，在3D无人机状态估计中显著提高了轨迹精度。

Conclusion: ReLNs为在李代数和矩阵值数据上学习广泛线性群对称性提供了一个实用且通用的框架。

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

Motivation: 随机森林和XGBoost使用等权重聚合CART树，但不同树在不同输入下的重要性可能不同，需要自适应权重分配

Method: 结合OP2T框架为不同输入分配定制化权重，并使用混合整数优化动态优化权重候选值

Result: 在20多个真实数据集上的二分类和多分类问题中，AF始终优于RF、XGBoost和其他加权RF方法

Conclusion: 自适应权重选择能显著提升集成学习模型的性能

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

Motivation: 为GSPO算法的序列级权重提供信息论解释，帮助理解其经验特性如方差减少和训练稳定性。

Method: 建立GSPO序列权重与信息论量（困惑度比率、交叉熵变化）的数学等价关系，并通过数学推理任务进行实验验证。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为GSPO算法提供了新的理解框架，解释了其几何平均带来的对数域方差减少和专家混合模型训练的稳定性。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型和优化算法的鲁棒性保证及收敛性分析通常假设softmax算子的Lipschitz常数为1，但这一假设可能不够精确。本文旨在提供更精确的softmax Lipschitz常数分析。

Method: 通过理论分析证明softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数（p≥1）下的Lipschitz常数均为1/2，并分析局部Lipschitz常数的性质。同时通过注意力架构（ViT、GPT-2、Qwen3-8B）和强化学习中的随机策略进行实证验证。

Result: 证明了softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数下具有统一的Lipschitz常数1/2，对于p=1和p=∞，局部Lipschitz常数达到1/2；对于p∈(1,∞)，局部常数严格小于1/2，上确界1/2仅在极限情况下达到。

Conclusion: 这是首次对softmax Lipschitz连续性进行的全面范数统一分析，更精确的1/2常数直接改进了现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果，并通过实证研究验证了该常数的尖锐性。

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and
on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PTPP感知的适应缩放定律，将预训练预算作为显式变量，能够准确预测未见PTPP值的适应损失，并在多语言设置中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续预训练缩放定律通常假设固定的预训练预算，这限制了它们预测在不同tokens-per-parameter（PTPP）下训练的模型适应结果的能力。

Method: 开发PTPP感知的适应缩放定律，使预训练预算成为显式变量，并在多语言设置（英语/阿拉伯语→法语）上进行验证。

Result: 在PTPP={15,31}的早期阶段训练的PTPP感知公式能够准确预测PTPP=279时的目标损失，并在指标（Huber-on-log、MAE_rel、校准斜率）上优于PTPP不可知的DCPT传输基线。

Conclusion: PTPP感知缩放定律不仅能够预测适应损失，还能在实际应用中规划回放比率和适应token预算，在计算限制下满足目标和遗忘约束。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,
MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in
the appendix. Beyond forecasting, we show a practical use case: planning replay
ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting
constraints under compute limits.

TL;DR: MoEMeta是一个用于少样本知识图谱关系学习的元学习框架，通过解耦全局共享知识和任务特定上下文，实现了更好的泛化能力和快速适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本知识图谱关系学习方法存在两个关键问题：一是孤立地学习关系元知识，未能捕捉跨任务共享的关系模式；二是难以有效整合对快速适应至关重要的局部任务特定上下文。

Method: 提出MoEMeta框架，包含两个关键创新：(1) 混合专家模型学习全局共享关系原型以增强泛化；(2) 任务定制适应机制捕捉局部上下文以实现快速任务特定适应。

Result: 在三个知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验和分析表明，MoEMeta始终优于现有基线方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过平衡全局泛化与局部适应能力，MoEMeta显著推进了少样本关系学习的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sentinel是一个个性化的联邦入侵检测系统框架，采用双模型架构（个性化教师模型和轻量级共享学生模型），通过双向知识蒸馏、多层面特征对齐和类别平衡损失函数解决联邦学习在物联网入侵检测中的类别不平衡、非IID数据和高通信开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在物联网入侵检测系统应用中面临类别严重不平衡、非IID数据分布和高通信开销的挑战，这些因素显著降低了传统联邦学习方法在网络流量分类中的性能。

Method: 提出Sentinel框架，采用双模型架构：每个客户端包含个性化教师模型和轻量级共享学生模型；集成双向知识蒸馏（带自适应温度缩放）、多层面特征对齐和类别平衡损失函数；服务器端使用归一化梯度聚合和等权重客户端策略。

Result: 在IoTID20和5GNIDD基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，Sentinel显著优于最先进的联邦学习方法，在极端数据异构情况下建立了新的性能基准，同时保持了通信效率。

Conclusion: Sentinel框架有效解决了联邦学习在物联网入侵检测中的关键挑战，通过个性化学习和高效通信机制实现了优越的性能和公平性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了针对动态数据流的近似最近邻搜索和近似核密度估计的亚线性空间草图算法，在流式模型和滑动窗口模型下实现了亚线性内存和查询时间保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模和动态数据流中，设计能够保持数据结构特性同时支持高效查询的紧凑草图是一个核心挑战。

Method: 开发了新的草图算法，在动态数据流中为ANN和A-KDE实现亚线性空间和查询时间保证。对于流式模型中的ANN，设计了亚线性草图；对于滑动窗口模型中的A-KDE，提出了基于LSH的草图结构。

Result: ANN草图仅需存储总输入的亚线性部分，支持亚线性查询时间和批量查询；A-KDE草图在滑动窗口模型中首次实现了理论上的亚线性草图保证。实验表明所提草图轻量且在实践中误差较低。

Conclusion: 这是首个在ANN中实现内存大小与近似误差之间接近最优权衡的结果，也是滑动窗口模型中A-KDE的首个理论亚线性草图保证，为大规模动态数据流处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

Motivation: 构建一个完全可定制和可适应的系统，用于直接从图像翻译文本，不依赖单一的大型预训练模型。

Method: 使用U-Net检测图像中的文本区域，Tesseract提取源文本，然后通过从头训练的Transformer模型在5种语言的多语言平行语料库上进行翻译。

Conclusion: 验证了自定义构建系统用于直接从图像翻译文本的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

TL;DR: CrysLLMGen是一个结合大语言模型和扩散模型的混合框架，用于生成周期性晶体结构，解决了现有方法在原子类型和连续特征建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型各有局限：大语言模型擅长处理离散原子类型但难以处理连续特征（原子位置、晶格参数），而扩散模型擅长连续变量但难以生成准确的原子组成。需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出CrysLLMGen混合框架：首先使用微调的大语言模型生成原子类型、原子坐标和晶格结构的中间表示，然后保留预测的原子类型，将原子坐标和晶格结构传递给预训练的等变扩散模型进行细化。

Result: 在多个基准任务和数据集上优于最先进的生成模型，不仅实现了结构和组成有效性的平衡性能，还生成了比基于LLM和扩散模型更稳定和新颖的材料。

Conclusion: CrysLLMGen成功结合了大语言模型和扩散模型的互补优势，在晶体材料生成方面表现出色，并具有强大的条件生成能力，能够有效满足用户定义的约束。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in
designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely
on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

TL;DR: 本文揭示了两种看似不同的Pass@K目标策略梯度优化方法（直接REINFORCE风格方法和优势塑造技术）实际上是同一枚硬币的两面，通过逆向工程和正向推导建立了它们之间的等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和两种看似不同的Pass@K目标策略梯度优化方法，揭示它们的内在联系，为RLVR策略梯度优化提供更统一的视角。

Method: 通过逆向工程分析现有的优势塑造算法，发现它们隐式地优化了代理奖励；同时从代理奖励目标出发，推导出新的优势塑造方法。

Result: 证明了直接REINFORCE风格方法和优势塑造技术是等价的，将GRPO中的硬样本加权修改解释为奖励级正则化，并提供了推导新优势塑造方法的简单方法。

Conclusion: 这种统一视角为超越Pass@K原始动机的RLVR策略梯度优化提供了新的理论框架和分析工具。

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准掩码扩散模型在离散生成建模中无法有效捕获并发预测token间的依赖关系，当token间依赖重要时会导致生成质量下降。

Method: 引入潜变量到掩码扩散过程中，通过变分推断来显式建模token间的依赖关系。

Result: 在合成数据集、数独谜题和文本数据集上的实验表明，VMD成功学习了传统掩码扩散无法捕获的依赖关系，提高了生成质量和全局一致性。

Conclusion: 将变分推断集成到掩码扩散中具有重要价值，VMD增强了生成质量和依赖感知能力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Conclusion: AirFed在大规模无人机-MEC部署中具有实际应用价值，在不同无人机数量、物联网设备密度和系统规模下均表现出稳健性能。

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

Motivation: 解决在离散状态空间中从非归一化密度采样的挑战，避免需要目标分布样本或计算配分函数。

Method: 基于前向均匀扩散核的连续时间马尔可夫链，利用目标具体分数恒等式，通过蒙特卡洛估计具体分数，并用神经网络近似。提出了两种算法：自归一化TCSIS和无偏TCSIS。

Conclusion: TCSIS提供了一种无需目标分布样本或配分函数计算的有效采样方法，适用于离散状态空间。

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即神经算子性能受限于训练数据的精度，探索神经网络如何通过训练超越其训练数据源的精度限制。

Method: 理论分析归纳偏置、训练目标和数值误差特性的相互作用，并在多种PDE上使用标准神经网络架构进行实证验证。

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常值检测技术往往忽略了领域对象的固有分散性，且大多数聚类基础的异常检测方法仅基于数值分析，未能模拟人类专家的视觉识别方式。

Method: 基于聚类过程的异常值检测方法，设计了四个标准来模拟人类专家在分析聚类后视觉识别异常值的方式。

Result: 在两个不同领域（稳定测量和脑电图）的数据上评估，结果显示假阳性率低于2%，可靠性大于99%，回归分析证实该方法在不同领域检测异常数据有效。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测不同领域的异常数据，具有高可靠性和低假阳性率，优于仅基于数值分析的聚类异常检测技术。

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了感知-决策交错Transformer架构，通过交替的感知和决策层实现反馈机制，结合对比损失对齐文本任务和视觉特征，在BabyAI环境中表现优于标准PPO基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构将感知和决策模块分离，导致策略失败无法直接帮助感知模块学习重要特征，这种分离效率低下。

Method: 实现感知-决策交错Transformer架构，在单一Transformer中交替感知和决策层，集成CLIP启发的对比损失来对齐文本任务嵌入和视觉场景特征。

Result: 在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中评估，该方法获得更稳定的奖励和更强的对齐效果，优于标准PPO基线。

Conclusion: 交错Transformer编码器是开发更集成自主智能体的有前景方向。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于FPGA的能效振动手势识别方案，通过原始波形输入、轻量级网络架构和整数量化优化，在低功耗硬件上实现实时手势识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居接口需求增长，现有振动手势识别方法依赖复杂预处理和大规模神经网络，导致高能耗且难以在实际中部署。

Method: 采用原始波形输入替代复杂频谱预处理，设计两种轻量级网络架构(1D-CNN和1D-SepCNN)，使用整数量化和自动RTL生成，并扩展硬件感知搜索框架。

Result: 在AMD Spartan-7 FPGA上，6位1D-CNN达到0.970平均准确率和9.22ms延迟，8位1D-SepCNN延迟降至6.83ms(比CPU快53倍)，准确率0.949，每次推理能耗低于1.2mJ。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持竞争力的准确率同时，实现了低延迟、高能效的实时手势识别，适合长期边缘部署。

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches
0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit
1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with
slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,
demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了预测性基准测试的构建效度框架，分析了从基准分数推断科学结论所需的理论假设，并通过三个案例研究验证了该框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试是机器学习研究中的核心实践，但仅凭基准分数无法直接支持科学推断，需要明确相关的理论假设和条件。

Method: 借鉴心理学测量理论，开发了构建效度条件框架，并通过ImageNet、WeatherBench和Fragile Families Challenge三个案例研究进行实证分析。

Result: 明确了基准分数支持科学主张所需的具体条件，揭示了基准测试作为认识论实践的理论推理本质。

Conclusion: 预测性基准测试不仅是技术评估工具，更是机器学习中概念和理论推理的关键场所，需要明确的构建效度条件来支持科学推断。

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

TL;DR: 提出一个可扩展的合成数据生成管道，创建包含任务、推理过程、代码和测试的四元组数据集，通过微调LLM显著提升代码生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成数据集缺乏中间推理过程，限制了LLM学习人类解决问题的思维过程。

Method: 结合竞赛问题、网络内容过滤、推理模式引导的数据扩展和多阶段执行验证，使用遗传突变算法增加任务多样性。

Result: 微调LLM在该数据集上在代码基准测试中取得一致改进，推理感知数据可替代模型缩放，在相同样本预算下优于领先开源方案。

Conclusion: 以推理为中心的合成数据生成是提升LLM编码能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that
fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding
benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model
scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source
alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes
reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for
advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation
pipeline to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 提出AC-HQMM模型和RILA算法，解决隐藏量子马尔可夫模型在数据污染和对抗扰动下的鲁棒性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HQMM学习算法对数据污染高度敏感，缺乏对抗扰动的鲁棒性保证机制

Method: 提出AC-HQMM框架，允许部分观测序列被对抗性污染；开发RILA算法，集成RCR-EF模块和迭代随机重采样程序，使用L1惩罚似然目标

Result: 在多个HQMM和HMM基准测试中，RILA表现出优越的收敛稳定性、污染恢复能力和物理有效性保持

Conclusion: RILA为鲁棒量子序列学习提供了一种原则性且高效的方法

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

*Qi Li,Jun Wang*

TL;DR: 提出GCAO聚类算法，通过群体级优化机制解决高维非均匀分布数据中低密度边界样本易受干扰的问题，显著提升聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法在高维和非均匀分布数据中表现不佳，低密度边界样本容易受到邻近簇的干扰，导致聚类结果不稳定和扭曲。

Method: GCAO引入群体级优化机制，将低密度边界点聚合成协作移动的群体，结合局部密度估计和邻域拓扑构建有效的引力相互作用，使用群体作为基本运动单元进行引力收缩。

Result: 在多个高维数据集上的实验表明，GCAO在NMI、ARI、Homogeneity和ACC指标上分别平均提升了37.13%、52.08%、44.98%和38.81%，同时保持了竞争性的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: GCAO在保持簇完整性、增强边界可分性和确保复杂数据分布上的鲁棒性能方面具有优越性。

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的时间序列分割评估指标：WARI（加权调整兰德指数）和SMS（状态匹配分数），用于解决现有评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割评估方法主要关注变化点准确性或使用点基指标如调整兰德指数，这些方法无法捕捉分割段质量、忽略错误性质且解释性有限。

Method: 开发了WARI来考虑分割错误的位置，以及SMS来识别和评分四种基本类型的分割错误，同时允许错误特定加权。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中验证了WARI和SMS，表明它们不仅提供更准确的分割质量评估，还能揭示传统方法无法获取的错误来源和类型等洞察。

Conclusion: WARI和SMS为时间序列分割提供了更全面和可解释的评估框架，能够更好地理解分割算法的性能。

Abstract: Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data
across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring.
While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this
problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited.
Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on
point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture
the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer
limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by
introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index),
that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching
Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental
types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We
empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation
quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are
inaccessible with traditional measures.

TL;DR: PAHQ是一种加速自动电路发现的新方法，通过注意力头量化技术，在保持分析忠实度的同时显著降低计算时间和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动电路发现方法（ACDC）在大语言模型中存在计算效率低和内存需求高的问题，现有加速方法主要依赖线性近似，这会显著损害分析忠实度。

Method: PAHQ采用注意力头量化方法，将激活修补与混合精度量化对齐，仅对研究组件保持高精度，同时在网络其他部分安全降低精度。

Result: PAHQ加速的ACDC相比未加速版本，运行时间减少高达80%，内存消耗降低高达30%，同时保持忠实度。

Conclusion: PAHQ提供了一种无需训练的新颖实用途径来加速机械可解释性方法，并能与现有的基于边的电路发现技术无缝集成。

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAMPE是一个统一的多模态蛋白质嵌入框架，通过最优传输表示对齐和条件图生成融合方法，解决了蛋白质功能预测中的跨模态分布不匹配和噪声关系图问题，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合异质的内在信号（如序列和结构）和噪声的外在上下文（如蛋白质相互作用和GO注释），但存在两个关键挑战：预训练编码器产生的嵌入存在跨模态分布不匹配，以及外在数据的噪声关系图会降低GNN的信息聚合效果。

Method: 提出DAMPE框架，包含两个核心机制：1）基于最优传输的表示对齐，建立不同模态内在嵌入空间之间的对应关系；2）基于条件图生成的信息融合方法，其中条件编码器融合对齐的内在嵌入为图重构提供信息线索。理论分析表明CGG目标驱动条件编码器将图感知知识吸收到蛋白质表示中。

Result: 在标准GO基准测试中，DAMPE优于或匹配DPFunc等最先进方法，AUPR提升0.002-0.013个百分点，Fmax提升0.004-0.007个百分点。消融研究显示OT对齐贡献0.043-0.064 pp AUPR，CGG融合贡献0.005-0.111 pp Fmax。

Conclusion: DAMPE为稳健的多模态蛋白质表示学习提供了一个可扩展且理论基础扎实的方法，显著增强了蛋白质功能预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数等变神经网络依赖于单一的全局对称性，限制了它们在对称性是局部而非全局的领域中的应用。

Method: 引入Torsor CNN框架，使用边势（相邻坐标系之间的群值变换）编码局部对称性，建立与群同步问题的等价性，提出Torsor卷积层和挫折损失作为几何正则化器。

Result: 该框架在任意图上运行，不需要全局坐标系或光滑流形结构，适用于多视角3D识别等任务。

Conclusion: Torsor CNN为局部对称性学习提供了数学基础和实用框架，统一了多种现有架构。

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials -- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss -- a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures -- including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds
-- by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate
system or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations
of this framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D
recognition, where relative camera poses naturally define the required edge
potentials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常从单个轨迹推断微分方程，未能充分利用同一系统的多个观测轨迹。MIO旨在通过多实例学习利用重复观测来提高动态系统建模的泛化能力。

Method: 结合Transformer架构和多实例学习，采用不同的实例聚合策略（如简单均值聚合），从多个轨迹中学习符号常微分方程。

Result: 在1到4维系统及不同噪声水平下进行评估，MIO始终优于现有基线方法，即使简单均值聚合也能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: MIO通过有效利用多个观测轨迹，显著提升了符号常微分方程推断的性能和泛化能力，为动态系统建模提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a
dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with
transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of
the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation
strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预测编码（PC）作为反向传播（BP）的替代算法，通过优化理论深入分析了PC的推理和学习动态，提出了新的参数化方法μPC，首次实现了100+层网络的稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播（BP）虽然有效但能耗高且不太可能在大脑中实现，因此需要研究更高效、更符合大脑工作原理的替代算法。预测编码（PC）作为一种脑启发算法，具有潜在优势但深层网络难以训练。

Method: 采用基于优化理论的理论分析方法，将PC学习动态理解为近似信任域方法，研究PC使用高阶信息的能力，并提出新的参数化方法μPC来稳定深层网络训练。

Result: PC可以近似使用二阶信息，理论上能利用任意高阶信息，有效学习景观比损失景观更良性且对梯度消失更鲁棒。μPC首次实现了100+层网络的稳定训练，在简单任务上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该论文显著推进了对PCN推理和学习动态的基本理解，但PC要与BP在大规模应用上竞争，未来研究需要关注硬件协同设计。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种块对角LoRA方法，通过约束LoRA因子为块对角结构，实现无需额外通信的适配器分片，显著提升了多适配器服务时的端到端速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决S-LoRA在多设备设置中存在的通信开销问题，特别是在实际应用中可能较大的通信延迟。

Method: 约束LoRA因子为块对角结构，使LoRA适配器分片与基础模型的张量并行执行对齐，无需额外通信。

Result: 在8个A100 GPU上，Llama-3.1-70B获得最高1.79倍端到端加速，Llama-3.1-8B获得最高1.63倍端到端加速，同时保持与标准LoRA相似的参数效率。

Conclusion: 块对角LoRA方法在保持参数效率的同时，显著降低了多适配器服务的通信开销，实现了优于S-LoRA的性能表现。

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可学习Sigmoid算子的乘法更新近端梯度算法(SSO-PGA)，用于解决非负逆问题中传统PGA的稳定性差和违反非负约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近端梯度算法(PGA)在图像重建等逆问题中经常产生不稳定收敛和次优解，主要原因是梯度下降步骤会引入负值并导致对超参数的高度敏感性。

Method: 用可学习的Sigmoid基算子替代梯度下降步骤，将传统的减法更新转换为乘法更新，强制实施非负性和有界性；通过滑动参数增强稳定性和收敛性；将优化算法展开为深度网络。

Result: 广泛的数值和真实世界实验表明，该方法显著优于传统PGA和其他最先进算法，确保了优异的性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: SSO-PGA算法通过乘法更新机制有效解决了非负逆问题中的约束违反问题，结合了优化的可解释性和深度学习的强大能力。

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

Abstract: Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) is vital for disaster prevention but
remains challenging in data-scarce regions where hydrodynamic models require
dense geophysical inputs. This work introduces ZeroFlood, a geospatial
foundation model framework for data-efficient FSM. The approach fine-tunes
Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) with Thinking-in-Modality (TiM) reasoning,
enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1

regions, ZeroFlood bridges data availability gaps through cross-modal
representation learning. Experiments with TerraMind and Prithvi GFMs show that
TiM enhances model robustness, with the TerraMind-Large configuration achieving
an F1 score of 67.21. The results demonstrate the feasibility of
foundation-model-based FSM as a scalable and data-efficient solution for flood

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of
materials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific,
requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a
generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties
spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or
exceeding a commercial coolant. These results establish GATE as a ready-to-use,
generalizable AI platform readily applicable across diverse materials discovery
tasks.

Conclusion: SNG成功结合了符号和神经方法的互补优势，在药物设计等应用中展示了实用价值，特别是在目标理解不充分的情况下，能够生成有前景的候选分子。

Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic
models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR在单次生成问题解决中取得成功，但强化学习微调过程会损害模型的探索能力，导致生成多样性下降，从而在大N值的Best-of-N采样中性能退化。

Method: 推导了直接优化max@k指标的无偏策略梯度估计，并扩展到离策略更新以提高样本效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在离策略场景下有效优化了max@k指标，使模型与Best-of-N推理策略保持一致。

Conclusion: 提出的目标函数成功解决了RLVR导致的多样性下降问题，优化了max@k性能指标。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

TL;DR: 提出了Eigen-Value (EV)框架，一种用于OOD鲁棒性的即插即用数据估值方法，仅使用ID数据子集，通过谱逼近域差异来估计每个数据点对OOD鲁棒性的边际贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据估值方法基于ID损失，无法泛化到OOD场景，且OOD感知方法计算成本高，阻碍实际部署。

Method: 使用ID数据协方差矩阵的特征值比率来谱逼近域差异，通过扰动理论估计每个数据点对该差异的边际贡献，无需额外训练循环即可集成到基于ID损失的方法中。

Result: EV在真实数据集上实现了改进的OOD鲁棒性和稳定的价值排名，同时保持计算轻量级。

Conclusion: EV为具有域偏移的大规模设置提供了实用的OOD鲁棒数据估值方法，计算效率高。

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by

  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide
set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with
task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

Conclusion: 提出的新误差度量方法能够在噪声环境下构建更小的核心集，并提供比传统度量方法更紧的真实聚类成本保证，在理论和实践中都表现出优越性。

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by
quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the
output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN
departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

Result: 证明了差分隐私可以作为"额外收益"获得，无需人工噪声；推导出了收敛的隐私边界和一般平滑非凸损失函数的收敛边界；揭示了在不影响训练的情况下实现差分隐私的明确条件。

Conclusion: 自然信道噪声足以提供差分隐私保护，无需额外的人工噪声注入，这为无线联邦学习的隐私保护提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

Conclusion: ADPrompt框架有效提升了预训练GNN模型在下游任务中的公平性，同时保持良好的模型性能。

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BBOPlace-Bench，这是首个专门用于评估和开发芯片布局黑盒优化算法的基准测试，集成了三种问题表述和多种优化算法，实验表明进化算法在高维搜索空间中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 芯片布局对芯片设计质量有重大影响，但缺乏专门针对黑盒优化的统一基准测试来评估不同问题表述和算法。

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available
at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

*Julie Mordacq,David Loiseaux,Vicky Kalogeiton,Steve Oudot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T-REGS是一种基于最小生成树长度的自监督学习正则化框架，能同时缓解维度塌缩并促进表示分布的均匀性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习需要避免维度塌缩（特征仅占据低维子空间）并增强表示分布的均匀性，现有方法难以同时解决这两个关键问题。

Method: 提出T-REGS框架，利用学习表示上最小生成树（MST）的长度作为正则化项，理论上证明该方法能在任意紧致黎曼流形上同时缓解维度塌缩和促进分布均匀性。

Result: 在合成数据和经典自监督学习基准测试上的实验验证了该方法在提升表示质量方面的有效性。

Conclusion: T-REGS提供了一个简单而有效的正则化框架，能够同时解决自监督学习中的维度塌缩和分布均匀性问题，为表示学习提供了新的理论保证和实践方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often consume excessive tokens, inflating
computational cost and latency. We challenge the assumption that longer
responses improve accuracy. By penalizing reasoning tokens using a discounted
reinforcement learning setup (interpretable as a small token cost) and
analyzing Blackwell optimality in restricted policy classes, we encourage
concise yet accurate reasoning. Experiments confirm our theoretical results
that this approach shortens chains of thought while preserving accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了RGA KANs来解决深度cPIKANs的训练不稳定问题，通过新的初始化方案和残差门控架构，在多个PDE基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Chebyshev物理信息KANs（cPIKANs）存在训练不稳定问题，限制了其在多个PDE问题中的应用，需要解决这一可扩展性挑战。

Method: 提出基础无关的Glorot-like初始化方案保持激活方差，并引入受PirateNet启发的残差门控自适应KANs（RGA KANs）架构。

Result: RGA KANs在7个标准前向PDE基准测试中持续优于参数匹配的cPIKANs和PirateNets，通常高出几个数量级，且在其它方法发散时保持稳定。

Conclusion: RGA KANs通过改进初始化和架构设计，成功解决了深度cPIKANs的训练不稳定问题，为物理信息机器学习提供了更可靠和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

Conclusion: DFNMF提供了一种有效平衡公平性与效用的端到端解决方案，具有透明性和可扩展性优势。

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

Motivation: 复杂算法中多个参数存在内在依赖关系（如先确定算子类型再确定算子参数），但现有方法未考虑这种依赖关系，导致结果欠佳。

Method: 提出序列多代理动态算法配置框架Seq-MADAC，采用序列优势分解网络来利用动作顺序信息进行优势分解。

Result: 从合成函数到多目标优化算法配置的实验表明，Seq-MADAC优于最先进的多代理强化学习方法，并在问题类别间表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Seq-MADAC为广泛依赖感知的自动化算法配置建立了新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

TL;DR: TAMI是一个处理时序图链接预测中异质性问题的框架，通过时间编码函数和链接历史聚合来改进现有方法，在多个数据集上显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图链接预测中存在自然异质性：少数节点对产生大多数交互事件，交互间隔时间变化大。现有方法未考虑这种异质性，导致对不频繁交互节点对的预测效果不佳。

Method: 提出TAMI框架，包含两个核心组件：对数时间编码函数(LTE)将交互间隔转换为更平衡的表示；链接历史聚合(LHA)防止节点对历史交互被遗忘。可无缝集成到现有时序图神经网络中。

Result: 在13个经典数据集和3个最新TGB数据集上的实验表明，TAMI在转导和归纳设置下都能持续提升底层模型的链接预测性能。

Conclusion: TAMI通过有效处理时序交互的异质性，显著改善了时序图链接预测的性能，特别是对不频繁交互节点对的预测效果。

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Alleinx/TAMI_temporal_graph.

TL;DR: DPO-PRO：一种基于DPO的鲁棒微调算法，通过轻量级分布鲁棒优化解决偏好数据中的噪声问题，避免过度保守且计算开销小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO方法对数据噪声敏感且容易过拟合，现有DRO方法存在过度保守和计算成本高的问题，需要一种更高效的鲁棒优化方案

Method: 提出DPO-PRO算法，基于DPO框架，通过轻量级DRO公式处理偏好分布的不确定性，仅关注偏好不确定性，避免不必要的保守性

Result: 实验表明DPO-PRO在标准对齐基准和真实公共卫生任务中，相比现有DPO变体能持续提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调方法，相当于正则化DPO目标，惩罚模型在弱偏好信号下的过度自信，计算开销可忽略

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.
