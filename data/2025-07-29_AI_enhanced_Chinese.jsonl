At low Froude and high Bond\nnumbers, conditions relevant to geophysical and astrophysical flows, we\nidentify a novel transition in the fastest growing mode: from Kelvin Helmholtz\n(KH) instability at high density ratio (delta = 0.9), to Holmboe (H)\ninstability as delta approaches 0.5, and ultimately to the Miles (1957)\ncritical layer instability as delta approaches 0.001, representative of the air\nwater system. Remarkably, the Miles mode, characterized by a sharp jump in\ninviscid Reynolds stress (tau) at the critical layer, persists up to delta =\n0.01, i.e., ten times the air water value. As delta increases, the vertical\nvariation of tau undergoes a qualitative change, from a sharp jump at the\ncritical layer for delta much less than 1 to a smooth transition through it for\ndelta greater than or equal to 0.5. A theoretical explanation is provided. In\nthe moderate to high density ratio regime, comparison with a piecewise-linear\n(PL) velocity profile confirms the presence of both H and KH instabilities in\nthe exponential profile. Nonlinear simulations of the incompressible Euler\nequations with gravity and surface tension show excellent agreement with linear\ntheory for delta = 0.01 up to five wave periods. At delta = 0.1, waves saturate\ninto finite-amplitude structures with capillary ripples, while at delta = 0.5,\nthe waves develop sheared cusps and emit spume, resembling asymmetric Holmboe\nwaves observed experimentally. At delta = 0.9, the waves rapidly evolve into\nclassic KH spirals. Comparisons with the PL profile highlight the role of\nbackground curvature and the critical layer.

The convective dynamics is\ncompared in homogeneous, horizontally stratified, vertically stratified, and\nlog-normally distributed permeability fields. Key variables, such as the total\namount of product, mixing length, front position and width, reaction and scalar\ndissipation rates, and dissolution fluxes, are strongly influenced by the type\nof permeability heterogeneity. Vertically stratified and log-normally\ndistributed permeability fields lead to larger values for all parameters\ncompared to homogeneous fields. Horizontally stratified fields act as an\nobstacle to convective flow, resulting in slower front progression, thicker\nfingers, wider reaction fronts, and the lowest dissolution fluxes among all\ncases. When the reaction stabilizes convection, flow stagnation occurs near the\nextremum of the non-monotonic density profile, even in vertically stratified\nsystems, highlighting the complex interaction between reactions and\ndissolution-driven convection. In log-normally distributed fields, the flow\nbehavior depends on the permeability structure: smaller horizontal correlation\nlengths cause fingers to spread more horizontally, while larger horizontal\ncorrelation lengths promote more vertical movement with shorter wavelengths.\nOverall, a shorter horizontal correlation length relative to the vertical one\nleads to an increase in the value of all aforementioned parameters and thus to\na more efficient mixing. These findings reveal how heterogeneity affects\nconvective dynamics by influencing the reaction front, dissolution rates,\nmixing behavior, and mass transport efficiency, emphasizing the intricate role\nof permeability structure in reactive convective processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u975e\u5747\u8d28\u6027\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u6d6e\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u5bf9\u6d41\u6eb6\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u975e\u5747\u8d28\u6027\u5bf9\u6eb6\u89e3\u901a\u91cf\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u524d\u6cbf\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u975e\u5747\u8d28\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u5bf9\u6d41\u6eb6\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7269\u8d28\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6bd4\u8f83\u5747\u8d28\u3001\u6c34\u5e73\u5206\u5c42\u3001\u5782\u76f4\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5782\u76f4\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u573a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6eb6\u89e3\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u6c34\u5e73\u5206\u5c42\u573a\u963b\u788d\u5bf9\u6d41\u3002\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u4e2d\uff0c\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u957f\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u6d41\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u975e\u5747\u8d28\u6027\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u53cd\u5e94\u524d\u6cbf\u3001\u6eb6\u89e3\u901f\u7387\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u5bf9\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u5bf9\u6d41\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In this study, a data-driven methodology is presented for the\nprediction of hydrodynamic forces acting on spherical particles immersed in an\nambient flow field, where neighboring particle information is represented by\nvolume fractions.

The degrees of freedom defined by moments of normal\nderivatives are modified to align with the dual basis of the Bernstein\npolynomials, yielding structured local bases on each simplex. Explicit basis\nconstruction is essential not merely for completeness, but for enabling\nefficient matrix assembly, global continuity, and scalable solution of\nhigh-order elliptic partial differential equations.

The framework is evaluated across five\nrepresentative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:\nbanking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets\nand LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional\ndependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the\nnon-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger\ngains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while\nalso reducing average token usage, without any additional training.", "AI": {"tldr": "WARPP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6d89\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "WARPP\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u526a\u679d\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cWARPP\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WARPP\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e0b\u7684LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Tip vortices can lead to flow loss, noise, vibration and cavitation in\nhydrodynamic systems. We propose and develop a grooved-tip design, featuring\nmultiple grooves distributed along the wing tip to alter the tip vortex\nstructure and dynamics. Four grooved-tip designs, including tilted and\nshrinking grooves, were experimentally investigated. Streamwise and cross-flow\nParticle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were employed to visualise the\nflow fields near the wing tip and along the primary tip vortex trajectory. The\nPIV results demonstrate that the grooved-tip designs significantly reduce the\nvelocity magnitude within the primary tip vortex. This velocity deficit is\nattributed to the decreased suction within the vortex core. Furthermore,\ncross-flow PIV measurements reveal that the tip separation vortex is\nsubstantially suppressed, and the strength of the primary tip vortex is\nsignificantly mitigated. Downstream of the wing, the grooved tips lead to a\nreduction in vortex swirling strength and an enlargement of the vortex\ndimensions, suggesting enhanced diffusion and a reduction of the pressure drop\nof approximately 40%. Our findings highlight the potential of these grooved-tip\ndesigns to effectively modify tip vortex behaviour and mitigate the pressure\ndrop within the tip vortex region, with negligible changes to the lift and drag\nperformance.

To simulate\nrandom perturbations arising from manufacturing defects and surface wear in\nreal-world grating profiles, we propose a stochastic surface modeling framework\nmotivated by the discretization of the Wiener process. Our approach introduces\nrandomness at discrete nodes and then applies linear interpolation to construct\nthe surface, marking a novel attempt to incorporate the concepts of the Wiener\nprocess into random surface representation. Under this framework, each\nrealization of the random surface generates a Lipschitz-continuous diffraction\ngrating, mathematically represented as a sum of a baseline profile and a\nweighted linear combination of local `tent' basis functions, meanwhile\npreserving key statistics of the random surface. Building on this\nrepresentation, we introduce the Recursive Parametric Smoothing Strategy (RPSS)\nto invert the key statistics of our random surfaces. Combined with Monte Carlo\nsampling and a wavenumber continuation strategy, our reconstruction scheme\ndemonstrates effectiveness across multiple benchmark scenarios.

To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including\nthe limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame\nlanguages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and\nagent-agent misalignment.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and\ntarget region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for\nsubgraph matching in large-scale circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b50\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff08EDA\uff09\u548c\u7535\u8def\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u76ee\u6807\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u5b50\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f4e\u6548\u5339\u914d\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528GNN\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7535\u8def\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6574\u4e2a\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5b50\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, differences\nbetween structures will mean the training and testing distributions will\ndiffer; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to\ngeneralise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),\ncan be used to leverage information across related domains. An important\nconsideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based\nmetrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.\nThus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is\nto identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for\nwhich the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.\nGenerally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain\nexpertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on\nthe dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,\nknowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal\nassurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the\nmodes of healthy structures.

In fact, as of now there have been about only\n5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning\n(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,\ncapable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its\naccuracy by learning.

In an effort to reduce such complexities, in\nthis paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known\nML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models\nthat are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest\nneighbors, and random forest.

In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss\nfunction and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the\nmodel parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and\ninverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with\nresiduals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and\nthen expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex\ndifferential equations.

Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level\ninstance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)\nseparately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate\na surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation\n(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical\ninstruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach\nand introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object\nqueries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In\norder to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and\npart-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS\nto learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes.

However, existing models primarily\nfocus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,\nrestricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In\nthis paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by\nintroducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for\ninput and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users\nto interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose\nSTOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates\narbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames\nwithin a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric\nvideo instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require\nreasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other\nexisting benchmarks across video question answering and referring object\nsegmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed\nmodel consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and\nsegmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video\nand image understanding.

In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal\ncontrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs\ncross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar\nfeatures and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.\nOn Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass\ndetection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16\npercentage points.

Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was\nhigh (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference\nwith the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT\n(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels\non par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT\nsupervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for\nlarge-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u4eceMRI/CT\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u80f0\u817a\u56ca\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\uff08PCL\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-4o\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6PCL\u7279\u5f81\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o\u751f\u6210\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff08LLaMA\u548cDeepSeek\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540eLLM\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08LLaMA 80%\u219297%\uff0cDeepSeek 79%\u219298%\uff09\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7bF1\u5206\u6570\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-4o\uff080.95-0.97\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u7ed3\u5408CoT\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684PCL\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8eGPT-4o\u3002"}}

Following two successful green hydrogen project\nrounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While\nthis area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to\nenvironmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite\ngrowing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,\nwith major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence\nproduction until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This\nabsence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale\nhydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for\naccurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.\nGiven this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and\nreliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because\nharsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity\nfluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable\nenergy systems.

We present SynPAIN, a\nlarge-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355\nneutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:\n20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we\ncreated demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically\nmeaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain\nexpressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than\nneutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment\ntools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate\nSynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection\nmodels. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial\nperformance disparities across demographic characteristics.

Recent approaches have\nattempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods\noften require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in\nlength and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present\nlong-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an\neffortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can\nmarkedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling\nshort instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate\nresponses based on long-context meta-instructions.

However, it often produces\nbrittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious\nreasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified\ntheoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.\nThis paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the\nstability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism.

The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by\nOrszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of\nnumerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that\nturbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very\nsensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In\nphysics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out\nby Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent\nKolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with\nthat given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal\ntrajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly\npolluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has\nhuge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and\nthe energy cascade but also even in statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u2018\u6e05\u6d01\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u2019\uff08CNS\uff09\u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4Kolmogorov\u6e4d\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff08DNS\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DNS\u7ed3\u679c\u53d7\u6570\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6e4d\u6d41\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u6570\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e09\u7ef4\u6e4d\u6d41\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CNS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u622a\u65ad\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u820d\u5165\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "result": "DNS\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u6d41\u573a\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea7\u8054\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0eCNS\u57fa\u51c6\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ef4\u6e4d\u6d41\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cCNS\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u89e3\u3002"}}

A,\n185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling\ndata as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods\nhave proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)\nimproves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments\nappropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of\nMM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods\nimpractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are\nrequired. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it\nadditionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these\nbottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a\nbalance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical\nstability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly\nseparated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a\ncomputationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the\nDGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We\nimplement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of\nDGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while\nrequiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM.

This paper introduces Face\nRetouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring\noriginal faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional\nimage restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with\nvarious types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the\nlow-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nMoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert\nisolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts\nhandling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert\ndealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a\ndual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an\nIterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based\nHigh-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement.

Leveraging\nLLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling\nchoice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they\ntruly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of\nfully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural\nlanguage processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific\nand exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The\nneed for building legal text processing applications for different natural\nlanguages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge\nfor legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity\nof resources and annotated data.

The\nscale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in\nparameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize\nthat while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to\nemergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in\nthe activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,\nto circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction\nsignificantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation\nengineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical\ninsights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden\ndimensions.

Despite advances\nin language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs\nperform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for\nagents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this\ngap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure\nspatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our\nmethodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of\nvarying complexity ($5\\times 5$ to $15\\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate\nfeedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test\nfundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across\nidentical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic\ntransfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while\nOpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\\times 30$,\nother models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\\times 9$ mazes, with 100%\nof failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a\ncell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in\nIcelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,\nsuggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather\nthan language-agnostic mechanisms.

First, we focus\non data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into\nand retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our\nmodels make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to\nbecome more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural\narchitecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers.

However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations\nexhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align\nwell with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a\ndouble-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of\nvarying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.\n  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and\nanalyze their utility across diverse DNNs.

These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number\n(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of\nthese fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between\ntwo attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention\n(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, \"query\nambiguity\" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both\none-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's\none-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,\na more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in\nimages. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query\nparadigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.\nFurthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention\ndisentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many\nprocess), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),\naddressing \"query ambiguity\" and \"ROT\" issues directly, and enhancing decoder\nefficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size\npriors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.\nExtensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and\nWiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of\nDS-Det.

To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class\nwithout human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of\nimages and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled\nby text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these\nworks do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and\nthus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or\nthe training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In\nthis work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,\nfrom which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.\nIn particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object\nlocalization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region\nexpansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the\nsemantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively\nspread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale\nself-attention maps.

Second, by early\nchecking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a\nlightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the\nflagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines\nboundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.\nWe validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and\npost-rainfall PlanetScope composites.

Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact\nunlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high\ntraining costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to\nKGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove\ntargeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from\nremaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which\nweakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these\nissues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on\ndirect preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting\ntriples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the\nmodel is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original\nforgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable\nknowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.\nMoreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct\npreference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection\nbetween forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary\nknowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills\nrelevant information both within and across time steps.

This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and\nbody gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a\ncombination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)\nmethods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then\nalign variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based\napproaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error\npropagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary\nscalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck.

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

In realistic reasoning\nscenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving\nprocesses. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'\nintrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in\nmulti-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced\nPolicy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training\nmulti-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that\nLLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in\nthe entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following\ninteractions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO\nincorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing\nglobal trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting\nexploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an\nadvantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage\ndifferences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13\nchallenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and\ndeep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL\nalgorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of\nthe tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution\nfor aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments.

By training the\nmodel to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely\ncapturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal\nrepresentation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning\ntasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench\ndataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a\ncritical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CWMI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Causal World Model Induction\uff08CWMI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bCausal Physics Module\uff08CPM\uff09\u548cCausal Intervention Loss\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "CWMI\u5728PIQA\u548cPhysiCa-Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LLM\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bf1\u5bfc\u56e0\u679c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

Second, the curved pattern\ndeminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the\nBayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a\nBayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,\nRestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing\npattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the\naverage share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time\nthan the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines.

However, one\nkey question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via\nAI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and\nhealth behaviors?

To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term\nscenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,\nit is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to\nutilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and\ntextual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align\nonly with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states\nare constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is\nintractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers\n(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our\nexperiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain\nto the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In\nthis work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain\nmultimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive\nTarget-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.\nSpecifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal\nvisual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely\nvisual cues.

However, relying solely on gradient information, these\nmethods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,\nplateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for\nlocating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel\nframework to escape saddle points in neural network training.

Project page: https://dejian-lc.github.io/humansam/", "summary": "Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric\nones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human\ninformation security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary\nforgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery\ntypes raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which\nare critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we\npropose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges\nof video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify\nhuman-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly\nobserved in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To\nbetter capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal\nconsistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing\ntwo branches of video understanding and spatial depth.

Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are\nusually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have\nbeen widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their\nsuperior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the\nreal-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear\nself-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this\nissue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for\nits adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,\nparticularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose\nMambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.\nOur MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a\nbifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the\ntexture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging\nconvolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range\ndependencies with linear complexity.

Existing methods typically demand substantial training\nsamples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios.

To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve\ndetection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial\naggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.\nComplementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts\nthat generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on\nauxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates\nstrong zero-shot detection capability.

Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed\nfor investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of\nlinguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available\nEnglish, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on\ntheir diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We\npresent a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth\nerror analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted\nthat there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a\nstandard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we\nformulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the\nevaluation diagnostics benchmarks: \"Why do not we have an evaluation standard\nfor the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?\" similar to ISO standard in\nindustry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered\nlinguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy\nfor linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for\ndiagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing\nthe results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00NLU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76NLU\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709NLU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u7403\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u547d\u540d\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u73b0\u8c61\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5efa\u7acb\u7c7b\u4f3cISO\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684NLU\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks\nhave emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language\nunderstanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches\noften rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating\nnatural language into formal logic representations.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based\nJoint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework\nfor converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing\ninspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by\nefficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as\nSystem 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the\nNL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework\ncomprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and\nSpearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical\ntranslation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.\n  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA\nachieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational\noverhead compared to larger LLM-based systems.

Vision Mamba employs\none-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global\ndependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch\ntokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a\nlow-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information\nCapture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation\n(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose\nFaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through\ntwo complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)\nrestores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing\nmulti-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A\nSelf-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level\nreconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial\ncorrelations, enhancing both fine textures and global context.

In this paper,\nwe propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt\nAdaptation (LPA).

It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain\nto a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label\ndistribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for\nIS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated\nby IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture\ndistribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be\nconnected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build\nIS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence\ncriterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the\ncomputation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels.

To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform\nintensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.\nComparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label\n(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves\nbetter accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the\napplication of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to\nbenefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMo-DsCC\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u690d\u7269\u79cd\u7c7b\u548c\u75c5\u5bb3\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u519c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u690d\u7269\u79cd\u7c7b\u4e0e\u75c5\u5bb3\u7c7b\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cMo-DsCC\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684VGG-16\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u94fe\u5806\u53e0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Plant Village\u548cPlantDoc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMo-DsCC\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Mo-DsCC\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u519c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Accurate property prediction\nfor polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.\nHowever, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by\nthe constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,\nsince the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,\nwe propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training\nframework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and\nintegrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\nFrom the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)\nand graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, \"star linking\"\nstrategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,\na common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)\ntest. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the\ncapability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences.

To\nhelp address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks\n(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international\nbenchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and\nclassify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained\nexplanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels.

Although some methods\nintegrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player\nidentities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent\nof the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt\ngeneration network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which\nfocuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.\nSpecifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is\ndesigned to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a\nplayer identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player\nnames, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player\nfeatures with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual\ncontext learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context\ninformation. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the\nmultimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the\ngeneration of descriptions with player identities.

Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for\ncompatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data\nsynthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges\nregarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,\nwe propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data.

The proposed technique leverages a few\npre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in\na single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted\nTransformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes\nattention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,\nallowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the\nlearned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just\na few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster\nthe rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show\nthat our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any\npre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few\nclustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the\nstate-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and\nscalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to\nexisting clustering techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u590d\u6742\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u6216\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Prior-Data Fitted Transformer Network\uff08PFN\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u9884\u805a\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u9884\u805a\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image\nsegmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.\nHowever, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when\napplied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods\ntypically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks\nand leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.\nHowever, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due\nto constraints in their feature extraction techniques.

A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform\npreviously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating\nparameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research\nhas actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus\non relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.\nTo advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more\ncomplex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire\nin-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise\ndynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token\nand its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually\nconverge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and\nexhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques\nthat explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate\nL-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify\nthat the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor\ngoverning the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these\ninsights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a\nthreshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction\nerror.

A particular\nadvantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization\nterms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in\npractice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity\nand equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the\nre-weighted covariance matrix.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

Inspired by \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" which characterizes\ntwo distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and\nSystem 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that\ndifferent \"subregions\" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for\ntasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step\nlogical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework\nthat partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using\nfewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task\ndata via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on\nimportance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training\nSystem 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and\nintuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to\nreinforce deeper logical deliberation next.

Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or\nstandard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification\n(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly\naligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a\nsuperior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a\nDiffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through\na self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the\nfundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and\nstructural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation.

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively.

This approach is applied to a multilayer\nperceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established\nmethod based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical\nsolutions near nonlinearities.

Statistical models based on\nwell-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses\nabout empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical\nmodels like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as\nthe independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the\nparameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known\nfor the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to\ntheir high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not\nbeen widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the\nchallenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on\npooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural\nnetwork that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical\nobservations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele\nfrequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on\nsimulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the\ndistribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the\nrepresentational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned\nrepresentations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible\nin Pool-Seq data.

Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand\ngestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &\nmute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human\ninteraction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant\nbarriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation\ntechnologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the\nIndian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine\nlearning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf\n& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL\nare less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a\nrobust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &\ndemonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of\n99.95%.

The system's effectiveness is\nrigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1\nscore, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world\napplications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe\nfor precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of\ndynamic gestures.

Due to the impressive general\nmultimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,\nexisting work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text\ntasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In\ncurrent video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of\nthe video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.\nTherefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations\ncan result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.\nIn this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic\nrepresentations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment\nrather than aligning the entire representation.

While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also\nsupporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control.

GACL sees feature\nmagnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be\nsimultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with\ntheoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We\nfurther demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first\ntime enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL\nnot only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also\nextends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment\n(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as\ngeneral-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in\nvertical problems such as noisy label cleansing.

This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic\nframework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased\ndirection per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed\nduring inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.\nTrained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing\ndirection, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased\nsubspaces.

Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations.

Ren", "Jinjin Gu", "Chao Dong"], "title": "Harnessing Diffusion-Yielded Score Priors for Image Restoration", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image\nspace to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:\nremoving degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level\nconsistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including\nMSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to\nachieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We\npropose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution\npipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration\nmodel with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with\nadversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative\nsampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that\ninitializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions\nthe initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.\nConsequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode\ncollapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial\ntraining.

The multiscale\ntemporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of\nlabeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging\nresearch problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture\ncalled the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),\nwhich is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient\nanomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and\ncomplementary information. The main processing path of this framework\nintegrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the\nConvolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained\nrepresentation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features\nthrough a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature\nfusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy\ndistribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention\nmapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a\ncontrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic\nalignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order\nsemantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete\ninference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level\nsemantic concepts.

The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal\nperformance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight\nbenchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV\nalone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,\nachieving performance comparable to attention-based methods.

To ensure smoothness and correct color\nordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap\nrepresentation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.\nWe evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset\nand a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --\ncolormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to\nvisualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color\npalettes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece2D\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u7eed\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u8272\u5f69\u56fe\u4f8b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u5f202D\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u7eed\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u79bb\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u548c\u989c\u8272\u987a\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6VIS30K\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e26\u6709\u8272\u5f69\u56fe\u4f8b\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002"}}

Project page:\n  https://jacky1128.github.io/RepMTL/", "summary": "Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary\nknowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques\nremain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and\ngradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios.

Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits\npractical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image\ncomposition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural\nstylization and seamless compositions.

It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable\nstylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark\ndataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the\nlack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD\nmetric by 18.1%.

However,\nexisting methods primarily focus on designing and combining various\nperturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within\nthe framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical\ndeficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation\nbias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of\nsupervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak\nconsistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and\nprototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework.

Despite its importance, there is currently no\npublicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration\nin UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and\nevaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To\nbridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically\ntailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This\ndataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely\nregistered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight\naltitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\\deg} to 75{\\deg}, and\nall-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination\nconditions.

In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition\nattributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world\ndeployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide\nobject-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object\ncategories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes.

Subsequent investigations into\nenhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their\nperformance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of\nMLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated\nimage-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework\ntermed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to\nlearn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on\nthe ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the\nrendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a\nclosed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual\nfeedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be\noptimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments\non image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF\nsubstantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised\nfine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely\nvisual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable\nreasoning models without requiring explicit supervision.

Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented.

A particular source of variability in\nWhole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus\ncalling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world\nadoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per\ninstitution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on\nscanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis\nand treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on\nstandard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during\ntraining, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same\ntissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset\nexplicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.\nSCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding\n2,400 spatially aligned patches.

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses\non events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded\nand use this information to recover its original intensity.

Despite its progress in remote sensing\napplications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.\nExisting datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and\nstatic-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD\nviews, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we\npresent RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD\nscenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask\ntriplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,\ncluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in\nprevious benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object\ndrift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the\nSemantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly\ninjecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic\ninformation to different stages of the network. Specifically, the\nCategory-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with\nobject categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion\nModule (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve\nreasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD\npresents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these\nchallenges.

To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation\napproach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking\nthe lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a\ntwo-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,\nwe provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside\nthe audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs\nneither masked input images nor identity reference images.
