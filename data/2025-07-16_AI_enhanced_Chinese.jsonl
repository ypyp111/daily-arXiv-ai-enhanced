Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives.

In Bayesian UQ, Hessian\napproximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nproposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the\nefficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale\nproblems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products,\nand performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave\nequations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank\nmethods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient. We\nadapt two existing high-rank Hessian approximations -- the point spread\nfunction method and the pseudo-differential operator probing method. Building\non an observed duality between these approaches, we develop a novel method that\nunifies their complementary strengths. We validate these methods on a synthetic\nquadratic model and on the Marmousi model. Numerical experiments show that\nthese high-rank Hessian approximations substantially reduce the computational\ncosts in FWI. In UQ, MCMC samples computed using no Hessian approximation or a\nlow-rank approximation explore the posterior slowly, providing little\nmeaningful statistical information after tens of thousands of iterations and\nunderestimating the variance. At the same time, the effective sample size is\noverestimated, providing false confidence. In contrast, MCMC samples generated\nusing the high-rank Hessian approximations provide meaningful statistical\ninformation about the posterior and more accurately assess the posterior\nvariance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u79e9Hessian\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u5730\u9707\u5168\u6ce2\u5f62\u53cd\u6f14\uff08FWI\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u79e9Hessian\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347FWI\u548cUQ\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u70b9\u6269\u6563\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4f2a\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9ad8\u79e9Hessian\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u79e9Hessian\u8fd1\u4f3c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86FWI\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728UQ\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u79e9Hessian\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728FWI\u548cUQ\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This study fundamentally questions whether such\nartificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments\nwith the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an\nendogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit\nspontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic\nconvergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external\ninductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that\nthe human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and\nresonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM\ndemonstrates stronger generality and efficiency.

However, popular pre-defined and adaptive schedulers can still lead\nto suboptimal generalization. This paper introduces VolSched, a novel adaptive\nLR scheduler inspired by the concept of volatility in stochastic processes like\nGeometric Brownian Motion to dynamically adjust the learning rate. By\ncalculating the ratio between long-term and short-term accuracy volatility,\nVolSched increases the LR to escape plateaus and decreases it to stabilize\ntraining, allowing the model to explore the loss landscape more effectively. We\nevaluate VolSched on the CIFAR-100 dataset against a strong baseline using a\nstandard augmentation pipeline.

Yet, a pressing\nchallenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot\nsettings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual\nclassification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a\nnon-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmodule. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three\nconfigurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)\nfine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated\norchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.\nUsing confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator\nmodulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\\% accuracy\nimprovement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,\nachieving 85.63\\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL\ndisplayed overconfidence.

Due to the tendency of vapor to undergo phase change under pressure\nvariation upon impact, the dynamics of this entrapped vapor pocket are\ndifferent from those of a non-condensable air pocket. In this work, we\nexperimentally investigate the dynamics of the entrapped vapor pocket, more\nspecifically its time evolution and its subsequent influence on the\nhydrodynamic loads at different equilibrium ambient temperatures and impact\nvelocities. We find that the retraction of the vapor pocket at high ambient\ntemperature and small impact velocity is slow, occurring from the disk edge,\nand driven by the dynamic pressure $\\rho_{\\text{L}}U_0^2$. In contrast, at\nlower ambient temperatures and large impact velocities, after a short initial\nstage, the vapor pocket will collapse rapidly due to condensation. This\nscenario is confirmed by conducting experiments where, by heating the disk, the\nvapor pocket collapse is observed to slow down. We attribute this to the\nvaporization of liquid near the three-phase contact line region that frustrates\nthe condensation process and reduces the impact pressure on the disk. The\nviolent collapse of the vapor pocket may impart additional instantaneous\nmomentum, but the overall pressure and force impulses are still found to be\nclosely associated with the liquid added mass. Finally, we found that at a high\ntilt angle of the disk, the three-phase contact line movement over the disk\nsurface may hinder the proper entrapment and compression of the vapor pocket,\nwhich results in a lower central impact pressure as rapid condensation at the\ncentral disk region does not occur.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6cb8\u817e\u6db2\u4f53\u4e2d\u5e73\u677f\u51b2\u51fb\u65f6\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6d41\u4f53\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u51b2\u51fb\u901f\u5ea6\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6cb8\u817e\u6db2\u4f53\u4e2d\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u5728\u51b2\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u6d41\u4f53\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u53d8\u5bf9\u51b2\u51fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u51b2\u51fb\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6d41\u4f53\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a0\u70ed\u5e73\u677f\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u6e29\u548c\u5c0f\u51b2\u51fb\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u7f13\u6162\u6536\u7f29\uff1b\u4f4e\u6e29\u548c\u9ad8\u901f\u51b2\u51fb\u4e0b\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u5feb\u901f\u574d\u584c\u3002\u52a0\u70ed\u5e73\u677f\u51cf\u7f13\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u503e\u659c\u89d2\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "conclusion": "\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u51b2\u51fb\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u503e\u659c\u89d2\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u84b8\u6c7d\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u538b\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u3002"}}

However, research in this area is still fragmented across\ndifferent communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered\nframeworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the\nSemantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM).

The\nclosing of the cavity generates a thrust-producing jet. Our previous\nexperimental study (Mahulkar and Arakeri, PRF, 2024) compared the flow fields\nof the clapping body in two cases: free-moving (dynamic) and\nforward-constrained (stationary). The experiments revealed significant\ndifferences in body motion and flow structures. This numerical study further\ninvestigates these differences using plate motion data from the experiments.\nOur computations show that, in dynamic cases, interplate cavity pressure is\nlower than in stationary cases. A basic unsteady Bernoulli analysis explains\nthat forward acceleration reduces interplate pressure. Furthermore, stationary\ncases exhibit distinct vortex dynamics, with starting vortex tubes forming at\nthe plate edges and reconnecting with stopping vortex tubes to form triangular\nvortex loops in the rear wake, along with two sideways-oriented ringlets. In\ndynamic cases, the starting vortex tubes slide backward and reconnect with\nbound-vorticity threads shed from the outer surface of the plates, forming\nelliptical loops that reconnect circumferentially. Referring to Sullivan et al.\n(JFM, 2008), we quantify the energy deficit in isolated axisymmetric vortex\nrings using separate simulations and propose a model for the potential energy\nin the vortex core at the formation time.

Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical\napplications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing\nimputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the\nvarying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to\nunreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood.\nTo address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph\nCompletion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known\nneighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to\niteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering\ninformation to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware\nFeature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting\npropagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently,\nHierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing\nnodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood\nattributes.

Traditional\napproaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent\nproperties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state\nparabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for\ncomputational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a\nGraph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is\nspecifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in\nneural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent\nrepresentations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration\nprofiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global\ngraph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent\nspace via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration\nof an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models\nwith reduced training data requirements.

However, LLMs' judicial\nfairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive\ninconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring\nsevere LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones.

We also analyse model parameters\nacross checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights\nthe most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer\nMLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the\nout-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of\nthe model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on\nknowledge-intensive benchmarks.

Existing methods often rely on\nfully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.\nIn this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self\ndistillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View\n(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view\nlocalization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking.

This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images.

In addition, this study proposes a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme\nupon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature\nrepresentation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports\ndatasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the\nperformances on these datasets are noteworthy.

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep\nlearning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective\nplayer and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction.\nHowever, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of\ninteractions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling\nmatch dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous\nInteraction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep\nlearning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a\nmulti-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player\ndynamics and high-level team interactions.

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes.

Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and\nlocal information have achieved promising results.

To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the\ncandidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which\nalleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality.

On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent\nquery-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to\nWorkflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow\nsimilarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention\nFramework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to\nLLM-driven Workflow Generation. We present a reproducible, customizable\nLLM-based Intention Capture system to extract Workflow Signals and Workflow\nIntentions from user queries. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the\nproposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to\ndirect generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention\nElicitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Opus Prompt Intention Framework\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff08Intention Capture\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6765\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOpus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6Workflow Signals\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u4e3aWorkflow Intention\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u57281000\u4e2a\u591a\u610f\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2-\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5bf9\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "Opus\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u610f\u56fe\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u610f\u56fe\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

However,\nachieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian\nSplatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently\nambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that\nenables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a\nregularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional\nregularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled\nLatent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality\npart-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region\nwhile preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as\nGaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond\nthe existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local\n3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects\nqualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and\nflexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoMaP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u5c40\u90e83D\u9ad8\u65af\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D-GALP\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316SDS\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7\u522b3D\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u5c40\u90e83D\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548cSDS\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "RoMaP\u7ed3\u54083D-GALP\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5229\u7528\u7403\u8c10\u7cfb\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316SDS\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5305\u62ecL1\u951a\u5b9a\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u79fb\u9664\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SLaMP\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u7f16\u8f912D\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRoMaP\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5c40\u90e83D\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "RoMaP\u4e3a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7\u522b\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While recent\nstudies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these\napproaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term\nextrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics\nknowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in\ncomplex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture\nlong-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical\nsystems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization\nability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially\nknown physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system\ndynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a\nPhy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce\na physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align\nwith system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the\nsolutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world\napplications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and\nCOVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of\nPhy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation\ntasks.

The approach, integrated into an\nonline RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceGPR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9053\u8def\u5730\u4e0b\u75c5\u5bb3\uff08RSD\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dGPR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684RSD\u8bc6\u522b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D GPR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8d85\u8fc798.6%\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea690%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RSD\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our primary\nmotivation is to rigorously examine the exploration-exploitation trade-off in\nthe context of sampling. We systematically define plausible notions of regret\nfor this framework and establish corresponding lower bounds. We then propose a\nsimple algorithm that achieves these optimal regret bounds. Our theoretical\nresults demonstrate that in contrast to optimization, sampling does not require\nexploration. To further connect our findings with those of multi-armed bandits,\nwe define a continuous family of problems and associated regret measures that\nsmoothly interpolates and unifies multi-armed sampling and multi-armed bandit\nproblems using a temperature parameter. We believe the multi-armed sampling\nframework, and our findings in this setting can have a foundational role in the\nstudy of sampling including recent neural samplers, akin to the role of\nmulti-armed bandits in reinforcement learning.

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which\nis the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly\ndefine, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL\ncomprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation\n(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent\nsamples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives\nfor effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)\nHard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware\noptimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic\nlabels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives\ncloser in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability\nand robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the\npotential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust\nCC-ReID.

This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is\noften impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the\neffectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based\naugmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image\ndiffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we\nintroduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via\nspoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally\ncongruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned\nIP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'\nreappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,\nexternalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we\nconducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive\nemotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive\nimages from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without\nAI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal\nsignificantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control\nconditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between\nparticipant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief,\nsuggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy.

Previous work has attempted to\ncompare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that\nhave different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We\nintroduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on\nup to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their\nrespective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as\ndecoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at\nclassification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.\nHowever, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice\nversa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse\nobjective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa\nfor generative tasks).

Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent\nLatent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature\ncontrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray\nimages and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental\nresults indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art\ngenerative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the\nLIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing\nthe effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but\ncan also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as\ntext-to-image synthesis.

However, the scarcity of smoke image\ndata from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the\ndetection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising\nsolution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting\nmodels exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,\nparticularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and\nbackground contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive\nframework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the\npre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks\nand image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and\nmasked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided\nby mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the\nmask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated\neffects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask\nedges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for\nsubsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a\nmultimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and\nreasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic\ndataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and\ndiverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection\nmodels.

Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual\nsimilarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it\ndifficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a\nmixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial\nexamples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes\nhyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative\narchitectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically\non reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient\ntraining data is available.

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity.

This approach\nnaturally extends to enable instance-level comparisons. We evaluate both an\nexact and a greedy variant of our metric under various parameter settings,\nusing the StrIPLIB dataset. Results show that all components of the metric\ncontribute to class identification, and that the greedy version achieves\naccuracy nearly identical to the exact formulation while being nearly 200 times\nfaster.

We evaluate the proposed metric on\ncontrolled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with\nsynthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that\nthe models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,\nproviding insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper\ninterpretability.

We show that a single Fairness Reward Model, trained on\nweakly supervised, LLM-annotated examples of biased versus unbiased reasoning,\ntransfers across tasks, domains, and model families without additional\nfine-tuning. Applied to real-world decision-making tasks including recidivism\nprediction and social media moderation, we show that our approach consistently\nimproves fairness while matching, or even surpassing, baseline accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\u516c\u5e73\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08FRM\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5e73\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08FRM\uff09\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u914d\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "FRM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how\nnon-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized\nextreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.\n(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series\ndata influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated\nseveral synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and\ntrained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL\napproaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world\ndatasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental\nresults show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when\ndealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate\ndetrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different\ndata distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53bb\u8d8b\u52bf\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u53bb\u8d8b\u52bf\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u53bb\u8d8b\u52bf\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5408\u9002\u7684\u53bb\u8d8b\u52bf\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u53bb\u8d8b\u52bf\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Among machine learning approaches,\nreinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for\ntractography, outperforming traditional methods in several key aspects.\nTractOracle-RL, a recent RL-based approach, reduces false positives by\nincorporating anatomical priors into the training process via a reward-based\nmechanism.

Instead of relying on human input, IRT leverages\nbundle filtering methods to iteratively refine the oracle's guidance throughout\ntraining.
