The underlying Gaussian structure", "comment": "44 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "We develop, simulate and extend an initial proposition by Chaves et al.\nconcerning a random incompressible vector field able to reproduce key\ningredients of three-dimensional turbulence in both space and time. In this\nfirst article, we focus on the important underlying Gaussian structure that\nwill be generalized in a second article to account for higher-order statistics.\nPresently, the statistical spatial structure of this velocity field is\nconsistent with a divergence-free fractional Gaussian vector field that encodes\nall known properties of homogeneous and isotropic fluid turbulence at a given\nfinite Reynolds number, up to second-order statistics. The temporal structure\nof the velocity field is introduced through a stochastic evolution of the\nrespective Fourier modes. In the simplest picture, Fourier modes evolve\naccording to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, where the characteristic time scale\ndepends on the wave-vector amplitude. For consistency with direct numerical\nsimulations (DNSs) of the Navier-Stokes equations, this time scale is inversely\nproportional to the wave vector amplitude. As a consequence, the characteristic\nvelocity that governs the eddies is independent of their size and is related to\nthe velocity standard deviation, which is consistent with some features of the\nso-called sweeping effect. To ensure differentiability in time while respecting\nthe causal nature of the evolution, we use the methodology developed by\nViggiano et al. to propose a fully consistent stochastic picture, predicting in\nparticular proper temporal covariance of the Fourier modes. We finally derive\nanalytically all statistical quantities in a continuous setup and develop\nprecise and efficient numerical schemes of the corresponding periodic\nframework.

The current study\npresents a novel diagnostic method to quantify the CO2 distribution at the\nair-water interface in a spatially and temporally resolved manner. This method\ncombines the advantages of tunable diode laser spectroscopy and rapid spatial\nbeam scanning for precision measurement of the CO2 concentration profile above\nthe interface. The performance of this method was examined in a series of\nquasi-1D demonstration experiments conducted in a custom-built miniature gas\nchamber, where the cross-interface diffusion and absorption of gas-phase CO2\ninto pure water and alkaline solutions of different pH values were continuously\nmonitored.

Additionally, an interesting\nphenomenon was observed regarding the temporal evolution of interfacial CO2\nconcentration at different pH levels: its depletion rate exhibited strong pH\nsensitivity at relatively low pH but saturated near pH = 10.

To\nsupport existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the\nPATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world\nscenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement\nPipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and\nrefines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we\nfurther construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances\nmanually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our\ndata, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on both sub-tasks.

Such deformation\noften originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence\nvary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods\nfor modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are\ncomputationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.\nNeural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently\nsolving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in\naccelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct\napplication across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical\nlimitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on\ndiffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural\noperator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are\nexplicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural\nnetwork constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is\nthen trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of\ndeformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the\ndiffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient\nprediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The\nproposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient\nsolution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying\ngeometries.

If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered\ntoward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,\nthen those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over\npublic discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can\nreliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such\nsteering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop\nmethods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt\na previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias\nauditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original\nframework, which does not require access to the internals of the language\nmodel. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing\ndistributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically\nrelated to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable\nfor auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a\nseries of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its\npotential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior."}

However, the performance of\ndeep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous\ndata. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data\nexhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label\ndependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.\nWhile most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label\nclassification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as\nmedical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address\nthis important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label\ndata with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a\ngeometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class\ncollapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class\nmeans form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we\npropose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn\nhigh-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure\napplicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain\nmultiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that\nextracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled\nclass-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which\nmitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data\ndistributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage\ncompact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four\nbenchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging\nFL scenario."}

Through a systematic comparison of human and model\nattention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced\ninterpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided\nattention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our\napproach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains\nof up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results\ndemonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the\nreasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs."}

Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:\n(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with\naffirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the\ninput using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that\nenhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically\nevaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results\ndemonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a\nsingle attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often\nrequire multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs."}

We propose\na discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically\nallocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance\ngains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange\nstrategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the\nacceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher\nnumbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach."}

The proposed technique involves a novel\ncombination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,\nmutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.\nThen, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by\nmutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nthat predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN\npredictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple\ndrug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible\ntreatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater\nthan 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing\nplayed an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating\nthat each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key\ndriver mutations, consistent with current research.

Moreover, this pattern severely limits\nflexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion\nmodels in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nproposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various\nconsistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative\nstrategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different\nconsistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their\ncomputed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution\ntrajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on\nthe proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the\nsolution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of\nsmoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and\nhigh-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the\napplicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation\nscenarios.

Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke\ndetectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\\%.\n  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing\ntext-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,\nMeta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related\nconcepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate\nthat this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy\nplummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,\nensuring it was unseen during pre-training.

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable\nsimpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the\nground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber\nand total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,\nmean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean\nabsolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across\nendpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,\nwith energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC\nexceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a\nchain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed\nsolely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values\nfrom 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,\ntext-based dietary monitoring tools."}

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the\nslow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient\nmodels are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission\nof redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)\nframework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis.

At the center of this method is a network\narchitecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,\nan erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network\npredicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it\nadheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a\nblack-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the\ninteraction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the\nmulti-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface\ninteractive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our\nmulti-modal fusion strategy.

These behaviors are stored in a \"behavior handbook\"\nwhich supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into\nparameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved\ntest-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned\ninference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning\nreduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving\nbaseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter\nupdates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors\nfrom its own past problem solving attempts.

This research\nintroduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise\nprocess parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data\nrequirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from\nvacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by\nimage augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour\nalgorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process\nparameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The\nmodel exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time,\nand vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency."}

Various means to boost ML's adversarial\nrobustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair\nrobustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than\nfrom others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial\nrobustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has\nfocused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight\nis that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as\nface recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,\nleading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that\nseeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful\nas from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable\nbecause class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.\nAdditionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces\nsymmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions\nwhere group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to\nencourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively\nevaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including\nagainst targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR\nsignificantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across\nruns. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover\nin this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be\nclassified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry."}

Current FDA-cleared\nsystems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output\nmay limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective\noutput format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge\nthat is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI\nassistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and\nMessidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source\nmedical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI\nassistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration\nwhere GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at\nbaseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed\nnear-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions\nbased on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect\nones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o\nachieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even\nwithout direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs\nmay improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for\nstudying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,\nlightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource\nsettings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician\ntrust in clinical workflows."}

This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and\noperates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually\nprovide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,\nor do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate\npopular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that\nthey succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,\nsuggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization\nmethods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations\noften reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated\nthem, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken\ntogether, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental\ncontrols to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful\ninsights into the operations of LLMs."}
