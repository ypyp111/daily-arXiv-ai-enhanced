Despite this advancement,\ncurrent AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive\nnature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or\nincorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is\nmost apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain\nunderdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring\nsystems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,\nindividualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel\nmulti-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized\nfeedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to\nenable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students\nto learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise\nfor exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized\nexercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in\neducation by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical\nagents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and\neffective systems for teaching mathematics."}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features.

EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate\nour approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results\ndemonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out\nof 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared\nto its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves\nsimilar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL."}

The main\nphysical parameters are the time window over which self-similar behavior is\nsought (equal to approximately one eddy turnover time), viscosity (inversely\nproportional to the ``Reynolds number\") and an integer parameter characterizing\nthe distance in the Fourier space over which self-similar interactions occur.\nLocal solutions to this nonconvex PDE optimization problems are obtained with a\nstate-of-the-art adjoint-based gradient method. Two distinct families of\nsolutions, termed viscous and inertial, are identified and are distinguished\nprimarily by the behavior of enstrophy which, respectively, uniformly decays\nand grows in the two cases.

One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we\npropose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the\ngeneration of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the\nfeature space become available with time.

An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker.

Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC\nconstrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We\nestablish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the\nsingle-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the\noptimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the\ncomputational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation\nalgorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred\nto as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound\n(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a\ndecision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a\ncontrolling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish\ntheoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

Retinal\nphenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum\nlipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography\nElectrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).\nStrong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly\nbetween average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as\ntriacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These\nassociations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under\nmetabolic stress. By linking detailed\n  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a\ncritical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration\nnot only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but\nalso presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,\nnon-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early\ndetection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular\nhealthcare."}

An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking.

Fortunately,\nfoundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong\npotential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which\npromotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in\nlong-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual\nencoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,\noverlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we\npropose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for\nlong-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance\nderived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.\nSpecifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as\nsemantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The\nintroduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the\nmodel to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the\nalignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent\nclass-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the\nresulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class\nless than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware\ncompensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction\nbias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical\nanalysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function.

In this paper, we propose a fundamental question\ngeneration with the integration of question embeddings for video question\nanswering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability\nof the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ\ngenerates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the\ntraining data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable\nthe model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced\ngeneralizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign\nmodule that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,\nensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the\nadaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate\nthat our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing\nbaseline methods."}

An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the\nsecond stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by\nthe SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively.

To explore this gap, we\nbegin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for\nmaintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able\nto train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.\nWe find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves\nstandard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models\nto reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's\nupdate having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method\nthat improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter\ntransformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches\nvalidation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz\ntransformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the\nNanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound\nincreases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without\nstability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping."}

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency\nby 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different\nconditioning mechanisms or complex architectures.

The resulting parts can\nbe seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring\nadditional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation\ncapabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,\ndemonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part\ngeneration."}

Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still\nunderperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a\nmulti-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS\ntiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel\ndesigns: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.\nGuided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement\nmodules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)\nmodule employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny\nobjects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive\nfusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow\nand fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural\ndetail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our\nRS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and\n6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior\ndetection performance in diverse RS scenarios.

This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract\nmulti-scale, high-level features at deeper layers.
