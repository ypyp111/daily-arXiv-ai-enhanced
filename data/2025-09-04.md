Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了主动特征采集在改善主动脉穿窄诊断方面的潜力，使心趄评估更高效、可扩展性更强且更个性化

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-DG是一个神经符号框架，通过整合视觉变换器和专家指导的符号推理，在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中实现了跨域泛化，准确率提升达5.2%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中模型在真实世界分布偏移下泛化能力不足的问题，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中的域泛化挑战

Result: 在四个公共数据集上显著改进：跨域设置中准确率提升达5.2%，比基线ViT模型提升6%；符号模型在MDG中达到63.67%平均准确率；病变特征准确率达84.65%，大幅超越纯神经方法

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅增强可解释性，还作为有效正则化器

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR是一个快速、鲁棒的刚性配准框架，用于连续切片WSI图像对齐，支持多种染色类型，在几分钟内完成配准，为计算病理学提供可复现的基准工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WSI序列配准方法通常依赖复杂的可变形或深度学习模型，计算量大且难以复现，而许多连续切片场景只需要轻量级的刚性配准框架，但目前这类方法开发不足。

Method: STAR框架集成了染色条件预处理、分层粗到精相关策略、自适应核缩放和内置质量控制，实现跨异质组织类型和染色协议的可靠刚性配准。

Conclusion: STAR作为一个开源轻量级工具，降低了临床应用的障碍，为下一代计算病理学的大规模配对数据准备提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

*Victor Solomon,Piet Martens,Jingyu Liu,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet是一种基于U-Net的太阳细丝分割架构，通过引入可学习的边缘图来增强自注意力机制，显著提高了细丝边界和分支的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在H-alpha观测中难以捕捉太阳细丝的精细结构（特别是分支），主要原因是长程依赖建模能力和空间细节处理能力有限。

Method: 在U-Net骨干网络基础上，直接从输入图像生成可学习的边缘图，并将边缘信息线性变换到注意力机制的Key和Query矩阵中，引导瓶颈层的自注意力更有效地捕捉细丝边界。

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上，EdgeAttNet超越了U-Net和其他基于U-Net的transformer基线，实现了更高的分割精度和显著更好的细丝分支识别，同时推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过将结构先验显式整合到注意力计算中，EdgeAttNet在减少可训练参数的同时，增强了空间敏感性和分割准确性，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA是一个无需训练的双智能体系统，通过文本智能体和图像智能体协作增强实例分割数据集，显著提升性能指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高、类别不平衡问题，现有方法缺乏大语言模型与扩散模型的深度协作，未能充分利用现有训练数据信息

Method: 提出双智能体系统：1) 文本智能体(T-Agent)通过Prompt Rethink机制迭代优化提示词，促进LLM与扩散模型协作；2) 图像智能体(I-Agent)基于训练图像生成新实例来丰富数据分布

Result: 在LVIS 1.0验证集上，相比基线提升box AP +4.0和mask AP +3.3，优于领先模型DiverGen，在常见类别上表现尤为突出

Conclusion: InstaDA通过双智能体协作有效增强实例分割数据集，无需额外训练，具有实用性和高效性

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于原型的方法通常为支撑图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，当支撑图像和查询图像存在显著差异时效果不佳。

Method: 提出SPENet网络：1）多级原型生成模块同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型；2）查询引导的局部原型增强模块根据查询图像指导自适应优化支撑原型。

Result: 在三个公共医学数据集上的大量实验表明，SPENet优于现有的最先进方法，实现了卓越性能。

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型匹配和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化和图像差异问题，取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注小目标检测，而小目标实例分割研究不足且缺乏专用数据集。SAM模型在小目标分割中性能显著下降，主要由于1/16的粗糙特征分辨率导致细粒度空间细节丢失

Method: SOPSeg框架包含区域自适应放大策略以保留细粒度细节，采用集成边缘预测和渐进细化的定制解码器，并提出面向遥感应用中广泛采用的定向边界框的新提示机制

Result: SOPSeg在小目标分割方面优于现有方法，并支持遥感任务的高效数据集构建

Conclusion: 构建了基于SODA-A的全面小目标实例分割数据集，将发布模型和数据集以支持未来研究

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Conclusion: 后处理水印结合集成攻击网络训练能有效增强水印鲁棒性，多域多架构攻击网络组合是提升抗攻击能力的关键策略。

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

TL;DR: 该研究发现大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)存在将文本输入错误感知为图像内容的倾向，通过识别特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)来检测视觉缺失，并提出方法来修正模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉和文本输入时，经常错误地将文本中缺乏视觉证据的概念误认为是图像内容，导致错误响应。研究旨在探究模型是否具备判断文本概念是否基于图像内容的内在能力。

Method: 识别出特定的前馈网络神经元(VA神经元)，这些神经元通过独特的激活模式持续指示视觉缺失。基于这些模式开发检测模块，系统分类输入标记是否基于视觉内容，并通过重新解释问题提示或在生成过程中替换检测到的缺失标记来优化输出。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效缓解了模型错误假设文本输入具有视觉存在的倾向，并在各种大型视觉语言模型中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 通过识别和利用VA神经元的激活模式，可以开发有效的检测和修正机制来解决LVLMs错误感知文本输入为图像内容的问题，提高模型的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Method: 端到端双分支跨模态特征提取框架，提出域内语义对齐和域间语义对抗学习策略，对齐相同语义的视觉和文本特征，同时惩罚前景和背景特征之间的相似性

Result: 在两个整体和两个遮挡ReID基准测试上进行了全面实验，证明了方法的有效性和通用性，结果达到或超越了当前最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过联合建模前景和背景信息，并采用语义对齐和对抗学习策略，能够有效抑制噪声背景区域并增强对身份相关前景线索的关注，显著提升行人重识别性能

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the
small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the
MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

Motivation: 传统条件激流模型在多任务场景中难以利用任务间的内在关联，尤其是在缺乏训练数据的不良问题中。静态条件控制方式也难以适应多任务的动态特性。

Method: 提出动态条件双激流桥训练范式：1）将激流和条件生成过程解耦；2）使用同样的噪声调度生成动态条件，逐渐调整统计特征并嵌入时间相关信息。

Conclusion: 动态条件方法能够有效解决条件激流模型在不良多任务中的挑战，通过解耦激流和条件生成过程，并利用动态条件提升网络学习效果。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

Abstract: Bangla language consists of fifty distinct characters and many compound
characters. Several notable studies have been performed to recognize Bangla
characters, both handwritten and optical. Our approach uses transfer learning
to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten
characters while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. Deep Neural Network
techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural
Network (ResNet), and MobileNet are applied to generate an end-to-end
classification of all possible standard formations of handwritten characters in
the Bangla language. The Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset, which contains 166,105

Conclusion: ADA-GAN模型通过数据增强和对抗训练的方式，显著提升了复杂草书手写字符的分类性能，为解决此类挑战性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差导致的幻觉问题，现有方法缺乏对实例间偏差水平波动的理解，需要一种无需额外资源就能同时缓解两种偏差的有效方法。

Method: 使用基于梯度的自反思方法估计不同类型token（视觉、提示、先前输出）的影响，检测物体相关视觉token，并将其整合到影响感知对比解码框架中。

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖额外资源的情况下，通过token影响估计和对比解码有效缓解多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting

Motivation: 人脸识别系统可能被用户照片等欺骗攻击非法认证，现有反欺骗检测方法依赖深度学习需要大量训练数据，如果训练数据被恶意注入后门，可能导致特定欺骗攻击被误判为活体

Method: 提出后门投毒攻击方法，将欺骗攻击的人脸图像特征嵌入到活体人脸图像中，但不引起任何可察觉的视觉变化

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法对现有欺骗攻击检测系统构成实际威胁

Conclusion: 该方法展示了人脸反欺骗检测中后门投毒的潜在威胁，特定欺骗攻击能够成功绕过检测系统

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

*Jialu Li,Chen Wu,Meiqi Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIM-Net是一个时间序列变化检测网络，通过从变化时刻推断变化区域来确保结果一致性，包含差异提取增强、粗粒度变化时刻提取、细粒度变化时刻提取和变化区域推断三个关键步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，因此需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: 采用三步骤方法：1)差异提取和增强使用轻量编码器和边界增强卷积；2)粗粒度变化时刻提取进行时空相关性分析；3)细粒度变化时刻提取使用多尺度时间CAM模块加权变化时刻，并从中推断变化区域。

Result: 通过从变化时刻推断变化区域的方法，确保了变化检测结果中区域和时刻的一致性。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过利用时间序列分析和空间变化检测之间的内在关系，实现了从变化时刻到变化区域的一致性推断，为时间序列变化检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GravityDB方法，通过引力场驱动的扩散桥来解决手-物体交互中的穿透、间隙和手部变形问题，生成物理合理且语义有意义的交互状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法在处理复杂几何形状时存在穿透、接触区域间隙问题，且难以捕捉手部在交互过程中的真实变形。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，使用基于引力场的扩散桥来模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互，并整合文本语义信息指导引力场构建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效消除穿透、确保稳定抓握、捕捉真实手部变形，生成物理合理的交互状态。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法成功解决了手-物体交互中的关键挑战，为生成物理合理且语义有意义的交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TADM-3D模型，一个3D时间感知扩散模型，用于准确预测MRI脑部结构变化，通过脑龄估计器和双向时间正则化来改善时间关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要局限：(1)未能明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系；(2)仅依赖扫描插值，缺乏临床实用性；(3)大多基于2D切片架构，忽略了完整的3D解剖上下文。

Method: 使用预训练的脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成准确反映年龄差异的MRI；提出Back-In-Time正则化(BITR)，通过双向训练（从基线到随访和从随访到基线）提高时间准确性。

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC数据集的外部测试集上验证了泛化性能。

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够准确预测脑部MRI的进展，通过时间感知机制和双向正则化显著改善了纵向预测的准确性。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的损失函数（负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失）来保持生物医学分割中细长结构的连续性，在3D轴突起始段分割任务中显著减少了不连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级精度更重要，现有方法容易因信号丢失导致分割不连续。

Method: 使用负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失结合CNN，并讨论了降采样和间距校正等实验设计特征来获得连续分割掩码。

Result: 在3D光片荧光显微镜轴突起始段数据集上，相比标准CNN和现有拓扑感知损失，显著减少了每个实例的分割不连续性，特别是在信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算。

Conclusion: 损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用中分割的可靠性。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人群密度估计中依赖细粒度位置标注的问题，这些标注收集耗时且难以扩展，限制了实际应用

Method: 使用历史地图库生成伪密度图，通过超几何分布采样估计人群区域，并添加自监督对比空间正则化器来增强空间感知

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于跨域适应方法，在半监督设置下比现有最先进方法表现更好，能够有效从计数标注中提取空间信息

Conclusion: Count2Density能够仅使用计数级标注训练出包含定量空间信息的密度图，为人群密度估计提供了一种更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Conclusion: 军事领域需要大型代表性数据集来进一步评估投毒攻击风险和补丁检测机会；AutoDetect方法为投毒检测提供了简单高效的解决方案，但该领域仍需更多研究。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Result: 在低强度CT图像和投影数据集上，模型表现超过传统去噪技术和其他深度学习方法：PSNR 41.87、SSIM 0.9814、RMSE 0.00236。在NIH-AAPM-Mayo挑战数据集上达到PSNR 41.52、SSIM 0.9723、RMSE 0.0051。在COVID-19 LDCT数据集的分类任务中，去噪后图像将分类准确率提升至94%，比无RL去噪提高4%

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全和准确的低强度CT成像提供了有前景的解决方案，通过强化学习动态优化去噪策略，显著提升了图像质量和医疗诊断效果

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

Result: 在ADHD-200和ABIDE基准测试中，RTGMFF在诊断准确性、敏感性、特异性和ROC曲线下面积方面均超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过整合文本生成和多模态特征融合，有效解决了fMRI脑疾病诊断中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

### [41] [PointAD+: Learning Hierarchical Representations for Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03277)
*Qihang Zhou,Shibo He,Jiangtao Yan,Wenchao Meng,Jiming Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于CLIP的2D扩展能力，进行3D异常检测的统一框架PointAD+，通过点云-像素对应关系和空间关系学习，实现了在未见对象上的零样本3D异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP在2D领域的良好扩展能力转移到3D异常检测中，以处理高度多样化类别语义的未见对象。

Method: 先设计PointAD模型通过点-像素对应表示3D异常（隐式表示），然后在PointAD+中增加显式3D表示强调空间异常关系，使用G-aggregation涵盖几何信息。通过层次表示学习和跨层次对比对齐，结合渲染层和几何层的异常语义。

Result: 大量实验证明PointAD+在零样本3D异常检测中体现优势，能够在高度多样化类别语义的未见对象上实现对异常的全面理解。

Conclusion: PointAD+通过统一框架综合利用点-像素信息和空间关系，成功将CLIP的2D扩展能力转移到3D异常检测任务，为零样本3D异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

TL;DR: 长链式思维数据对轻量级多模态语言模型推理能力提升至关重要，先进行监督微调再结合强化学习可获得最佳效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索验证奖励强化学习在参数少于70亿的轻量级多模态语言模型中的有效性，研究长链式思维数据对提升模型推理能力的作用

Method: 使用长链式思维数据进行监督微调(SFT)，随后进行强化学习(RL)阶段

Result: 长CoT数据的SFT显著提升MLLM推理能力，后续RL阶段可带来额外性能增益

Conclusion: 长链式思维数据的监督微调阶段是开发轻量级多模态语言模型推理能力的关键前提条件

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Method: 提出混合CNN-Transformer检测器，结合局部特征提取和全局上下文推理。使用热力图导向查询机制生成空间基础锚点，轻量Transformer模块提高密集聚集中的识别能力。

Result: 在ALDH1L1和GFAP染色的易活细胞数据集上，模型持续超越Faster R-CNN、YOLOv11和DETR，达到更高的敏感性和更少的假阻性，FROC分析确认了这一结果。

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer械架在健壮的易活细胞检测方面具有强大潜力，为进阶计算病理学工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云转换为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，无需特定任务训练即可提升深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性，显著改善了砖块级分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境（如砖石隧道）中获取高分辨率RGB图像不切实际，而点云虽然对昏暗光照鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且有噪声的，限制了细粒度分割。需要一种方法来解决砖块级分割的挑战。

Method: 提出InfraDiffusion框架：1）使用虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图；2）采用去噪扩散零空间模型（DDNM）恢复深度图；3）无需特定任务训练即可增强深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性；4）使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行砖块级分割。

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验表明，该方法在砖块级分割方面取得了显著改进，证明了其在砖石资产自动化检测中的潜力。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion通过将点云转换为深度图并利用扩散模型进行恢复，有效解决了低光照环境下砖石结构细粒度分割的挑战，为零样本砖块级缺陷检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时表征全局依赖和局部一致性，导致难以保持长程交互和边界细节。

Method: 使用Transformer捕获全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播阶数动态学习图结构，采用图残差机制保持全局信息和稳定训练。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架成功解决了高光谱解混中全局和局部特征同时保持的挑战，具有鲁棒性和优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在图像分类中表现优异但计算成本高昂，需要在不损失精度的情况下降低大型ViT的推理成本

Method: 使用轻量级视觉模型在推理时估计token重要性，选择性丢弃低重要性token，无需修改架构且兼容各种ViT

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，FLOPs减少高达80%，精度退化极小

Conclusion: 该框架具有出色的泛化能力和实用价值，可用于高效的ViT分类

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法对概念定制的评估要么过于狭隘要么过于泛化，与人类偏好存在偏差，特别是在多概念评估中难以准确评估概念间的交互

Method: 提出分解式GPT评分(D-GPTScore)，将评估标准分解为更细粒度的方面，并使用多模态大语言模型进行方面级评估；同时发布包含单概念和多概念任务的人类偏好对齐概念定制基准(CC-AlignBench)

Result: 该方法在基准测试中显著优于现有方法，与人类偏好表现出更高的相关性

Conclusion: 这项工作为概念定制评估建立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Motivation: 医疗应用本质上是多模态的，但临床环境中可用的模态在不同地点和患者之间存在差异。乳腺癌分子分型作为重要的临床任务，通过多模态整合可以实现个性化治疗和改善患者预后。

Method: 提出了可扩展的松散耦合多模态框架，采用基于图像和基于图的双重WSI表示方法，以及新的多模态融合策略，能够灵活整合CNV、临床记录和组织病理学图像等多种模态数据。

Result: 综合结果表明，整合双重WSI表示与CNV和临床健康记录，结合提出的流水线和融合策略，在乳腺癌分型任务上优于最先进的方法，取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅专注于乳腺癌，还设计为可轻松容纳其他模态，具有灵活扩展性，无需重新训练现有模态，适用于其他类型的癌症分析。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

TL;DR: 通过时间缩放状态空间模型(SSM)并使用转移状态技术，解决了密集视频描述中长视频处理的计算复杂性和内存限制问题，支持在线流式处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集视频描述方法在处理长视频时遇到计算复杂性和内存限制问题，且需要整个视频作为输入才能输出结果，无法支持在线处理。

Method: 提出带有转移状态的状态空间模型(SSM)，结合SSM的长序列和递归特性，解决SSM在很长上下文中无法维持状态的主要限制，实现了更长时间线的扩展。

Result: 该方法在密集视频描述中能够良好地适应不同视频长度，并使用了比7倍的FLOPs（浮点运算次数）。

Conclusion: 该模型特别适合在线或流式方式进行实时描述生成，无需等待整个视频处理完成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Motivation: 解决从低信噪比EEG信号中解码视觉神经表征的挑战，通过引入文本模态来增强EEG信号与视觉内容之间的语义对应关系。

Method: 提出了一个多模态框架，包括：1)使用文本提供显式语义标签来对齐图像和EEG特征；2)设计适配器模块来利用预训练的视觉和文本表征；3)模态一致性动态平衡(MCDB)策略来调整各模态的贡献权重；4)随机扰动正则化(SPR)来提升模型的泛化能力。

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上，方法在Top-1和Top-5准确率指标上都超越了之前的最先进方法，分别提升了2.0%和4.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态整合和创新的正则化技术，有效地从低信噪比EEG信号中解码了视觉神经表征，为神经工程和计算神经科学领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Method: 提出JTGD方法，联合训练图像生成器和检测器，使用双判别器确保合成缺陷补丁和整体图像逼真，采用CLIP-FID损失提升图像质量

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中超越现有最佳方法，参数量仅为基线方法的20%以下，更适合边缘设备部署

Conclusion: JTGD通过联合训练生成器和检测器，在资源受限环境下实现了高效的道路缺陷检测，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Result: 在KADID-10k、KonIQ-10k和AGIQA-3k数据集上对各种失真类型（合成、真实、AI生成）进行评估，在KADID-10k上达到0.93 SRCC，性能与全微调方法和专用NR-IQA模型相当

Conclusion: 这是首个利用像素空间视觉提示进行无参考图像质量评估的工作，证明了高效适应多模态大语言模型处理低级视觉任务的可行性

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在细粒度时空推理方面存在不足，特别是在处理基于时间的事件参考和手势提示的空间锚定时表现不佳，需要提升AI伴侣在动态现实环境中的空间时间感知能力。

Method: 使用数据引擎伪注释时间密集的细粒度视频元数据，以结构化方式捕获丰富的空间和时间信息，包括主体、对象、位置掩码、动作描述和时间线，生成多样化的指令调优数据。

Result: 实验评估显示，使用Strefer生成数据训练的模型在需要空间和时间消歧的任务上优于基线模型，并展现出增强的空间时间感知推理能力。

Conclusion: Strefer为感知基础的指令调优视频大语言模型建立了新的基础，无需使用专有模型、昂贵的人工标注或大量新视频标注，就能有效提升模型的时空推理能力。

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了一个全面的手写遗传效应研究数据库，包含210个家庭的手写样本，用于研究手写是否存在遗传特征和家庭关系对手写的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立一个可用于研究手写遗传效应的缺乏数据库，因为目前还没有类似的数据库可用于回答手写是否存在遗传特征、是否可以遗传以及家庭关系如何影响手写风格等问题。

Method: 通过特殊设计的表格收集210个家庭（包括祖父母、父母、叔伯、姑姐、兄弟姐妹、堂兄弟姐妹、姑侄等）的手写样本，包括数字、字母、形状和自由段落，并记录所有写作者的家庭关系。通过比较和研究家庭成员手写特征来检测他们之间的相似性和写作风格。

Result: 建立了一个全面的手写遗传效应研究数据库，证实了家庭成员手写特征和写作风格之间存在相似性，该数据库已经自由向模式识别社区开放。

Conclusion: 这个数据库为研究遗传和家庭关系对手写的影响开启了新的研究方向，并将促进该领域的进一步调查和研究。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

TL;DR: T2I-CoReBench是一个全面的文本到图像生成基准测试，通过12维评估分类法评估模型的组合和推理能力，包含1080个复杂提示和约13500个检查问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估文本到图像生成模型的组合和推理能力方面存在局限性，无法全面评估复杂场景和高密度组合，也无法处理多步推理。

Method: 构建基于场景图元素（实例、属性、关系）的组合评估和基于哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳、溯因）的推理评估，形成12维分类法，每个提示配有检查清单进行细粒度评估。

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验显示，在复杂高密度场景中组合能力仍然有限，推理能力更是关键瓶颈，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素。

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的基准测试，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力方面的局限性，特别是推理能力需要显著改进。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文本生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，提高生成速度同时保持模型性能。

Method: 1. 动态专家调度机制：根据文本复杂度智能分配计算资源；2. 分层稀疏注意力机制：将计算复杂度从O(n²)降低到O(n)；3. 软吸收引导优化策略：结合DPM-solver++减少扩散步骤。

Result: 在多个长文本生成基准测试中，DrDiff展现出优于现有最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: DrDiff框架通过三项创新技术有效解决了长文本生成的效率-质量权衡问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了生成速度。

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that
overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies.
First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently
allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text
complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of
varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of
input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while
maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance
optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion
steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on
various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文对语音识别任务进行了参数高效精细调整(PEFT)方法的综合性基准测试，包括最新的LoRA变体和自己提出的SSVD方法，并在多种模型规模下验证了域逆移适配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然低秩适配(LoRA)在语音应用中广泛使用，但其最新变体(如VeRA、DoRA、PiSSA、SVFT)主要为语言和视觉任务而开发，在语音领域缺乏充分验证。需要系统性评估这些PEFT方法在语音领域的性能。

Method: 研究在ESPnet中集成了多种PEFT方法并进行基准测试，包括结构化SVD导向(SSVD)精细调整方法。SSVD通过选择性旋转输入相关的右奇异向量而保持输出相关向量固定，以保留语义映射。

Result: 在域逆移语音识别任务(包括儿童语音和方言变体)上进行了评估，测试模型规模从0.1B到2B。SSVD方法实现了最少的可训练参数和提升的效率，能够进行稳健的域适配。

Conclusion: 这是首次在语音领域对最新PEFT方法进行综合性基准测试的研究，并为ESPnet开源平台提供了所有实现，支持可复现性和未来研究。SSVD方法在保持语义映射的同时实现了高效的域适配。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for
adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely
used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA,
PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with
limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive
integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further
introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates
input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors
fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain
adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We
evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including
child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All
implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future
work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在生成文本时如何构建关于不同种族女性的叙事，以及这些叙事是否延续了历史上的不平等结构。

Method: 从2100个生成文本中应用计算方法进行语义聚类，选择代表性样本进行质性话语分析，结合机器学习技术和人工分析。

Result: 识别出三种主要话语表征：社会超越、祖先神话化和主观自我实现，发现语法连贯的文本实际上体现了殖民结构化的女性身体框架。

Conclusion: 研究提出了结合机器学习与质性分析的综合方法，揭示了AI生成文本中隐含的殖民主义叙事结构，强调了需要批判性审视语言模型的输出内容。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在解释性注释任务中的表现面临挑战，缺乏可扩展的相似性量度来验证LLM注释与人类专家的一致性

Method: 提出IDEAlgin方法，使用"挑选异类"三元组判断任务收集人类专家的相似性评分，并比较了向量基础指标和LLM作为判断者的表现

Result: 向量基础指标无法抓取专家所重视的细腻相似性维度，而通过IDEAlgin提示的LLM在与人类判断的一致性上提升9-30%，显著改善

Conclusion: IDEAlgin为大规模评估LLM在开放式专家注释任务中的表现提供了有效范式，对教育领域及其他应用的负责任部署具有重要意义

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended,
interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or
generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text
annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives
(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether
LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is
challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of
similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable
evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied
task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing
expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task,
and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones
(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human
benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets
(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based
metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful
to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with
expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and
vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm
for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing
responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语大视觉语言模型在长上下文问答任务中的挑战，通过自动化迭代精炼提升模型性能，避免人工干预的高成本。

Method: 构建了一个包含问题生成器、评估器和答案生成器群的对抗性工作流。从原始多页面阿拉伯语文档出发，通过闭环迭代过程进行持续学习，低信心度输出触发自动重生成和模型更新。

Result: 发布了AraLongBench大规模阿拉伯语长上下文测试集，证明自治治理工作流显著超过了静态流水线的性能，大幅提升了领先阿拉伯语LVLM的长上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种高效的自动化方法，能够在无人干预情况下持续改善阿拉伯语长上下文问答生成的质量，为多页面文档理解提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

TL;DR: 本研究首次全面评估基于Transformer的架构在检测在线话语中少数群体压力方面的表现，发现图结构增强的Transformer模型在检测少数群体压力方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性少数群体和性别少数群体相比异性恋和顺性别群体经历了不成比例的高不良健康结果和心理健康障碍，这主要是由于少数群体压力造成的。需要开发有效的方法来检测在线话语中的少数群体压力，以支持数字健康干预和公共健康政策。

Method: 使用ELECTRA、BERT、RoBERTa和BART等Transformer模型与传统机器学习基线以及图增强变体进行基准测试，评估零样本和少样本学习范式，在两个最大的公开Reddit语料库上进行实验（12,645和5,789个帖子），重复五次随机种子以确保鲁棒性。

Result: 整合图结构一致提高了仅使用Transformer模型的检测性能，带有关系上下文的监督微调优于零样本和少样本方法。图增强通过建模社交连接和对话上下文，提高了模型识别关键语言标记（如身份隐藏、内化污名和寻求支持）的能力。

Conclusion: 图增强的Transformer为数字健康干预和公共健康政策提供了最可靠的基础，能够更准确地检测在线话语中的少数群体压力。

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience
disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders
compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a
consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study
presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures
for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple
transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against
traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further
assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability
on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest
publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising
12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure
robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure
consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and
that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and
few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social
connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the
models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity
concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that
graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital
health interventions and public health policy.

TL;DR: 通过LoRA微调多模态大语言模型，实现了同时进行自动发音评估和错误发音检测诊断，无需复杂结构改动或分离训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要复杂的结构调整和分离的训练流程来处理发音评估和错误检测这两个任务，本研究旨在提出一种更简单的集成方案。

Method: 使用Microsoft Phi-4-multimodal-instruct模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)方法进行微调，在Speechocean762数据集上训练，只需微调LoRA层即可实现两个任务的同时执行。

Result: 模型在发音评估得分预测上与人工评分得到强相关系数(PCC > 0.7)，同时实现低词误率(WER < 0.15)和音素误率(PER < 0.15)，效果可与全部层微调相比。

Conclusion: 这种基于LoRA的高效方法为英语L2学习者提供了更可访问、集成化和有效的计算机辅助发音训练技术，无需完整微调即可建立集成发音评估系统。

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation
Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD)
simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our
fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or
separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks.
Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores
predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC
> 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER)
and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA
layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those
achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an
integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large
multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler
training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for
simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for
more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation
Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

Conclusion: 该方法能够提供透明的审核决策见解，揭示了不同社区对表面相似规范的实际执行差异，包括社区特定语言容忍度、主题限制特征和有害话语分类的深层次类

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification
criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse,
implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and
extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an
interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of
lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic
comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these
extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural
moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making
processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how
seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously
undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for
language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of
the toxic speech classification.

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from
everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support
application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in
assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on
assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs
that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and
their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we
adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates
and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by
integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types.
Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of
assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our
benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification
process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models,
including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great
room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation
dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity
assistants.

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from
mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of
therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional
psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental
health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets
presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided
conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue
corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated
dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates
cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across
diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth
counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark
it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results
demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate
psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more
professional counseling agents.

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

Method: 在对比学习前增加新的训练阶段，采用双向生成重建任务：EBQ2D（基于嵌入的查询到文档重建）和EBD2Q（基于嵌入的文档到查询重建），交替锚定[EOS]嵌入并重建查询-文档对的两端

Result: 在Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)上显著提升LLM性能，在不同LLM基础模型和规模上都取得了新的最先进结果

Conclusion: 通过增加专门的双向生成重建训练阶段，可以有效增强[EOS]标记的语义表示能力，从而提升LLM在文本嵌入任务中的表现

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and
limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It
proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable
mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural
sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of
adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This
allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to
match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen,
the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction
of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly
improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the
paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically
evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data
perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and
robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language
understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks.
It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness
to noise and perturbation.

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular
topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis
techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis
techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine
learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages
like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is
used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing
gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network
(RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this
experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the
data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared
with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results.
It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional
RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has
achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business
company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their
customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike.
Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can
evaluate its marketing strategy.

Motivation: 语言构念如复杂性、情感性具有连续语义结构，但LLM对数值输出的特殊处理方式需要系统评估其在社会科学标量构念测量中的最佳应用方法

Method: 使用政治科学文献的多个数据集，评估四种方法：未加权直接点式评分、成对比较聚合、token概率加权点式评分和微调

Result: 直接点式评分产生不连续分布；成对比较有所改善；token概率加权方法效果更好；小模型微调（仅需1000训练对）可匹配或超越提示LLM性能

Conclusion: 为应用研究者提供了实用建议：推荐使用token概率加权点式评分或小模型微调方法来测量连续语义构念

Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or
emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech
is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes.
Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring
scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises
questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a
comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct
measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the
political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct
pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons,
token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields
actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate
pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with
bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with
pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking
pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning
smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the
performance of prompted LLMs.

Motivation: 传统指令循环注入指纹方法存在模型性能下降、计算资源消耗大、指纹持续性差等问题，需要轻量级替代方案

Method: 首次将知识编辑应用于指纹注入，使用类似乱码的文本作为指纹，提出Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT)方法来约束指纹子空间的更新

Result: FSFT方法在最坏情况下也能超过普通细调10%，但发现注入指纹的模型对指纹和相似文本的区分能力较差

Conclusion: 知识编辑是一种有效的轻量级指纹注入方法，FSFT能显著减少指纹退化，但仍需要更加突出和细粒度的指纹注入技术

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究通过眼动追踪和命名任务，比较了判别式词典模型(DLM)与传统词汇变量在预测爱沙尼亚语词汇处理中的表现，发现DLM是有效的预测指标，但深度学习映射并不比线性映射更精确，且传统预测因子通常提供更精确的拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索计算心理词典模型（DLM）生成的词汇处理测量指标是否能有效预测词汇处理反应变量，并与传统预测因子（如词频、邻域大小等）进行比较。

Method: 采用大规模单被试实验，结合词汇命名任务和眼动追踪技术，使用广义加性模型分析五个反应变量（首次注视时长、总注视时长、注视次数、命名潜伏期和口语词时长）。

Result: DLM基于的测量指标是词汇处理的有力预测因子；深度学习映射的DLM测量并不比线性映射更精确；传统预测因子通常提供更精确的拟合（总注视时长除外）；命名任务中词汇变量对首次注视时长和总注视次数无预测性。

Conclusion: DLM基于的测量指标对总注视时长、命名潜伏期和口语词时长的预测性表明，在当前词汇命名任务中，语义信息深度参与词汇处理过程。

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale
single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with
eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation
duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration)
are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the
question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a
computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model,
DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to
classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and
inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with
linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures
are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using
deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing
than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend
to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except
for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit),
and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for
first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works
with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for
total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates
that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++

automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out
of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but
translation into Romansh is still challenging.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

Conclusion: LLM在低资源语言和文化特定语境下的适应仍有很大改进空间，需要更多针对性的评测和优化

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and
reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global
or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and
culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to
bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors
and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce
SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed
specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over
7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with
the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,
encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We
evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and
GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,
overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in
culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for
improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体系统虽然性能优越但脆弱性高，当前最先进的推理LLM在智能体系统故障归因任务上准确率低于10%，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出AgenTracer框架，通过反事实重放和程序化故障注入自动标注失败的多智能体轨迹，构建TracerTraj数据集，然后使用多粒度强化学习训练轻量级故障追踪模型AgenTracer-8B。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，AgenTracer-8B比Gemini-2.5-Pro和Claude-4-Sonnet等大型专有LLM性能提升高达18.18%，并为MetaGPT和MaAS等现有多智能体系统带来4.8-14.2%的性能提升。

Conclusion: AgenTracer-8B在LLM智能体故障归因方面设立了新标准，能够为现有多智能体系统提供可操作的反馈，赋能自我修正和自我进化的智能体AI。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple
models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially
outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their
fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific
agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the
task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning
LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy
generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first
automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via
counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated
dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a
lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning,
capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions.
On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs
like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard
in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers
actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS
with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving
agentic AI.

Motivation: 语言模型在现实应用中需要世界知识，但模型如何将数据转化为知识表示的过程尚不明确。理解这些过程有助于开发更一致、鲁棒和完整的知识表示模型。

Method: 提出LMEnt套件：1）基于Wikipedia的完全实体标注的知识丰富预训练语料库；2）比先前方法性能提升80.4%的基于实体的检索方法；3）12个最多10亿参数的预训练模型和4000个中间检查点。

Conclusion: LMEnt支持语言模型知识表示、可塑性、编辑、归因和学习动态等方面的研究，相关资源已公开发布。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require
world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data
into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly
understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs
with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.
To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing
knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a
knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based
on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that
outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained
models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with
comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.
Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing
connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,
and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the
utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding
that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We
release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge
representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Conclusion: 预训练通过对称性破缺形成token簇来提升语言理解能力，其机制在NLP分类任务微调中具有普适性，甚至可类比图像分类任务。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of
meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture
on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to
implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the
mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay
between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.
The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)
increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over
all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which
increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among
tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as
inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened
along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance
considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,
higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though
the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.
These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy
along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction
confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input
meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match
tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image
classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in
fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results
were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and
fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文构建了ComplexEval基准测试，系统性地揭示和量化了大型语言模型作为评判者时存在的辅助信息诱导偏见，发现所有评估模型都对这些偏见表现出显著敏感性，且偏见程度随任务复杂性增加而加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型能力增强，面临的任务越来越复杂多样，可靠评估变得困难。现有LLM作为评判者的研究主要关注简单场景，在复杂任务中的可靠性尚未充分研究。

Method: 构建ComplexEval挑战基准，系统调查和验证了6种先前未探索的偏见，涵盖12个基础场景和3个高级场景。

Result: 所有评估模型都对这些偏见表现出显著敏感性，偏见程度随任务复杂性增加而加剧；大型推理模型表现出矛盾的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 深入分析为提高评估信号的准确性和可验证性提供了关键见解，为开发更通用和鲁棒的评估模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly
diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm
of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily
focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where
multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are
critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a
challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary
Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6
previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key
findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to
these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably,
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth
analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability
of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation
models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了第一个连续沙特手语语料集KAU-CSSL和一种基于Transformer的模型，专门用于阿拉伯手语识别，在依赖模式下达到99.02%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沙特手语(SSL)作为沙特含含过84,000人的主要沟通方式，但现有技术主要集中在非阿拉伯手语上，导致阿拉伯手语资源缺乏，特别是连续语句级别的识别需求。

Method: 研究介绍了KAU-CSSL连续沙特手语语料集，并提出了一种基于Transformer的模型，利用预训练的ResNet-18进行空间特征提取，结合双向LSTM的Transformer编码器处理时序依赖关系。

Result: 模型在依赖模式下达到了99.02%的高准确率，在独立模式下也获得77.71%的准确率，显示了该方法在沙特手语识别上的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项研究为沙特手语社区提供了重要的资源和技术支持，不仅改善了SSL社区的沟通工具，也对手语识别领域做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

Motivation: 研究奥迪A4轿车的气动性能优化，通过机器学习方法提高预测效率并寻找最佳行驶高度和倾斜角度配置

Method: 使用SolidWorks建立3D模型，CFD分析验证，采用梯度提升、随机森林和LightGBM等机器学习模型预测气动系数，差分进化算法进行多目标优化

Result: 梯度提升模型预测精度最高（R²=0.97），平衡优化使Cd降低8.3%至0.287，Cl降至-0.0826；最小阻力条件下Cd=0.285，最大下压力条件下Cl=-0.1084

Conclusion: 机器学习可有效预测汽车气动性能，优化算法能找到稳健的近似最优解，行驶高度1.341-1.365m和倾斜角度0.158-4.610度范围内气动性能优异

Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic performance of an Audi A4 sedan using
CFD analysis. A 3D model was developed in SolidWorks and validated against
DrivAer Notchback wind-tunnel data, showing only a 3.25 percent deviation in
drag coefficient (Cd). Ride height varied from 1.336 to 1.536 m and rake angle
from 0 to 5 degrees, across four Reynolds numbers. Gradient Boosting emerged as
the most accurate predictive model (R square = 0.97 for Cd and 0.96 for lift
coefficient, Cl), outperforming Random Forest and LightGBM. Differential
Evolution optimization was performed under balanced, drag-focused, and
downforce-focused conditions. Reynolds number had minimal impact on optimum
location; therefore, detailed results are reported for one Reynolds number,
with other Re showing similar trends. The baseline geometry exhibited Cd =
0.313 and Cl = 0.0288. Balanced optimization achieved Cd = 0.287 and Cl = -
0.0826. Minimum drag condition reached Cd = 0.285 with slight positive lift (Cl
= 0.0142), while maximum downforce optimization reached Cl = - 0.1084 with a
6.71 percent drag penalty (Cd = 0.334). Near-optimal solutions were found
within ride heights of 1.341 to 1.365 m and rakes of 0.158 to 4.610 degrees,
indicating robust aerodynamic performance. Machine learning predictions were
further validated against CFD with a small error in Cd.

*Christian Bauer,Claus Wagner*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 本文研究了管道湍流中流向行波壁面吹吸控制方法，发现在高达Re_τ=720的摩擦雷诺数下仍能触发再层流化，显著降低摩擦阻力和能耗。通过参数研究发现，特定参数范围的下游行波能实现显著的净节能效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管道流体输送中90%以上的能量被壁面湍流耗散，需要开发有效的流动控制方法来降低能耗。之前的研究在低雷诺数下实现了再层流化，但需要验证在高雷诺数下的有效性并找到最优控制参数。

Method: 采用直接数值模拟方法，对上游行波(UTWs)和下游行波(DTWs)进行参数研究，改变波幅a、波速c和波长λ，在Re_τ=180和360条件下分析最大减阻和净节能率的标度规律。

Result: 发现UTWs会 destabilize 流动但产生亚层流阻力，只有大振幅低速UTWs能显著降低能耗。DTWs在广泛参数范围内都能减阻，但只有特定参数组(a≈0.067-0.1U_c,lam, c≈U_c,lam, λ≈360δ_ν)能实现显著净节能，且与雷诺数无关。

Conclusion: 流向行波壁面吹吸控制能在高雷诺数下实现管道湍流的再层流化，下游行波在特定参数范围内能提供显著的净节能效果，为实际工程应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: In technical applications, more than 90\% of the energy required to pump the
fluids through pipes is dissipated by turbulence near the wall. In this
respect, streamwise traveling waves of wall blowing and suction have been used
to relaminarize turbulent pipe flow at a low friction Reynolds number of
$\mathrm{Re}_\tau=110$, considerably reducing friction losses and energy
consumption. Here, we demonstrate that streamwise traveling waves of wall
blowing and suction applied to initially turbulent pipe flow can trigger
relaminarization up to friction Reynolds numbers of $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=720$.
Furthermore, we perform a parametric study comprising both upstream traveling
waves (UTWs, $c<0$) and downstream traveling waves (DTWs, $c>0$) by varying the
traveling wave amplitude $a$, celerity $c$, and wavelength $\lambda$ at
$\mathrm{Re}_\tau=180$ and $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=360$ in order to investigate the
scaling of the maximum drag reduction and of the net energy saving rate in
direct numerical simulations. Consistent with channel flow studies in the
literature, we found that UTWs destabilize the flow, while generating
sublaminar drag due to the pumping effect. However, only low-speed UTWs with
large amplitudes were discovered to decisively reduce energy consumption. For
DTWs, a large range of wave parameters lead to a conspicuous drag reduction.
Nevertheless, only a subgroup of these wave parameters are associated with
siginificant net energy savings, i.e. $0.067U_{c,lam} \lesssim a
\lesssim0.1U_{c,lam}$, $c \approx U_{c,lam}$, and $\lambda\approx
360\delta_\nu$, independent of the Reynolds number. Here,
$U_{c,lam}=1/2\mathrm{Re}_\tau u_\tau$ is the centerline velocity of the
corresponding laminar flow, and $\delta_\nu = \nu/u_\tau$ is the viscous length
scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弹性激流是聚合物溶液中一种独特的混沌流动状态，虽然实验实现已经很多，但其基本机制仍不明确。论文的动机是通过计算模拟来探索这种激流过渡的深层机理。

Method: 采用计算模拟方法，分析了二维和三维空间维度下的压力驱动港道流。研究以两个核心建模块为中心：准确相平衡状态（narwhals）和时空间间断状态（blessings）。

Result: 研究揭示了弹性激流过渡的机制，显示这种过渡是通过narwhals（准确相平衡状态）和blessings（由多个局部narwhal解构成的时空间间断状态）的作用而形成的。

Conclusion: 这份研究为理解聚合物溶液中弹性激流的过渡机制提供了重要视角，通过计算模拟确立了准确相平衡状态和时空间间断状态在这一过程中的关键作用，填补了对这种非牛顿流体激流现象基础机制认知的空白。

Abstract: Solutions of long, flexible polymer molecules are complex fluids that
simultaneously exhibit fluid-like and solid-like behaviour. When subjected to
external flows, dilute polymer solutions develop elastic turbulence - a unique
chaotic flow state absent in Newtonian fluids such as water. Unlike turbulence
in Newtonian fluids, elastic turbulence arises from polymer stretching and
alignment in the flow, and can occur even at vanishing inertia. While
experimental realisations of elastic turbulence are well documented, its
underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
  In this paper, we present a perspective on the transition to elastic
turbulence in pressure-driven channel flows, drawing on recent computational
work from our group. We outline our current understanding of the transition in
both two and three spatial dimensions, centred on two key building blocks: (i)
narwhals, exact coherent states of the flow, and (ii) blessings,
spatio-temporal intermittent states made up of several localised narwhal
solutions.
  This contribution is based on a talk given by one of us (A.M.) at the 2024
APS DFD meeting.

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

Motivation: 当前高层次世界模型在理解和推理具有语义和时间抽象的动作方面仍然不够发达，需要能够进行有效规划的强世界模型。

Method: VLWM首先推断整体目标达成情况，然后预测由交替动作和世界状态变化组成的轨迹。使用LLM自优化方法从压缩的未来观察中提取目标，学习动作策略和动态模型，通过成本最小化进行系统-2规划。

Result: 在Visual Planning for Assistance基准测试和PlannerArena人工评估中达到最先进性能，系统-2相比系统-1提升Elo分数27%。在RoboVQA和WorldPrediction基准上也优于强VLM基线。

Conclusion: VLWM展示了语言基础世界模型在视觉规划任务中的有效性，通过结合系统-1和系统-2规划实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Motivation: 解决当前AI驱动数据分析中的两大挑战：语义运算符虽然优化但执行成本高且不适合交互式分析；Deep Research系统虽灵活但缺乏查询计划优化导致性能差。

Method: 构建原型系统，让Deep Research机器人能够编写和执行优化的语义运算符程序，结合了两种方法的优势。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI驱动数据分析领域提供了一种有前景的方向，通过结合优化执行和灵活性的方法，能够在保持高性能的同时支持更动态的数据分析任务。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

Conclusion: 研究确认了可有效转移的技术，分析了某些方法失败的原因，并讨论了自主驾驶场景下的特定适配需求

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的迭代验证框架，通过Judge LLM批评和Planner LLM修订，有效清理和优化具身AI任务计划中的噪声动作序列


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的任务计划和人类演示可能包含不必要的动作、冗余导航和逻辑错误，降低了策略质量

Method: 使用自然语言提示的迭代验证框架，Judge LLM批评动作序列，Planner LLM应用修订，逐步生成更清洁和空间连贯的轨迹

Result: 在TEACh数据集上达到90%召回率和100%精确度，96.5%的序列最多需要3次迭代收敛，同时改善时间效率和空间动作组织

Conclusion: 该方法将计划验证确立为LLM在空间规划和动作优化中的可靠能力，为具身AI模仿学习提供了可扩展的高质量训练数据路径

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

*Václav Sobotka,Lucas Kletzander,Nysret Musliu,Hana Rudová*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过系统分析三种关键转换原则（解决方案接受、低级假施重复、扰动强度）来优化跨域选择超假施中低级假施集的组成和策略转换，使平凡的随机选择机制能够超越现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的选择超假施主要关注于从预定义集中适应性选择低级假施，而本文重点研究如何构造和转换这个集合的策略，以提升跨域超假施的性能。

Method: 系统分析了基于三种关键原则的转换：解决方案接受、低级假施重复次数、扰动强度（假施影响解的比例），并在纯随机选择机制上验证转换效果。

Result: 适当构造的转换使纯随机选择机制在三个实际领域超越所有现有最先进方法，发现11个新的最佳解，且与CHeSC竞赛冠军相当。为其他超假施配置转换后在标准测试集和实际领域都超越了当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过策略性转换低级假施集的构成，可以显著提升跨域选择超假施的性能，甚至能让简单的选择机制达到领先水平，同时简化了算法设计。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

Motivation: 现有组合学习方法虽然可解释性强且能证明正确性，但无法扩展到大规模问题，只能处理数百个状态和特征的小规模实例

Method: 基于采样计划泛化的符号学习方法，使用碰集算法而非SAT/ASP，确保结构终止性和无环性

Result: 能够有效处理数百万状态和数十万特征的大规模问题，在多个基准测试中展现出良好的可扩展性

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统符号方法的规模限制，为大规模规划问题的策略学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种原则性的方法来解决探索-利用切换问题，并具有很好的通用性和性能表现

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注演绎推理，而归纳和溯因推理在解决现实问题中同样重要但研究较少，需要系统评估LLMs在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建可编程合成数据集InAbHyD，包含不完整世界模型和观察数据，要求智能体生成解释观察的假设，并基于奥卡姆剃刀原理提出新评估指标。

Result: LLMs在简单场景中能进行归纳和溯因推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现困难，即使使用上下文学习和RLVR等推理增强技术也难以产生高质量假设。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂归纳和溯因推理方面仍有局限，需要进一步研究提升其在这类推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

Result: 相比典型架构83%的信息泄露率，新框架实现了零信息泄露

Conclusion: 专业智能体在各自信息生态位中高效工作的概念可以同时提升安全性和效率

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Motivation: 随着视觉-语言-动作模型在具身AI机器人中的集成，系统面临新的安全风险：受损的VLA模型可将对抗性扰动直接转化为不安全的物理动作。传统机器学习安全方法已不足够，需要重新定义和衡量具身AI系统的安全性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了具身AI系统中先前未被充分探索但后果严重的攻击面，强调了物理AI时代对安全驱动防御的迫切需求。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决传统坐标预测方法缺乏物理可解释性和计算效率低的问题，通过参数化输出实现物理上合理的轨迹预测。

Method: 微调LLM输出轨迹模型的核心物理参数（横向位移、机动持续时间、初始横向速度、纵向速度变化），而非原始坐标。车道保持时预测离散坐标，车道变换时生成增强正弦加速度模型(SAM)参数。

Result: 实现了98.73%的整体意图预测准确率，输出大小相比基于坐标的方法减少80%，性能与传统LLM预测器相当，但在可解释性和资源效率方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM提供了一种连续、完整且物理上合理的轨迹模型，在保持高性能的同时实现了更好的可解释性和计算效率，为自动驾驶轨迹预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

Abstract: We present a high-order spacetime numerical method for discretizing and
solving linear initial-boundary value problems using wavelet-based techniques
with user-prescribed error estimates. The spacetime wavelet discretization
yields a system of algebraic equations resulting in a Sylvester matrix
equation. We solve this system with a Global Generalized Minimal Residual
(GMRES) method in conjunction with a wavelet-based recursive algorithm to
improve convergence. We perform rigorous verification studies using linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) with both convective and diffusive terms.
The results of these simulations show the high-order convergence rates for the
solution and derivative approximations predicted by wavelet theory. We
demonstrate the utility of solving the Sylvester equation through comparisons
to the commonly-used Kronecker product formulation. We show that our recursive
wavelet-based algorithm that generates initial guesses for the iterative Global
GMRES method improves the performance of the solver.

Motivation: 处理高吞吐量数据流时，每次重新计算SVD近似过于稍贵，而现有的增量更新策略在大截断秩时缩放性不佳

Method: 开发了两种算法：1)基于紧凑Householder变换的算法，将稀疏部分与低秩更新解耦，内存需求减半；2)基于Givens旋转的算法，每次旋转仅需10次浮点运算，复杂度从立方降为平方

Result: 算法精度与SVD方法相似，在推荐系统和网络大子空间追踪中表现优异，比LAPACK和增量SVD更高效

Conclusion: 新算法能够高效处理高吞吐量数据流的低秩更新，在保持精度的同时显著提高性能和降低内存需求

Abstract: For a datastream, the change over a short interval is often of low rank. For
high throughput information arranged in matrix format, recomputing an optimal
SVD approximation after each step is typically prohibitive. Instead,
incremental and truncated updating strategies are used, which may not scale for
large truncation ranks. Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms
that update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the
SVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm
that decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the
memory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm
based on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales
quadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling. The
algorithm is therefore effective for processing high-throughput updates, as we
demonstrate in tracking large subspaces of recommendation systems and networks,
and when compared to well known software such as LAPACK or the incremental SVD.

Abstract: We consider the iterative solution of generalized saddle point systems. When
the right bottom block is zero, Arioli [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 34 (2013),
pp. 571--592] proposed a CRAIG algorithm based on generalized Golub-Kahan
Bidiagonalization (GKB) for the augmented systems with the leading block being
symmetric and positive definite (SPD), and then Dumitrasc et al. [SIAM J.
Matrix Anal. Appl., 46 (2025), pp. 370--392] extended the GKB for the case
where the symmetry condition of the leading block no longer holds and then
proposed nonsymmetric version of the CRAIG (nsCRAIG) algorithm. The CRAIG and
nsCRAIG algorithms are theoretically equivalent to the Schur complement
reduction (SCR) methods where the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method and the Full
Orthogonalization Method (FOM) are applied to the associated Schur-complement
equation, respectively. We extend the GKB and its nonsymmetric counterpart used
separately in CRAIG and nsCRAIG algorithms for the case where the right bottom
block of saddle point system is nonzero. On this basis, we propose CRAIG and
nsCRAIG algorithms for the solution of the generalized saddle point problems
with the leading block being SPD and nonsymmetric positive definite (NSPD),
respectively. They are also theoretically equivalent to the SCR methods with
inner CG and FOM iterations for the associated Schur-complement equation,
respectively. Moreover, we give algorithm steps of the two new solvers and
propose appropriate stopping criteria based on an estimate of the energy norm
for the error and the residual norm. Numerical comparison with MINRES or GMRES
highlights the advantages of our proposed strategies regarding its high
computational efficiency and/or low memory requirements and the associated
implications.

Abstract: We present and analyze an integral equation method for the scattering of a
non-periodic source from a geometry consisting of two semi-infinite, periodic
structures glued together in two dimensions. The two structures may involve a
periodic wall, several layers of transmission surfaces with a shared period, or
periodic sets of obstacles. This integral equation is posed on the infinite
interface between the two periodic structures using kernels built out of the
Green's function for each structure. To combat the slow decay of the Green's
function, we also show that our integral equation can be analytically continued
into the complex plane, where it can be truncated with exponential accuracy. A
careful analysis of the domain Green's functions far from the periodic
structure is then used to prove that the analytically continued equation is
Fredholm index zero. Finally, we show that the solution we generate satisfies a
radiation condition and demonstrate an efficient and high order solver for this
problem.

Abstract: The machine learning random Fourier feature method for data in high dimension
is computationally and theoretically attractive since the optimization is based
on a convex standard least squares problem and independent sampling of Fourier
frequencies. The challenge is to sample the Fourier frequencies well. This work
proves convergence of a data adaptive method based on resampling the
frequencies asymptotically optimally, as the number of nodes and amount of data
tend to infinity. Numerical results based on resampling and adaptive random
walk steps together with approximations of the least squares problem by
conjugate gradient iterations confirm the analysis for regression and
classification problems.

### [110] [Efficient QR-based Column Subset Selection through Randomized Sparse Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03198)
*Israa Fakih,Laura Grigori*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出SE-QRSC算法，结合列主元QR分解和稀疏子空间嵌入，用于高效列子集选择，特别适用于宽矩阵（列数远大于行数）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强秩揭示QR分解对列数的依赖性强，需要开发更高效的列选择算法来降低计算复杂度，特别是在处理宽矩阵时。

Method: 通过稀疏子空间嵌入对矩阵进行压缩，在压缩后的矩阵上进行列主元QR分解选择列，然后映射回原矩阵获得最终列子集。

Result: 算法产生的分解具有强秩揭示性质，能够揭示矩阵谱信息，且对列数的依赖比传统方法显著降低。对于正交矩阵等特殊矩阵，结果完全独立于列维度。

Conclusion: SE-QRSC算法提供了一种高效的列子集选择方法，通过结合稀疏嵌入和QR分解，在保持强秩揭示性质的同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm for column subset
selection that combines the column-pivoted QR factorization with sparse
subspace embeddings. The proposed method, SE-QRSC, is particularly effective
for wide matrices with significantly more columns than rows. Starting from a
matrix $A$, the algorithm selects $k$ columns from the sketched matrix $B = A
\Omega^T$, where $\Omega$ is a sparse subspace embedding of
$\mathrm{range}(A^T)$. The sparsity structure of $\Omega$ is then exploited to
map the selected pivots back to the corresponding columns of $A$, which are
then used to produce the final subset of selected columns. We prove that this
procedure yields a factorization with strong rank-revealing properties, thus
revealing the spectrum of $A$. The resulting bounds exhibit a reduced
dependence on the number of columns of $A$ compared to those obtained from the
strong rank-revealing QR factorization of $A$. Moreover, when the leverage
scores are known, such as for orthogonal matrices, or can be efficiently
approximated, the bounds become entirely independent of the column dimension.
For general matrices, the algorithm can be extended by first applying an
additional subspace embedding of $range(A)$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接数值模拟波动力学方程(WKE)的新方法，基于共振曲面的分段多项式近似和数值积分，在2维非线性薛定谱模型中展示了二阶精度和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波动力学方程(WKEs)常用于描述非线性波动系统的综合平均波幅演化，需要有效的数值模拟方法来验证其准确性和应用范围。

Method: 采用共振曲面的分段多项式近似技术，继而进行碳积分的数值求解，对于2维空间非线性薛定谱模型进行了详细分析。

Result: 模型碳积分的详细收敛研究显示了二阶精度，WKE的自收敛研究显示近二阶收敛率，且通过与NLS系统综合平均的比较验证了方法的有效性和WKE的合理性。

Conclusion: 该新方法通用性强，在同性和异性解的情况下都显示了良好的效果，为WKE的直接数值模拟提供了有效的数值工具。

Abstract: Wave Kinetic Equations (WKEs) are often used to describe the evolution of
ensemble averaged wave amplitudes for nonlinear wave systems. In the present
manuscript we describe a new approach to direct numerical simulation of
solutions to WKEs. This new method relies on a piecewise polynomial
approximation of the resonant manifold, followed by numerical quadrature of the
collision integral. The approach is general in nature, and is discussed in
detail here for a particular nonlinear Schrodinger model in 2 spatial
dimensions. Detailed convergence studies demonstrate 2nd-order accuracy for
model collision integrals, and self-convergence studies for the WKE show near
2nd-order rates. Furthermore, comparison of the WKE approximation to ensemble
averages of the NLS illustrate the efficacy of the method and the validity of
the WKE, for both isotropic and an-isotropic solutions.

TL;DR: 提出一种变时间步长的线性松弛方案，用于解决时间分数阶相场方程，通过引入辅助变量和L1+-CN公式实现二次时间精度和能量稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间分数阶相场方程中非线性项的数值近似问题，避免IEQ和SAV方法中差分-代数方程的复杂性，并确保辅助变量与原变量的一致性。

Method: 使用L1+-CN公式进行分数导数离散化，引入辅助变量通过直接求解代数方程来近似非线性项，构建二次时间精度的半离散格式。

Result: 所建立的格式具有能量稳定性，当分数阶参数近似1时能量消散律与经典情形异曲同谨，辅助变量与原变量保持良好一致性且误差不随时间增长。

Conclusion: 该方案有效地处理了时间分数阶相场方程，实现了高精度、稳定性和辅助变量一致性，为相场模型的数值模拟提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a variable time-step linear relaxation scheme for
time-fractional phase-field equations with a free energy density in general
polynomial form. The $L1^{+}$-CN formula is used to discretize the fractional
derivative, and an auxiliary variable is introduced to approximate the
nonlinear term by directly solving algebraic equations rather than
differential-algebraic equations as in the invariant energy quadratization
(IEQ) and the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches. The developed
semi-discrete scheme is second-order accurate in time, and the inconsistency
between the auxiliary and the original variables does not deteriorate over
time. Furthermore, we take the time-fractional volume-conserved Allen-Cahn
equation, the time-fractional Cahn-Hilliard equation, and the time-fractional
Swift-Hohenberg equation as examples to demonstrate that the constructed
schemes are energy stable and that the discrete energy dissipation law is
asymptotically compatible with the classical one when the fractional-order
parameter $\alpha\rightarrow 1^{-}$. Several numerical examples demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme. In particular, numerical results confirm
that the auxiliary variable remains well aligned with the original variable,
and the error between them does not continue to increase over time before the
system reaches steady state.

### [113] [The Lifecycle Principle: Stabilizing Dynamic Neural Networks with State Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02575)
*Zichuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Lifecycle（LC）原则，通过状态记忆机制解决长期神经元失活带来的训练不稳定问题，提高了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法（如Dropout）只是临时改变神经元，而长期神经元失活会带来严重的训练不稳定问题，特别是当神经元重新激活时使用随机权重会导致破坏性的优化冲击。

Method: 提出LC原则，核心创新是状态记忆机制。当神经元重新激活时，不是重新初始化，而是恢复到上次有效的参数状态，从而保留已学知识并避免优化冲击。

Result: 理论分析表明LC原则能够平滑损失景观，引导优化趋向更平坦的最小值（与更好的泛化相关）。图像分类基准测试显示该方法提高了泛化能力和鲁棒性。消融研究证实状态记忆是实现这些增益的关键。

Conclusion: LC原则通过状态记忆机制有效解决了长期神经元失活带来的训练不稳定问题，显著提升了模型的泛化性能和鲁棒性，状态记忆是该方法的必要组成部分。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了组别敏感的阈值检测方法，通过为不同人口统计组设置不同的决策阈值，在类别不平衡问题上较合成数据生成方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的类别不平衡解决方案常带来新问题，需要找到更简单、更可解释且更有效的方法。

Method: 采用组别敏感的阈值检测技术，为不同的人口统计组设置不同的决策阈值，以优化平衡准确率和最差组平衡准确率之间的底特雷效率前沿。

Result: 经验验证显示，该方法比SMOTE和CT-GAN增广模型获得1.5-4%更高的平衡准确率，同时提高最差组平衡准确率。结果在7种模型家族中都得到了验证。

Conclusion: 组别敏感阈值检测提供了一种更简单、更可解释且更有效的类别不平衡解决方案，与合成数据生成方法存在基本重复性。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

Motivation: 公共卫生领域的序列资源分配问题具有复杂模糊的目标和有限的数据可用性，需要设计能够处理人类自然语言偏好表达中不确定性的鲁棒奖励函数

Method: 基于直接偏好优化(DPO)，采用轻量级的分布鲁棒优化(DRO)公式来考虑偏好分布的不确定性，相比之前的DRO-based DPO方法更加不保守

Result: 在ARMMAN的真实世界孕产妇移动健康项目和标准对齐基准测试中，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体在噪声偏好信号下表现出更好的鲁棒性，与基于自反思的基线方法性能相当但推理成本显著降低

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，能够在复杂公共卫生场景中处理偏好不确定性，同时保持较低的计算成本

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到在某些约束下，最优策略神经网络会出现类似神经冲击的"动作冲击"现象，动作选择层杆杆杆位置会收敛到单罐正交组架构

Method: 提出Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG)方法，在动作选择层中固定一个合成的单罐正交组(ETF)结构作为目标配置，促使策略网络产生理想的配置

Result: 在多个OpenAI Gym环境中证明，ACPG可以集成到任何离散策略梯度方法中，更快速、更稳健地实现更好的奖励收益

Conclusion: 通过预先设置ETF结构作为动作选择层的目标配置，可以有效地导向最优策略学习，提升策略梯度方法的效率和性能

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

TL;DR: 使用Mamba选择性状态空间模型作为基础模型，通过自监督重建任务和癫痫检测任务训练，在EEG数据分析中取得0.72 AUROC性能，为开发临床适用的EEG基础模型迈出重要一步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号具有噪声大、高维、非线性的特点，传统机器学习方法难以捕捉其复杂的时空动态特性，需要更先进的序列建模方法来提升神经疾病诊断能力。

Method: 基于Mamba的选择性状态空间模型，在大规模包含癫痫和非癫痫EEG记录的数据集上进行训练，采用自监督重建任务和癫痫检测任务的两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在保留测试集上达到了0.72的AUROC性能，证明了该模型在EEG癫痫检测任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了基础模型在EEG分析中的潜力，为开发大规模临床适用的EEG基础模型奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LExI是一种数据无关的MoE模型优化技术，通过自适应调整每层激活专家数量来提升推理效率，相比传统剪枝方法在保持精度的同时显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型通常在所有层中激活固定数量的专家，导致冗余计算和次优性能。传统剪枝方法虽然减少内存使用，但对GPU推理效率提升有限。

Method: LExI利用仅模型权重来估计每层的相对重要性，自适应地为每层分配最优激活专家数量，无需训练数据。

Result: 在语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI显著优于传统剪枝方法，推理效率大幅提升且精度损失可忽略。例如Qwen1.5-MoE在H100 GPU上达到相同吞吐量时精度提升10%。

Conclusion: LExI提供了一种有效的MoE模型推理优化方案，通过层间专家数量自适应分配解决了传统方法的局限性，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

Motivation: 为了解决从不同类型、不同稀疏度和分辨率的地下观测数据中重建地下属性的挑战，需要一个能够处理任意数量模态并支持灵活输入预测的模型。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth作为地球地下基础模型的初步框架，具有处理多模态数据和灵活预测的能力，为全球任意位置的地下属性预测奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测不确定性方法存在局限性：多假设预测缺乏原则性聚合，集成学习难以捕捉结构化模糊性，缺乏与损失几何一致的统一框架。

Method: 使用Bregman散度诱导的质心聚合连接多假设预测和集成学习，支持闭式最小二乘估计器和基于梯度的通用目标优化，提供可调多样性机制控制偏差-方差-多样性权衡。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多假设泛化和损失感知集成聚合之间的关系，并在深度学习预测器上研究了复杂度-容量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 结构化基函数网络填补了预测不确定性方法的空白，提供了统一的框架来处理结构化模糊性，并在不同难度数据集上展示了有效性。

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络(MPNN)在增加网络深度时容易出现过平滑风险，难以有效捕获全局和区域图结构信息。图拉普拉斯矩阵的低频特征向量编码了全局信息，预训练GNN预测这些特征向量可以促使网络自然学习大规模结构模式

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的图神经网络预训练方法，能够更好地捕获图结构的全局信息，相比现有主要关注领域特定任务（如节点或边特征重建）的预训练方法更具通用性和灵活性

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

TL;DR: JensUn是一种新的大语言模型遗忘方法，使用Jensen-Shannon散度作为训练目标，在遗忘效果和模型效用之间取得更好平衡，并提出了更精确的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法在严格评估下效果不佳，需要更有效的方法来安全删除私有数据或有害知识，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 提出JensUn方法，利用Jensen-Shannon散度作为训练目标，对遗忘集和保留集进行更稳定有效的遗忘动态训练。同时引入LKF数据集和基于LLM的语义评估框架。

Result: JensUn在实验中表现出比竞争方法更好的遗忘-效用权衡，对良性重新学习具有强韧性。新的评估框架显示许多现有方法效果不如预期。

Conclusion: JensUn提供了更有效的大语言模型遗忘解决方案，配合改进的评估方法，为安全可靠的模型遗忘提供了新途径。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了混合多数投票咆集成堆叠两种集成学习方法在肥胖风险预测中的性能，发现集成堆叠方法在复杂数据分布下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肥胖是全球急需关注的健康问题，与多种慢性疾病相关。机器学习在早期肥胖风险预测中显示了潜力，但对于混合多数投票咆集成堆叠这些集成技术的比较评估仍有限。

Method: 使用两个数据集评估三种集成模型：多数硬投票、加权硬投票咆堆叠（以多层感知机作为元分类器）。分析9种机器学习算法的50个超参数配置，选择前三个模型作为基学习器。预处理步骤包括数据集平衡咆离群点检测，以准确率咆F1分数评估模型性能。

Result: 在数据集1上，加权硬投票咆堆叠表现相近（准确率0.920304，F1 0.920070），超过多数硬投票。在数据集2上，堆叠方法表现最优（准确率0.989837，F1 0.989825），超过多数硬投票（准确率0.981707，F1 0.981675）咆加权硬投票。

Conclusion: 集成堆叠方法在复杂数据分布下提供了更强的预测能力，而混合多数投票仍是一个健壮的备选方案，为健康预测模型选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Conclusion: CPTC算法在最小假设条件下证明了有效性，能够更好地处理带突变点的时间序列不确定性量化问题

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的测试时计算(TTC)策略，通过在推理过程中利用计算资源来提高偏微分方程(PDE)模型的预测准确性，并减少训练数据和模型规模的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型存在自回归推度性能不佳、外部分布情况下表现差、计算资源和训练数据需求大等问题，限制了其在关键应用中的使用。

Method: 受大语言模型中"思考"策略的启发，提出了首个针对PDE的测试时计算策略，使用两种奖励模型来评估随机模型的预测结果，检验其时空一致性。

Conclusion: 这个TTC框架是向更高级PDE模建理解算法的基础步骤，包括构建基于强化学习的方法，有望转变物理和工程领域的计算工作流程。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Conclusion: SBICE框架通过引入参数不确定性和后验推理，为因果评估提供了更可靠的合成数据生成方法，解决了现有方法在参数表达和不确定性处理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Conclusion: PDRL提供了一种简单高效的后处理不确定性量化方案，适用于已训练模型且不影响预测准确性

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Conclusion: Vendi Score提供了一个灵活的多样性度量方法，VendiRL框架为学习多样化技能集提供了统一解决方案，有助于在不同环境中实现丰富的技能多样性。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Conclusion: AR-KAN模型成功解决了非周期信号分析问题，通过结合KAN网络和自回归方法的优势，为频谱分析提供了有效的混合解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

Motivation: 现有的拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法假设全客户端参与，但在实际通信约束和客户端可用性限制下，部分参与是更现实的场景。现有方法在采样客户端包含拜占庭多数时会立即失效。

Result: 建立了收敛保证，恢复了先前全参与结果，并匹配了部分参与设置下的基本下界。深度学习实验验证了理论发现，在各种拜占庭攻击下表现出稳定和鲁棒的训练性能。

Conclusion: D-Byz-SGDM方法有效解决了部分参与联邦学习中的拜占庭攻击问题，提供了理论保证和实验验证，为稀疏通信场景下的安全联邦学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化动量更新权重矩阵，在大语言模型训练中表现优异，但缺乏确定学习率的方法。而AdaGrad作为广泛使用的自适应方法，通过累积历史梯度来缩放随机梯度。需要结合两者的优势

Method: 提出AdaGO算法，将基于范数的AdaGrad型步长与正交化更新方向相结合。保持更新方向的正交性（可解释为谱下降方向），同时通过累积梯度范数缩放方向来适应优化景观。实现只需对Muon进行最小修改，增加一个标量变量（累积平方梯度范数）

Result: 在非凸函数的随机和确定性设置下建立了最优理论收敛速率。在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归任务上的实证结果表明，AdaGO优于Muon和Adam

Conclusion: AdaGO成功结合了正交化更新和自适应步长的优势，在计算和内存效率高的前提下，实现了更好的优化性能，为大规模语言模型训练提供了有效的优化器选择

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠分期模型在面对未见过的生理学特征或记录条件时性能会下降，需要一种实用的实时自适应方法来解决部署时的领域偏移问题。

Method: 结合熵最小化(Tent)和批量归一化统计刷新，采用两个安全机制：熵门控在不确定窗口暂停适应，EMA重置机制防止漂移。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF Expanded数据集上，使用单导联EEG数据，相比冻结基线模型获得了持续的性能提升，具有秒级延迟和最小内存占用。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关、无需源数据或患者校准，适用于设备端或床边使用，为睡眠分期的实时自适应提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

Result: 多模态训练显著提高预测准确性，训练完成后只需吸收率数据即可准确预测熔池动力学，无需X射成像

Conclusion: 该多模态融合方法能够实现成本效益高的实时监控，在增材制造领域具有广泛的应用前景

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: 该算法能够高效学习平均场游戏的Nash均衡，适用于复杂的初始条件和噪声环境，为大规模多代理系统提供了强大的解决方案

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

Conclusion: LimiX证明了单一模型处理多样化表格任务的可行性，为结构化数据基础模型的发展奠定了基础

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物理知识融入符号回归方法需要专业知识和手工特征工程，限制了普通研究者的使用。通过LLMs自动化知识融入，可以扩展方法的适用范围

Method: 将LLMs集成到SR损失函数中，添加LLM对生成方程的评价项。使用三种SR算法(DEAP, gplearn, PySR)和三种LLMs(Falcon, Mistral, LLama 2)，在三种物理动力学问题上进行实验

Result: LLM集成一致提高了从数据重构物理动力学的性能，增强了SR模型对噪声和复杂性的稳健性。更信息丰富的提示语显著提高了性能

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs可以有效地自动化物理知识融入符号回归过程，为更广泛的科学问题提供了更可访的自动化科学发现方法

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

Motivation: 解决LLM模型内存和计算资源需求大的问题，但传统二进制量化导致性能显著下降，需要新方法来缩小与4毕特量化方法的性能差距

Method: 提出了专门为二进制量化设计的新优化目标，以及三种实现算法，通过动态识别最优非结构子矩阵和适应性分组策略来改进块量化

Result: 平均比特长度仅为1.007比特，LLaMA 3.2 3B模型语言混乱度从原始7.81降至8.23，显著超越之前SOTA BiLLM模型（123.90），且性能与GPTQ等4毕特量化方法相当，量化过程高效（仅需14秒）

Conclusion: 该方法在极端压缩比例（1毕特）下仍能保持高模型质量，解决了二进制量化的性能下降问题，为LLM模型的高效部署提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了ReLU转换图(RTG)框架，提出了一个全面的图论模型来分析深度ReLU网络。该模型将线性激活区域表示为节点，通过ReLU激活翻转连接相邻区域，揭示了网络功能行为的离散几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了深入理解深度ReLU网络的泛化能力，需要建立一个统一的框架来分析网络的功能几何结构。传统方法难以捕捉ReLU网络的离散特性，因此需要开发新的图论工具来研究网络的区域连接性和结构特性。

Method: 构建ReLU转换图(RTG)模型，其中节点代表线性激活区域，边连接仅相差单个ReLU激活翻转的区域。通过理论分析随机初始化RTG的扩展性、度分布和谱特性，并实证构建小网络的RTG来测量平滑性和连通性。

Result: 理论证明随机初始化的RTG具有强扩展性、二项式度分布和紧密控制泛化的谱特性。实证结果显示区域熵在过参数化下饱和，谱间隙与泛化相关，相邻区域间的KL散度反映功能平滑性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个通过离散功能几何视角分析ReLU网络的统一框架，为理解、诊断和改进泛化提供了新工具，揭示了网络结构特性与泛化性能之间的深刻联系。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous

landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

Motivation: 现有的DRL交通信号控制方法存在两种范式："选择相位"范式可能导致意外的相位序列，影响驾驶员预期和安全性；"切换"范式虽然保持可预测的顺序，但可能导致不公平和低效的相位分配。需要一种既能保持可预测性又能灵活分配时间的方法。

Conclusion: DHCP模型通过分层周期规划的方法，有效解决了传统DRL交通信号控制方法的局限性，在保持相位顺序可预测性的同时实现了更灵活和高效的交通信号时间分配。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Conclusion: 该AI驱动方法具有强大的潜力，适用于无标准物质或需要快速现场分析的场景

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

Motivation: 验证和信任自动驾驶等安全关键应用中的AI模型，需要可解释AI(XAI)，但Rashomon效应(多个准确模型提供不同解释)挑战了XAI的可靠性。

Method: 使用谨谨可解释图(QXGs)作为符号场景表示，训练了两类Rashomon集合模型：可解释的基于对的梯度提升模型和复杂的图神经网络(GNNs)，并使用特征归因方法测量解释一致性。

Result: 结果显示了显著的解释不一致性，解释模糊性是问题本身的内在属性，而不仅仅是模型建模的人工故障。

Conclusion: 解释的多样性和不确定性是自动驾驶场景动作预测问题的内在特征，这对XAI在安全关键应用中的可靠性构成了重要挑战。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Conclusion: 完整的公平性决策树设计空间包含三种主要方案，新提出的回溯约束方案和双树方案为公平机器学习领域提供了更多的设计选择和解决方案。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

Motivation: 传统的GCSL方法存在两个主要问题：(1)仅从自身经验学习会加剧智能体的固有偏见；(2)目标重标记策略使智能体只关注成功结果，无法从错误中学习。

Method: 将对比学习原理整合到GCSL框架中，使智能体能够同时从成功和失败的经验中学习，促进更有效的探索行为。

Conclusion: 整合对比学习的GCSL框架能够有效解决自模仿学习的局限性，通过从成功和失败中学习，提升智能体的探索能力和整体性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有LoRA风格适配器在高表达性和参数效率之间的权衡问题，高秩适配器需要更多参数，而向量化方法参数效率高但表达能力有限

Method: 使用类Tucker张量网络参数化权重更新矩阵，冻结大型随机初始化因子并在层间共享，仅训练由对角因子矩阵条目组成的小型层特定缩放向量

Result: TeRA在性能上匹配甚至超越高秩适配器，同时所需的可训练参数数量与向量化方法相当

Conclusion: TeRA成功实现了高秩权重更新与参数效率的平衡，理论分析和消融研究验证了方法的有效性

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件检测评估指标（如F1和F1$_{pa}$）在真实世界不均衡数据集中常导致性能评估偏差，特别是当地面真实为单点注释而实际现象是渐进过程时

Method: 提出了窗口基F1指标F1$_w$，通过引入时间宽容性来更加稳健地评估事件检测性能，并在三个生理数据集（ADARP、Wrist Angel、ROAD）进行实证分析

Result: 实验结果显示F1$_w$能够揭示传统指标无法发现的有意义模型性能模式，在两个野外应用场景中，只有时间宽容性指标能显示TimesFM预测结果较随机和空基准有统计显著改善

Conclusion: 评估指标的选择强烈影响对模型性能的解释，F1$_w$指标填补了时间序列评估的关键空白，为健康应用领域提供了实用指南，可根据领域知识调整窗口大小避免高估

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: TopoMap是一种黑盒、模型无关的深度学习方法，通过降维和聚类创建输入特征空间的拓扑地图，自动选择最优配置来区分不同故障特征，在突变测试中比随机选择效果提升35-61%。

Result: TopoMap生成的拓扑地图包含可区分且有意义的区域，在突变测试中比随机选择平均提升35%的可杀死突变体检测效果，对不可杀死突变体提升61%。

Conclusion: TopoMap提供了一种有效的方法来创建DL模型输入特征空间的拓扑地图，能够识别不同的故障特征区域，显著提高了突变测试的效率。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Conclusion: FoMEMO为昂贵多目标优化提供了新的解决方案，通过合成数据预训练的基础模型实现了对未知问题的卓越适应性和高效优化。

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

TL;DR: HyPV-LEAD是一个用于加密货币异常交易早期检测的框架，通过窗口-时间建模、峰谷采样和双曲嵌入技术，在比特币交易数据上实现了0.9624的PR-AUC性能，显著优于现有方法。

Motivation: 加密货币异常交易（如混币服务、欺诈转账、拉盘砸盘）对金融完整性构成日益增长的风险，但现有方法主要是模型中心化和事后检测，缺乏预防价值，且面临类别不平衡、时间波动性和复杂网络依赖等挑战。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于流匹配的生成框架，用于建模分岔现象中的多模态概率分布，能够直接采样多个有效解并保持系统对称性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性动力系统中的分岔现象会产生多个共存稳定解，但确定性机器学习模型难以捕捉这种多重性，往往对解进行平均而无法表示低对称性结果

Method: 基于流匹配的生成框架，引入对称匹配策略，在群作用下对齐预测和目标输出，实现等变设置下的准确学习

Result: 在从玩具模型到复杂物理问题（如屈曲梁和Allen-Cahn方程）的一系列系统上验证，流匹配在捕捉多模态分布和对称破缺分岔方面显著优于非概率和变分方法

Conclusion: 为高维系统中的多稳态建模提供了原则性和可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对差分隐私生成模型（GANs和扩散模型）的隐私风险进行了统一的理论和实证分析，发现GANs在抵抗成员推理攻击方面具有结构性优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GANs和扩散模型都可以在差分隐私下训练以保护敏感数据，但它们对成员推理攻击的敏感性仍然未被充分理解，这是数据保密性的关键威胁。

Method: 通过稳定性分析比较GANs和扩散模型对数据扰动的敏感性，并使用标准化的MIA流程进行全面的实证研究，评估不同数据集和隐私预算下的隐私泄露情况。

Result: 研究结果显示GANs表现出显著较低的隐私泄露风险，即使在强差分隐私机制下，GANs相比扩散模型具有明显的隐私鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: 模型类型本身对隐私泄露具有关键影响，GANs在抵抗成员推理攻击方面具有结构性优势，这为选择隐私保护的生成模型提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Motivation: 表位是免疫治疗和疫苗开发的关键，但合成表位库的设计面临组合序列空间巨大的挑战，传统筛选方法不可行

Method: 预训练蛋白质数据的语言模型epiGPTope，在线性表位上微调，直接生成表位样序列；训练统计分类器预测表位来源

Conclusion: 生成式与预测式模型结合的方法仅需氨基酸序列，无需几何框架或手工特征，可加速表位发现和生物技术应用

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索夏令时实践对不同国家睡眠时长的影响，以及地理位置在这一关系中的调节作用

Method: 采用61个国家的睡眠数据，进行统计相关分析，按DST实施情况分组，通过可视化比较不同组别的睡眠模式

Result: DST实施国家平均睡眠时长更长，但经度会调节这一效应：低经度区DST国家睡眠更短于非DST国家，高经度区则相反

Conclusion: 夏令时对睡眠的影响受到地理位置的调节，经度在DST与睡眠时长的关系中起关键作用

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

Conclusion: 本文为多假设情况下的似然函数校准提供了理论框架，扩展了传统的二元校准方法，并通过机器学习应用验证了其有效性，为概率模型的校准提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

TL;DR: 通过先聚类后分开嵌入再对齐的模块化方法，解决t-SNE和UMAP在保持局部信息时扭曲全局几何结构的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等维度降低方法虽然能够进行数据可视化并保持局部信息，但容易扭曲数据的全局几何结构，需要更透明的方法来解决这个问题

Method: 提出一种模块化方法：首先对数据进行聚类，然后对每个聚类分别进行嵌入，最后将各聚类嵌入结果进行对齐以获得全局嵌入

Result: 在多个合成和实际数据集上进行了实验，证明该方法与现有方法相比具有竞争力，同时更加透明

Conclusion: 模块化聚类-嵌入-对齐方法提供了一种更透明的解决方案，在保持局部信息的同时能够更好地保持全局几何结构

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

Motivation: 肿毛病治疗中液体和升压药的使用量决策很关键但复杂，虽然自动化RL方法有前景，但以往研究依赖关系数据。现代医疗数据的复杂性要求更好的数据表征方法。

Result: 实验评估证实了图基方法的潜力，同时也显示了该领域表征学习的复杂性。

Conclusion: 图数据表征方法在肿毛病治疗决策中具有潜力，但表征学习的复杂性需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR中的结果奖励模型(ORMs)过于粗粒度，无法区分正确答案中的错误推理或错误答案中的有效推理，而过程奖励模型(PRMs)虽然提供细粒度指导但存在不准确性和奖励攻击问题。

Method: 提出PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择来协调PRM和ORM的互补优势，保留具有较高平均过程值的正确响应和具有较低平均过程值的错误响应，同时保持正负训练样本平衡。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比混合方法持续提高最终准确率超过4%，同时增强了中间推理步骤的质量。

Conclusion: PROF通过有效的数据过程筛选方法，成功解决了细粒度过程奖励和粗粒度结果奖励之间的协调问题，显著提升了数学推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

Motivation: KANs作为一种新兴的神经网络架构，虽然在各领域表现出色，但其初始化策略尚未得到充分研究，这限制了其性能的进一步提升。

Method: 提出了两种理论驱动的初始化方案（LeCun和Glorot启发式）和一个可调指数的经验幂律初始化家族，通过大规模网格搜索、NTK分析和Feynman数据集评估进行验证。

Result: Glorot启发的初始化在参数丰富的模型中显著优于基线，而幂律初始化在所有任务和不同规模架构中均表现最佳。

Conclusion: 精心设计的初始化策略对KANs性能至关重要，幂律初始化方法展现出最强的整体性能，为KANs的实际应用提供了有效的初始化方案。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

Conclusion: Robult框架具有轻量级设计和良好可扩展性，能够无缝集成到现有架构中，适用于实际多模态应用场景。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术能大幅降低DP-SGD训练的时间和能耗成本，但研究发现量化在DP-SGD中会导致比普通SGD更严重的精度下降，这是由于噪声注入放大了量化方差。

Method: 提出QPQuant动态量化框架：1）每轮epoch概率性采样选择要量化的层子集；2）使用差分隐私损失敏感度估计器进行损失感知层优先化，识别对模型质量影响最小的层进行量化。

Result: 在ResNet18、ResNet50和DenseNet121上的实验表明，QPQuant优于静态量化基线，达到接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡，理论吞吐量提升最高达2.21倍，验证精度下降小于2%。

Conclusion: QPQuant通过动态层量化和损失感知优先化有效解决了DP-SGD中量化方差放大的问题，在保持差分隐私保护的同时显著提升了低精度硬件上的训练效率。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准测试中，基于功能组抽象的结构监督能够产生与真实生化注释高度一致的相互作用预测

Conclusion: LINKER仅需序列级输入即可进行大规模应用，在缺乏结构数据的场景中具有重要价值

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.

### [179] [On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03493)
*Han Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对LLM-RL训练中传统熵正则化效果不佳的问题，提出了AEnt方法，通过钳位熵奖励和自动调整系数来改善探索效果，在数学推理任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化在机器人控制和游戏RL中有效，但在LLM-RL训练中效果微弱甚至无效，主要原因是LLM响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏。

Method: 提出AEnt方法：使用钳位熵奖励（在较小的token空间上计算重归一化策略的熵），并自动调整熵系数，以在紧凑响应集中鼓励探索同时控制熵引起的偏差。

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上的数学推理任务测试中，AEnt方法始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AEnt通过改进的熵控制机制有效解决了LLM-RL中的探索问题，为大规模语言模型的强化学习训练提供了更有效的熵正则化方案。

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

*Erkan Bayram,Mohamed-Ali Belabbas,Tamer Başar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了Tuning without Forgetting (TwF)方法中的参数子空间在非奇异控制下构成有限余维Banach子流形，并刻画了其切空间，为TwF在顺序训练中精确保持映射提供了理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为之前提出的TwF方法提供严格的理论基础，证明其在顺序训练中能够精确保持先前学习样本的端点映射，而不仅仅是一阶近似意义下的保持。

Method: 通过数学分析证明在非奇异控制条件下，TwF方法中的参数子空间构成有限余维Banach子流形，并详细刻画该子流形的切空间结构。

Result: 证明了TwF对应的参数子空间确实形成Banach子流形，其切空间特性解释了TwF能够实现精确映射保持的机制，超越了之前的一阶近似理解。

Conclusion: 该研究为TwF方法提供了坚实的数学理论基础，表明该方法通过沿着Banach子流形切空间的连续变形，能够在顺序训练中精确保持先前学习到的映射关系。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp算法为高比例低资源边缘设备的系统提供了有效的解决方案，能够充分利用原本被排除的数据资源，提升联邦学习性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Conclusion: 研究识别了更具不变性的特征表示，增强了地理迁移能力，为在全球多样化区域实现可扩展、低成本的作物类型应用提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at
