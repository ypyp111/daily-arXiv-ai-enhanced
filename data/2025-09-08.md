TL;DR: 通过驾驶模拟器实验研究自动驾驶风险感知，发现车辆运动和皮电导可以预测主观风险感知，而面部表情识别效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动驾驶车辆的风险感知对公众接受度的重要影响，希望找到客观评估风险感知的方法。

Method: 使用32名参与者进行驾驶模拟器实验，测量主观舒适度、车辆运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率和眼动跟踪。对比两种驾驶风格和行人跨路情景。

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强的不舒适感，行人跨路会加剧这种效应。面部表情识别效果不好，但使用车辆运动和皮电导的神经网络模型能够有效预测风险感知。

Conclusion: 车辆运动和皮电导可以作为客观评估自动驾驶风险感知的有效方法，减少主观偏差，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个通用的提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，显著提升文本到图像生成模型对复杂提示词的理解和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时经常出现属性绑定、否定和组合关系等方面的失败，导致用户意图与生成结果不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，使用专门的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，基于24个关键点的系统分类法进行优化。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在各种语义和组合挑战中显著改善了图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不修改预训练模型权重的情况下提升任何文本到图像模型的性能，并引入了新的人类偏好基准来促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，基于SD3.5-Medium架构改进，通过渐进式双任务强化策略实现了最先进的图像生成和编辑能力，并在多模态统一框架中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源多模态模型过于注重参数规模扩展而忽视了训练策略优化，导致效率和性能受限。需要开发更高效的训练方法来提升模型能力。

Method: 1) 对SD3.5-Medium进行架构改进和大规模高质量数据预训练；2) 提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)分阶段增强指令跟随和编辑一致性；3) 通过连接器将图像模型与Qwen2.5-VL-7B连接进行联合训练，构建统一多模态模型。

Result: 模型在图像生成和编辑方面超越了参数规模更大的模型(BAGEL 7B和Flux-Kontext 12B)，验证了不同任务的强化阶段具有相互促进作用且不会产生负面干扰。

Conclusion: 提出的Skywork UniPic 2.0训练范式具有有效性和通用性，能够实现理解、生成和编辑的统一集成，在多样化任务中达到顶级性能，且训练范式简单可扩展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于像素空间双向变形和图像修复的拖拽式图像编辑框架，实现了实时变形预览和高效修复，相比现有方法大幅提升了交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽式图像编辑方法主要依赖生成模型的潜在空间操作，导致精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定约束。需要一种更直接、高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向变形和图像修复两个步骤，将图像区域视为可变形材料，通过弹性物体变形原理实现自然形状保持。

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现实时变形预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)，相比需要数分钟编辑的现有方法显著提升交互体验，并可作为通用适配器支持任何修复模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持实时性能的同时实现了卓越的视觉质量和精确控制，为拖拽式图像编辑提供了更高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是首个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生与修正"策略，通过扩散模型生成良性图像来消除对抗补丁攻击，无需预先了解攻击补丁信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的物体检测器仍然容易受到对抗补丁攻击，这些攻击可以在现实世界中隐藏实际物体或创建不存在物体，造成严重后果。需要一个有效、通用且能抵抗自适应攻击的防御方法。

Method: 利用扩散模型的分布内生成能力重新生成整个图像，使其与良性数据对齐，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗区域为重新生成的良性对应部分。

Result: 在多个检测器和攻击方法上的实验表明，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的mAP.5最佳分数，在非目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低至24.8%，且对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DISPATCH是一个实用可靠的物体检测系统防御方案，具有攻击无关性，无需先验知识，在各种攻击场景下都优于现有最先进防御方法。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个从单目视频重建全局人体运动的统一框架，通过创新的航向角分解技术和相机轨迹整合机制，解决了相机方向信息利用不足和相机平移线索整合困难的问题，在野外基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从野外单目视频重建全局人体运动在VR、图形和机器人应用中需求日益增长，但面临深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠等挑战。现有以人体运动为中心的方法在利用相机方向信息和整合相机平移线索方面存在不足。

Method: 提出WATCH框架：1）引入解析性航向角分解技术，比现有几何方法更高效和可扩展；2）设计受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，有效利用相机平移信息；3）联合建模相机-人体运动关系。

Result: 在野外基准测试中，WATCH在端到端轨迹重建方面达到了最先进的性能，证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新见解，展示了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个简单有效的显著性感知框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索来解决密集视频字幕任务中的两个关键问题，在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端密集视频字幕模型存在两个局限：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，而将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：显著性感知视频重加权（将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重）和基于语义的自适应字幕检索（通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索）。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过联合改进视频加权和检索机制，显著提升了密集视频字幕任务的性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [9] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个新颖的视觉骨干网络，结合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和Mamba SSM的全局建模能力，在ImageNet和ADE20K上取得了优异的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决ViTs和SSMs在捕获细粒度局部特征方面的不足，以及CNNs缺乏全局推理能力的问题，需要设计一个能够同时利用CNN局部特征优势和Mamba全局建模能力的混合架构。

Method: 采用卷积stem和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取丰富的局部特征，后期阶段使用多方向Mamba块来高效建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度。

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K上达到82.6% top-1准确率，比PlainMamba-L3高0.3%且参数减少37%；在ADE20K上获得47.1 mIoU，比EfficientFormer-L7高2.0 mIoU且参数减少62%。

Conclusion: VCMamba成功整合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的特征表示能力，为视觉任务提供了高效的骨干网络解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at
https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构确保语义分割结果严格遵循复杂的文本标注指南


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的语义分割不仅需要准确的分割掩码，还必须严格遵守复杂的文本标注指南。传统方法需要昂贵的任务特定重训练，而现有的开放词汇分割方法在处理段落级复杂指南时表现不佳

Method: 多智能体训练免费框架，包含Worker执行分割、Supervisor根据检索到的指南进行批判、轻量级强化学习停止策略决定循环终止时机

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上显著优于最先进的基线方法，展示了强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决复杂标注指南的遵循问题，在保证分割质量的同时平衡资源使用，为现实应用中的语义分割提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种技术解决不同传感器配置间的3D目标检测领域适应问题：下游微调和部分层微调，在相同地理区域的多传感器配置数据集上表现优于简单联合训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同车辆平台部署不同的传感器配置导致点云分布变化，使在一个配置上训练的模型应用到另一个配置时性能下降，而现有研究主要关注环境领域差距和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，不同传感器配置间的领域差距尚未充分探索

Method: 提出下游微调（多数据集训练后的数据集特定微调）和部分层微调（仅更新部分层以提高跨配置泛化能力），使用相同地理区域收集的多个传感器配置配对数据集进行联合训练

Result: 下游微调和部分层微调的联合训练在每种配置上都一致优于简单的联合训练

Conclusion: 为将3D目标检测模型适应到多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

TL;DR: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间建模，用于遥感图像云检测，有效处理局部空间依赖和长程大气相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像常被云层遮挡，影响数据完整性。云检测需要同时处理短程空间冗余和长程大气相似性，现有方法难以兼顾局部空间依赖和长程依赖关系。

Method: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，集成卷积神经网络（处理局部空间依赖）和Mamba状态空间建模（处理长程依赖），构建统一的云检测网络，同时捕获像素级纹理细节和长程块级依赖。

Result: 大量实验验证了CD-Mamba的有效性，证明其在检测精度上优于现有方法，能够有效处理不同空间尺度的云检测任务。

Conclusion: CD-Mamba通过结合卷积和Mamba的优势，成功解决了云检测中局部和长程依赖关系的建模问题，为遥感图像云检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

Method: 提出TCT框架，包含主分割头（MSH）和多个辅助任务头（ATHs），通过一致性约束利用未标注解剖结构，采用过滤策略排除低一致性噪声数据，以及统一辅务不确定性加权损失（UAUWL）减轻特定任务占主导的问题

Result: 在8个来自不同临床机构的腹部数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: TCT框架能够有效解决医学图像分割中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，通过一致性约束和智能过滤策略提高分割性能

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

*Dharsan Ravindran,Kevin Wang,Zhuoyuan Cao,Saleh Abdelrahman,Jeffery Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下分割性能不佳的问题，提出了两种不确定性感知方法来提升自动驾驶场景的分割鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏不确定性量化。受医学影像中不确定性感知训练在模糊情况下提升可靠性的启发，研究旨在增强自动驾驶分割的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2）将医学影像分割中的不确定性感知适配器（UAT）适配到驾驶场景。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明，UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，而带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在不同驾驶场景中都获得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在具有挑战性的环境中，显式的不确定性建模对于安全关键的自动驾驶具有重要价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity
Recognition (HAR), a system that runs entirely on smartwatches in unconstrained
environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component

a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

TL;DR: MCANet是一个多标签分类框架，用于飓风后无人机图像损伤评估，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定注意力机制，在RescueNet数据集上达到91.75% mAP，优于多个基准模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，无法有效区分视觉相似或共现的损伤类型，影响飓风后快速准确的灾害评估

Method: 采用Res2Net分层主干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文，结合多头类别特定残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度，平衡局部细节和全局上下文

Result: 在4,494张无人机图像数据集上达到91.75% mAP，使用8个注意力头时提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%

Conclusion: MCANet能有效定位损伤相关区域，支持可解释性，输出可用于灾后风险制图、应急路由和数字孪生灾害响应，未来可整合知识图谱和多模态大语言模型提升适应性

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测复杂人群时，不仅需要局部外观特征，还需要全局场景上下文和时间一致性，而传统方法假设群体在视频中不变化

Method: 使用groupness增强的CLIP特征提取器，通过视觉-语言模型获取每帧的局部和全局特征，然后统一使用图过滤器进行全局优化以保持时间一致性

Result: 在公开数据集上超越了现有的最先进群体检测方法

Conclusion: 通过结合局部特征、全局上下文和时间一致性的全局优化方法，能够有效检测视频中动态变化的人群

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

TL;DR: FloodVision是一个零样本洪水深度估计框架，结合GPT-4o的视觉语言能力和结构化知识图谱，通过识别参考物体和物理尺寸来准确估计洪水深度，在110张图像上达到8.17厘米的平均绝对误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法在洪水检测中存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，主要依赖固定物体检测器和特定任务训练，需要开发能够跨不同洪水场景准确估计深度的通用方法。

Method: 结合基础视觉语言模型GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，知识图谱编码常见城市物体的标准物理尺寸。动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，检索验证高度，估计淹没比例，应用统计异常值过滤计算最终深度值。

Result: 在MyCoast New York的110张众包图像上评估，FloodVision达到8.17厘米的平均绝对误差，比GPT-4o基线(10.28厘米)降低20.5%，优于先前的CNN方法。系统在不同场景中泛化良好，接近实时运行。

Conclusion: FloodVision为零样本洪水深度估计提供了准确且通用的解决方案，适合未来集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，增强智慧城市的洪水韧性。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Motivation: 解决文本-视频检索任务中双塔框架效果差和单塔框架效率低的问题，希望同时实现高效果和高效率

Method: 提出PIG方法，包含伪查询生成器为每个视频生成伪查询，使视频特征和文本特征能够进行细粒度交互，在推理阶段不增加额外计算开销

Result: 在五个常用基准测试上R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与双塔模型相当，性能接近最先进水平

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了双塔和单塔框架的优势，实现了效果和效率的双重提升

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Motivation: 准确的月球图像注册对月球探测至关重要，但多模态感器数据在分辨率、照明和形变方面存在差异，导致注册困难。

Method: 构建预处理流水线（包括地理参考、分辨率对齐、强度归一化等），并在赤道和极地区域的跨模态图像对上评测SIFT、ASIFT、AKAZE、RIFT2和SuperGlue五种算法。

Result: SuperGlue深度学习方法一贵获得最低的均方根误差和最快的运行时间。经典方法如SIFT和AKAZE在赤道附近表现良好但在极地照明条件下性能下降。

Conclusion: 预处理和基于学习的方法对于在多样化条件下实现稳健的月球图像注册至关重要，SuperGlue在跨模态月球图像匹配中表现最优。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion

Motivation: 提高计算机视觉模型在安全关键应用（如交通场景感知）中的可靠性，需要准确且良好校准的预测不确定性估计。

Method: 研究三种从MoE中提取预测不确定性的方法：预测熵、互信息和专家方差，并在A2D2数据集上使用两个专家的MoE进行评估。

Result: MoE比集成方法产生更可靠的不确定性估计，简单门控机制比复杂类门控具有更好的路由不确定性校准，增加专家数量可进一步提升不确定性校准。

Conclusion: 混合专家模型是量化预测不确定性的有效方法，能够提供良好校准的不确定性估计，特别适用于安全关键的应用场景。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Motivation: 医学MRI图像在切片方向上通常具有较低的空间分辨率，需要高质量的上采样方法来提升图像质量，同时保持解剖细节和纹理信息。

Method: 结合Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers和卷积层构建SRGAN架构，在切片方向进行上采样，使用MSSEG2数据集训练，并在多个临床数据集上进行验证。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在复杂光场数据中存在特征提取效率低下和冗余问题，且状态空间在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)；采用双阶段建模：第一阶段用SA-RSMB进行浅层空间-角度特征提取，第二阶段用EPMB和EPTB双分支并行结构进行深度极线特征精炼

Result: LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上显著优于当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升

Conclusion: LFMT框架成功整合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，能够全面探索空间、角度和极线平面域的信息，为光场超分辨率任务提供了高效且高性能的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

Method: 提出PropVG框架，包含对比参考评分(CRS)模块（在句子和单词级别进行对比学习）和多粒度目标判别(MTD)模块（融合对象和语义级信息）。

Result: 在gRefCOCO、Ref-ZOM、R-RefCOCO和RefCOCO等多个基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PropVG成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过集成proposal生成和目标理解，结合对比学习和多粒度判别，显著提升了视觉定位性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无需姿态信息的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了对任意形状细胞的高通量流式细胞术断层成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D定量相位成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转且需要已知每个帧的姿态，这限制了方法对近球形细胞的适用性，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，只能分析细胞群体的子集。

Method: 利用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，在弱散射假设下联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，支持任意细胞几何形状和多轴旋转。

Result: 能够从稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖中实现准确重建，仅需10个视图或120度角度范围即可获得高保真结果。

Conclusion: OmniFHT首次实现了对整个流动细胞群体的原位高通量断层成像，为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏的无标记形态计量分析解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS是一种用于移动机器人的语义3D高斯重建方法，通过粗粒度语义分割和颜色过滤来快速隔离感兴趣对象，将训练时间减少到完整训练的约四分之一，同时保持高质量的新视角合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动自主机器人应用（如远程指导和灾难响应）需要快速准确的3D重建。传统方法重建整个场景效率低下，而关注特定感兴趣对象（PoIs）更为高效。高斯溅射（GS）技术虽然能提供高质量3D表示，但完整训练周期耗时较长。

Method: 提出CoRe-GS方法：首先使用语义高斯溅射生成粗粒度可分割场景，然后通过新颖的基于颜色的有效过滤方法对语义对象进行精炼，实现有效的对象隔离。

Result: 在两个数据集（SCRREAM真实户外场景和NeRDS 360合成室内场景）上评估，显示运行时间显著减少，训练时间约为完整语义高斯溅射训练的四分之一，同时新视角合成质量更高。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法成功平衡了高质量重建和减少训练时间的需求，通过早期语义分割和颜色过滤技术，为移动机器人应用提供了快速准确的3D对象重建解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

TL;DR: Cryo-RL是一个基于强化学习的冷冻消融针放置规划框架，通过模拟临床环境和奖励函数学习最优放置策略，在583例前列腺癌病例中表现优于自动化基线方法，达到专家水平且规划时间大幅减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前列腺癌冷冻消融治疗的手术前规划依赖专家经验，过程耗时且结果不一致，需要自动化解决方案来提高治疗质量和可扩展性。

Method: 将冷冻消融针放置规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在模拟临床约束和术中变异性的环境中，通过强化学习代理顺序选择冷冻消融针位置和冰球直径，基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数指导学习最优策略。

Result: 在583例回顾性前列腺癌病例评估中，Cryo-RL相比基于几何优化的最佳自动化基线方法，Dice系数提高了8个百分点以上，达到人类专家水平，且规划时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Motivation: 为开发能够根据患者反应动态调整治疗刺激的自适应性计算机化暴露治疗系统

Method: 采用转移学习方法调整三个预训练计算机视觉模型，使其能够根据313张标准化蜘蛛图片预测人类恐惧评分（0-100分度）

Result: 模型通过交叉验证获得平均绝对误差（MAE）在10.1到11.0之间，解释性分析显示模型基于蜘蛛相关特征进行预测，远距离视角和人造蜘蛛图片导致误差更高

Conclusion: 证明了可解释计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧情感方面的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和足够数据集规模对开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Motivation: 工业磨损检测对预测性维护至关重要，但真实数据收集成本高、时间长，且缺乏多样化的磨损场景数据集

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和3D模拟渲染引擎，为不同的生销条件生成合成数据

Result: 使用合成数据训练的检测模型在真实生销工业物体图像上达到了0.87的mAP50分数，超过其他方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了工业磨损检测数据缺乏问题，具有可定制性并可扩展到其他工业磨损检测场景

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

TL;DR: 一种简单的注意力基础多实例学习框架用于自动化皮腺细胞图像分析，对比基线MLP模型显示简单的集合方法更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动计数皮腺细胞内部的油滴耗时费力且主观，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用Nile Red染色的皮腺细胞图像，分为14个滴数类别，通过数据增广扩展到约50,000个细胞。对比了基于聚合片区计数的MLP模型和使用ResNet-50特征的注意力MIL模型。

Result: 五折交叉验证显示，基线MLP达到更稳定性能（平均MAE=5.6），注意力MIL模型不如其稳定（平均MAE=10.7）但在某些折叠中更优。

Conclusion: 简单的集合方法为皮腺细胞滴数计数提供了稳健基线，注意力MIL需要任务对齐池化和正则化才能充分发挥潜力。

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

TL;DR: UniView是一个新颖的单图像新视角合成模型，通过检索相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，解决了传统方法在未观察区域生成时产生的严重失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务由于未观察区域存在多种解释而高度不适定，现有方法通常基于模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值生成未见区域，这往往导致严重失真。

Method: 1) 构建检索和增强系统，利用多模态大语言模型辅助选择符合要求的参考图像；2) 引入具有多级隔离层的即插即用适配器模块，动态为目标视图生成参考特征；3) 设计解耦的三重注意力机制，有效对齐和整合多分支特征以保留原始输入图像的细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2替代线性映射器，显著提升了视频到音频生成的训练效率和性能，仅需16%的训练量即可达到竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法训练成本高，需要利用基础模型的跨模态知识转移能力。受先前轻量级映射器方法的启发，希望开发更高效的映射架构。

Method: 提出多基础模型映射器(MFM-Mapper)：1)融合双视觉编码器的语义和时序特征；2)用GPT-2替代线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务。

Result: 在语义和时序一致性方面表现更好，训练效率显著提升，仅需先前映射器方法16%的训练量，就能达到与更大规模训练模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper通过特征融合和GPT-2映射器的创新设计，实现了高效的视频到音频生成，为跨模态生成任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

Motivation: 现有红外-可见光图像融合方法假设高质量输入，难以处理双源退化场景，需要手动选择多个预增强步骤，导致误差累积和性能下降

Method: 使用引导频率模态特定提取模块进行频域退化感知和抑制，以及引导空间模态聚合融合模块进行跨模态退化过滤和自适应多源特征聚合

Result: 在双源退化场景下取得了优于现有算法和策略的融合性能

Conclusion: GD^2Fusion框架通过协同集成视觉语言模型和双域联合优化，有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer

and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest

models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with

computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from

ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will

Method: 使用SMPL作为代理表示，将服装到身体的覆盖问题分解为两个对应任务：1）使用基于几何学习的方法处理服装到SMPL的对应；2）使用基于扩散模型的方法处理身体到SMPL的对应，利用多视角一致的外观特征和预训练的2D基础模型。

Result: 系统能够处理复杂几何形状、非流形网格，并有效泛化到广泛的人形角色（包括人类、机器人、卡通角色、生物和外星人），同时保持计算效率。支持服装尺寸和材质的快速定制。

Conclusion: LUIVITON提供了一个完全自动化的服装试穿解决方案，即使在没有2D服装缝制图案的情况下也能产生高质量的3D服装试穿效果，具有实际应用的可行性。

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

TL;DR: ADClick是一个用于工业异常检测的交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注，显著提升异常检测模型性能。ADClick-Seg通过跨模态框架整合视觉特征和文本提示，在多项指标上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业产品检测通常只使用正常样本训练异常检测模型，虽然有缺陷样本但需要像素级标注，限制了可扩展性。需要一种更高效的标注方法来利用缺陷样本。

Method: 提出ADClick交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注。进一步开发ADClick-Seg跨模态框架，通过基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示，结合像素级先验和语言引导线索。

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%。ADClick-Seg在多类异常检测任务上取得最佳结果：AP=80.0%，PRO=97.5%，Pixel-AUROC=99.1%。

Conclusion: ADClick系列方法通过交互式标注和跨模态融合，实现了高效准确的工业异常检测标注和检测性能，解决了传统方法标注成本高的问题。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

TL;DR: GeoSplat是一个几何约束优化框架，利用一阶和二阶几何量改进高斯溅射的整个训练流程，包括初始化、梯度更新和致密化，通过曲率初始化高斯尺度和鲁棒的几何估计方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感的方法估计不可靠。需要更全面的几何约束和鲁棒的估计方法来改进高斯溅射的优化过程。

Method: 提出GeoSplat框架：1）基于主曲率初始化3D高斯原语尺度；2）引入高效且噪声鲁棒的几何估计方法；3）利用局部流形等几何结构提供动态几何先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上的新颖视图合成实验中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯溅射的性能，并超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: GeoSplat通过综合利用一阶和二阶几何量以及鲁棒的估计方法，为高斯溅射提供了有效的几何约束优化框架，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

TL;DR: 通过结合CNN特征提取能力和Transformer关系建模能力的混合深度学习模型SIT，显式建模多尺度视觉线索之间的相互作用，在面部美学预测任务中创造了新的最高水准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在固定尺度处理信息，容易忽略不同细度级别特征之间的关联性，而面部美孩感知需要考虑局部和全局特征的复杂相互作用。

Method: 提出尺度交互Transformer(SIT)混合模型：首先使用并行卷积的多尺度模块捐取不同感受野范围的面部特征，然后将多尺度表征构造为序列，通过Transformer编码器的自注意力机制显式建模它们之间的上下文关系。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500标准数据集上达到新的state-of-the-art，获得皮尔逊相关系数0.9187，超过了之前的所有方法。

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索之间的相互作用对高性能面部美孩预测至关重要，SIT模型成功为复杂图像回归任务提供了一种需要整体性、上下文感知的混合CNN-Transformer解决方案。

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

TL;DR: 使用稀疏混合专家(MoE)层替代CNN中的残差块或卷积层，在不增加推理成本的情况下提升模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，特别是在结合对抗训练时效果显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络(CNNs)对抗攻击的鲁棒性仍然具有挑战性，通常需要资源密集型的对抗措施。探索通过稀疏混合专家层来提高鲁棒性

Method: 在ResNet架构中插入稀疏MoE层替代选定的残差块或卷积层，使用PGD和AutoPGD攻击进行对抗训练，并分析路由平衡机制的影响

Result: 在CIFAR-100上训练的ResNet中，在深层阶段插入单个MoE层结合对抗训练能持续提升鲁棒性。发现switch loss导致路由集中在少数专家上，反而使这些路径更加鲁棒

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE层能有效提升CNN的对抗鲁棒性，某些专家个体的鲁棒性甚至超过整个门控MoE模型，表明鲁棒子路径通过专业化而出现

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

TL;DR: CRAFT是一种源数据不可用、目标标签稀缺情况下的半监督回归迁移学习方法，在神经科学和医学应用中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中源模型无法泛化到域偏移目标数据的问题，特别是在源数据因隐私或计算成本无法共享、目标标签稀缺的医学场景

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发了CRAFT方法，用于源数据不可用的半监督回归任务，不依赖中间表示对齐

Result: 在两个神经科学数据集上，CRAFT相比微调模型RMSE提升达9%，比四种最先进的源无关域适应模型性能提升超过3%

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的源数据不可用半监督深度回归迁移的高效方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法速度慢，依赖UV映射，且对参考图片的保真度不高，需要一种更高效、高质量的素材生成方法。

Method: 采用Transformer框架，统一三平面表示与深度基于的逆投影损失，通过单次前向传播完成素材生成。

Result: 方法在单张图片素材重建任务中在保真度和感知质量方面超过现有最佳方法，每个形状只需0.2秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展、高质量和可控的3D内容创建提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: SGS-3D是一个训练免费的3D实例分割细化方法，通过"先分割后生长"框架，利用几何基元净化模糊的2D到3D提升掩码，然后生长成完整实例，显著提高了分割精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于2D到3D提升的3D实例分割方法由于语义引导模糊和深度约束不足，在提升过程中会产生累积误差，导致实例级分割精度不高。

Method: 提出"split-then-grow"框架：1）使用几何基元纯化和分割模糊的提升掩码；2）在场景中将掩码生长成完整实例。结合语义和几何信息，引入掩码过滤策略和空间连续性特征利用。

Result: 在ScanNet200、ScanNet++和KITTI-360数据集上的实验表明，SGS-3D显著提高了分割精度和鲁棒性，对预训练模型的不准确掩码具有强鲁棒性，在室内外环境中都保持了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SGS-3D通过联合融合语义和几何信息，有效解决了2D到3D提升中的模糊性问题，实现了高保真度的3D实例分割，且无需训练即可作为细化方法使用。

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Conclusion: 该自监督学习框架有效解决了手语识别中对比学习的关键问题，通过学习更有区分性的特征表示，在手语识别任务上取得了显著性能提升，展现了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大语言模型在符号图形编程任务中的表现，提出了一种基于强化学习和可验证奖励的方法来改善SVG生成质量和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在程序综合方面表现优异，但其在生成能够渲染准确视觉内容的符号图形程序方面的能力仍然未充分探索。符号图形编程任务可以作为一个视角来了解LLMs如何理解视觉世界。

Method: 首先构建了SGP-GenBench评测标准，包括对象保真性、场景保真性和组合性。提出了基于强化学习的方法，通过格式有效性检查确保SVG可渲染，并使用SigLIP和DINO等视觉编码器来实现文本与渲染图像的跨模态对齐奖励。

Result: 在SGP-GenBench上，发现前沿专有模型显著超过开源模型，且性能与通用编码能力相关。应用提出的RL方法后，Qwen-2.5-7B模型在SVG生成质量和语义方面显著提升，达到了与前沿系统相当的性能。

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态基础提供了一个精确且可解释的视角。RL训练能够促进对象更细细的分解为可控制的原语，并添加上下文细节来改善场景一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is

COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual

rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain

Conclusion: WinT3R通过创新的滑动窗口和相机表示设计，成功实现了高质量实时三维重建，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online
prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous
methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time
performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism
that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,
thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large
computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and
maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在图表理解中主要依赖识别而非推理，导致在无标注图表上出现严重幻觉和性能下降，需要开发真正的视觉推理能力。

Method: 提出ChartReasoner方法，通过模拟人类行为，将估计基于图表理解来进行视觉推理。

Result: ChartReasoner-3B/7B在CRBench基准测试中取得优异性能，超越GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash，在公开基准测试中也展现出显著的视觉推理能力提升。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner能够引导MLLMs进行合理的图表理解，解决了现有模型主要依赖识别而非推理的问题，显著提升了图表理解的性能。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them
exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when
handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really
understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and
estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a
comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the
visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that
MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret
the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose
ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart
understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that
ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even
compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also
demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on
public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs
to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly
available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生物医学NLP任务中表现良好，但在将本体术语链接到正确标识符时经常失败，需要探究失败原因

Method: 分析两个主要本体（人类表型本体和基因本体）和两个高性能模型（GPT-4o和LLaMa 3.1 405B）的预测结果，评估9个与术语熟悉度、标识符使用、形态学和本体结构相关的特征，进行单变量和多变量分析

Result: 暴露于本体标识符是链接成功的最强预测因子

Conclusion: 模型成功链接本体术语的关键因素是对标识符的熟悉程度，而非术语本身的其他特征

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail
to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these
failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human
Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o
and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term
familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate
and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the
strongest predictor of linking success.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)计算需求大与部署困难的问题，同时保持高性能

Method: 使用不确定性驱动的级联机制：轻量模型作为快速过滤器，高不确定性样本才交由MLLM处理；引入加权平均和基于提示的交叉验证处理模糊预测

Result: 在基准数据集上达到最先进性能，仅需独立使用MLLM的一小部分计算资源

Conclusion: U-ACS系统有效解决了性能与效率的权衡问题，为多模态模型的现实部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly
advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their
substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world
deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but
often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency
trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS)
that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a
lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our
system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small
model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples
yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty,
are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis.
Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or
conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of
similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting
predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This
sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of
computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining
the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to
using a standalone MLLM.

Conclusion: 该研究为评估大语言模型在同行审查中的使用提供了实践基础，有助于发展更精确、公平和可靠的检测方法，以适应实际学术应用需求。

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review
process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly
evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language
refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive
review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to
paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language
refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily
rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result
in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language
enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based
detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark
built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six
distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an
AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve
more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our
work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer
review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and
reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and
data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法预测MBTI人格类型存在局限性，大语言模型在理解人格特质方面展现潜力，但面临幻觉问题和MBTI类型自然分布不平衡两大挑战。

Method: 提出PostToPersonality框架：1）利用检索增强生成和上下文学习缓解LLM幻觉；2）通过合成少数类过采样技术平衡类别分布，并对预训练LLM进行微调。

Result: 在真实社交媒体数据集上的实验表明，PtoP相比10个机器学习和深度学习基线方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PtoP框架有效解决了LLM在MBTI预测中的幻觉和类别不平衡问题，为社交媒体人格预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that
implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally
predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently,
the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential
in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content.
However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges:
the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced
distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose
PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from
social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in
LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification
in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the
class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a
real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art
performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

TL;DR: GPT-5在生物医学NLP基准测试中表现最佳，在问答任务上超越监督SOTA，但在实体识别和摘要任务上仍落后于领域专用模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献快速增长需要可扩展的NLP解决方案，评估GPT-5和GPT-4o在生物医学领域的性能表现

Method: 使用标准化的BioNLP基准测试，在12个数据集上评估GPT-5和GPT-4o的零样本、单样本和五样本提示性能，涵盖6个任务家族

Result: GPT-5在五样本提示下获得0.557的宏平均分，优于GPT-4(0.506)和GPT-4o(0.508)。在MedQA上达到94.1%准确率，超越之前监督SOTA 50多个点

Conclusion: GPT-5在推理导向的生物医学问答任务上达到部署就绪性能，但精确性要求高的抽取任务和证据密集的摘要任务仍需微调或混合方法

Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for
scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially
narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering,
its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized
BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot
prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity
recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question
answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt
templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report
primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and
LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark
performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot
prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached
94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over
fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).
In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and
ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though
summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.
These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering
deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while
precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to
favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple
prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds
are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as
frontier models advance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种通过分析LLM多个生成响应之间的分歧模式来诊断不确定性来源的方法，使用辅助LLM来识别不确定性是源于输入歧义、知识缺乏还是两者皆有。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得突破性进展，但仍会产生不可靠或误导性输出，当前研究主要关注量化模型不确定性，而较少关注诊断不确定性的具体来源。

Method: 收集目标LLM的多个响应，使用辅助LLM分析这些响应的分歧模式，辅助模型需要推理不确定性的可能来源（输入歧义、知识缺乏等），并在知识缺乏情况下识别具体的缺失事实或概念。

Result: 在AmbigQA、OpenBookQA和MMLU-Pro数据集上验证了该框架的有效性，证实了其在诊断不同不确定性来源方面的通用性。

Conclusion: 这种不确定性诊断方法显示了通过相关人工干预来提高LLM性能和可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across
diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing
critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies
focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted
to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,
when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple
generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of
uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a
target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of
disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source
of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,
a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the
auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts
contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework
on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing
distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant
manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

Motivation: 探索自动文本情感识别技术是否能够洞察情感表达在争端解决中对对方思想、情感和行动的影响，特别是在争议性更强的争端情境中。

Method: 使用大型买家-卖家争议对话语料库，分析情感表达如何影响主观和客观结果，并比较大语言模型与传统情感标注方法的性能。

Result: 大语言模型在情感强度标注方面比先前方法具有显著更强的解释力，更符合人类标注者的决策，支持现有关于情感表达如何导致冲突升级和解决的理论模型。

Conclusion: 基于代理的系统可以通过识别和缓解情感升级来有效管理争端，自动情感识别技术在这方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts'
thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text
emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of
dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in
negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social
processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to
investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes.
We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater
explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and
better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing
theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict
escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful
in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional
escalation.

Conclusion: 语言模型通过时间和语义双重局部性的即时计算过程来适应新证据和即时学习新任务。

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their
in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and
perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate
\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and
\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on
''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can
restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full
prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic
ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task
categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often
condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which
align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the
context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the
sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task
identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local
but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',
such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more
temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.
This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of
just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt
to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

Conclusion: 该方法为大语言模型的高效部署提供了一种有效的剪枝解决方案，特别是在预填解码分离场景下显示出显著的性能优势

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and
memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these
demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of
prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a
novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and
efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and
distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the
prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we
introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in
the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token
sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD
unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method
achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data
transmission bandwidth consumption.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant
opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in
specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice
questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous
professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis
complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities:
multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly
accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.
  We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum
content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval
through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation,
significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial
certification evaluation.
  Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others
in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements
particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies
knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text
readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in
finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and
cost-performance optimization.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂指令跟随、减少幻觉和空间推理任务中的局限性，提升模型在协作构建等任务中的表现。

Method: 集成中等规模LLM代理，采用新颖的抽象机制和话语模块来解析指令，在上下文中学习环境的动态高层次表示。

Result: 在自然协作构建任务中表现优于使用更大LLM的单LLM CoT和代理LLM系统，能够大幅避免幻觉、识别缺失信息、请求澄清并更新学习对象。在ToolBench API完成任务中也展示了超越环境的抽象能力。

Conclusion: COCORELI框架通过混合代理方法和抽象机制，有效提升了LLM在复杂任务中的性能，特别是在减少幻觉和空间推理方面表现出色，其抽象能力具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the

complex instructions, minimizing hallucination, and spatial reasoning. COCORELI
integrates medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a
discourse module to parse instructions to in-context learn dynamic, high-level
representations of the environment. Experiments on natural collaborative
construction tasks show that COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic
LLM systems, all using larger LLMs. It manages to largely avoid hallucinations,
identify missing information, ask for clarifications, and update its learned
objects. COCORELI's abstraction abilities extend beyond ENVIRONMENT, as shown
in the ToolBench API completion task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个多语言、分类法无关的计算高效放射报告分类方法，基于开源语言模型MedGemma-4B，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量微调，在多种语言和影像模态上达到接近专家水平的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射报告分析方法存在局限性：基于规则的方法难以处理语言变异性，监督模型需要大量标注数据，基于LLM的系统依赖闭源或资源密集型模型，且当前解决方案主要限于英语和单模态单分类法数据集。

Method: 基于紧凑的开源语言模型MedGemma-4B构建，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量微调，可在消费级GPU上部署，使用数据增强技术。

Result: 在7个英语、西班牙语、法语和丹麦语数据集上评估，在5个胸部X光数据集上平均宏观F1分数达到88，接近或超过专家水平，仅需24GB GPU内存。数据增强后，仅需80个标注样本即可在丹麦语报告上达到82的加权F1分数。

Conclusion: MOSAIC为临床环境提供了大型或专有LLM的实用替代方案，代码和模型开源，邀请社区评估和扩展到新语言、分类法和模态。

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train
imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing
approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with
linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and
recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models
that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely
restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We
introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally
efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact
open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot
prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade
GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and
Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model
achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets,
approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB
of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are
sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86
with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative
to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are
open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new
languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

TL;DR: RECAP是一个新的基准测试，用于评估和改进意图重写技术，通过将模糊对话重写为清晰的目标表示来提升多智能体对话系统的规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界对话往往存在模糊性、不完整性和动态变化，传统分类方法在开放域设置中泛化能力差，导致意图检测困难和下游规划效果不佳。

Method: 提出RECAP基准数据集和基于LLM的评估器，开发基于提示的重写方法，并微调两个基于DPO的重写模型。

Result: 基于提示的重写方法优于基线，DPO微调进一步提升了效用增益，证明了意图重写对改善智能体规划的有效性。

Conclusion: 意图重写是提升开放域对话系统中智能体规划能力的关键且可行的技术组件。

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in
conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models
(LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often
ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent
challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize
in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream
planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new
benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing
user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures
diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal
conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that
assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a
prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further
demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility
gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable
component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

Conclusion: 该方法通过参数高效的适配器和LLM合成数据标注，有效解决了语音-LLM集成的数据和资源限制问题，并在多个语音理解任务上取得了显著成效

Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and
resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To
address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that
converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and
sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based
synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer
trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative
Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative
F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA
task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier
regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields
notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE)
score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了首个综合性测试时缩放加速指标准，评估了三种推理解码方法在加速大语言模型测试时缩放中的效果，发现n-gram基方法在处理重复逻辑方面有独特优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放模式存在计算效率低下的问题，产生了冗余和重复的逻辑迹迹，导致显著的计算开销。虽然推理解码提供了减少这种无效性的有前景方法，但其在结构化、重复丰富的测试时缩放环境中的效果仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究建立了一个综合性指标准，在代表性的测试时缩放范式（如Best-of-N采样和多轮思考）上提供了一致的实验协议，对三种主要推理解码方法进行了公平比较：模型基、训练基和n-gram基方法。

Result: 大量实验表明，简单的n-gram基方法能够有效捐捕重复模式，在加速测试时缩放方面展现出独特的潜力。这种现象证明了将n-gram基方法与模型基或训练基方法相结合的价值，以在测试时缩放中平衡重复逻辑和多样化逻辑的加速效果。

Conclusion: 这个指标准希望能够促进更多关于推理解码在测试时缩放中的研究，通过更好地处理重复和多样化的逻辑路径，实现更快速和更实用的大语言模型推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional
computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently
inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces,
leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a
promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the
structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM
test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols
across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and
multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of
speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.
Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively
capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating
test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating
n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance
acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We
hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for
test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through
better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

TL;DR: ParaThinker通过并行思维方法解决LLM推理中的隧道视觉问题，相比顺序推理在相同计算量下获得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的顺序推理策略存在隧道视觉问题，初始不完美的推理步骤会将模型锁定在次优路径上，导致计算量增加但性能提升有限

Method: 提出ParaThinker框架，训练LLM并行生成多个不同的推理路径，然后综合这些路径得出更优的最终答案

Result: 在挑战性推理基准测试中，ParaThinker相比顺序LLM实现显著准确率提升（1.5B模型平均提升12.3%，7B模型平均提升7.5%），仅增加7.1%的延迟开销

Conclusion: 并行计算扩展（宽度）比顺序计算扩展（深度）是更有效和高效的推理扩展方式，使小模型能够超越更大模型，为未来LLM扩展确立了关键维度

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time
compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,
sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a
significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation
offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an
inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy
itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial
steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce
a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an
end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning
paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By
exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively
sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning
potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)
is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling
sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves
substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%
for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible
latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger
counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient
dimension for scaling future LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到分子模型使用原子级标记化，主要关注局部连接性，但难以捕捉分子的全局结构上下文（如环系统等子结构级信息），这限制了模型对分子语义的理解能力。

Method: 提出子结构级标记化方案，并开发基于重要性的训练策略，优先处理关键子结构。还提出了简单有效的集成策略来聚合多个模型的输出。

Result: CAMT5在各种文本到分子生成任务中表现出优越性，仅使用2%的训练标记就能超越最先进方法。集成策略进一步提升了生成性能。

Conclusion: 子结构级标记化和基于重要性的训练策略能有效提升文本到分子模型对分子语义的捕捉能力，CAMT5在效率和性能方面都有显著优势。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various
chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models
to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However,
they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local
connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global
structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by
the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule
structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization
for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an
importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling
CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify
the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.
Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using
only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to
further boost the generation performance. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers
culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource
environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system
is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that
provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven
behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an
automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a
sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to
ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine
learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety
issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent
connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers
demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected
unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying
data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在稀有词符预测方面存在困难，先前研究发现存在专门的plateau神经元处理稀有词符，但其功能组织机制尚不清楚

Method: 在GPT-2 XL和Pythia模型中进行神经元影响分析、基于图的聚类分析和注意力头消融实验

Result: 1) 稀有词符处理需要额外的plateau神经元；2) plateau神经元呈空间分布式而非模块化集群；3) 注意力机制没有对专家神经元的偏好性路由

Conclusion: 稀有词符专业化是通过训练驱动的分布式分化而非架构模块化实现的，既保持了上下文敏感灵活性又实现了自适应容量分配

Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms
driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized
``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime
influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is
unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based
clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our
findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau
neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual
computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather
than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no
preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token
specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation
rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility
while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its
wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design.
Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further
broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on
large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to
favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their
performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and
real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address
this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by
the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each
individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from
the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of
accurate personalized VER.

Method: 使用能量基模型(EBM)在2.6M指南问题语义语料上学习平滑能量场景，与softmax基线和kNN密度假设进行对比

Result: EBM在语义难题上表现最优(AUROC 0.961 vs 0.950)，低FPR@95(0.235 vs 0.331)，在安全关键场景下优势明显

Conclusion: 能量基避克评分比概率基的softmax更可靠，为安全RAG系统提供了可扩展和可解释的基础

Abstract: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where
incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that
learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M
guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or
abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard
abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging
near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance
abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for
softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives,
performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most
pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with
controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems
primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of
specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is
not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that
energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than
probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable
foundation for safe RAG systems.

Result: 通过自动评估为声明分解建立了基准，提高了事实核查系统的可靠性和有效性

Conclusion: DecMetrics为声明分解质量评估提供了有效的自动评估框架，推动了事实核查系统的发展

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by
breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying
their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily
focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on
evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap,
we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics:
\texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY},
designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by
decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim
decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of
these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach
aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability
and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer
review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews,
automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus
making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify
four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of
reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &
Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and
development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil
dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with
10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data
additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a
review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models
for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our
experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels
with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful
closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated
reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

*Chris Sainsbury,Andreas Karwath*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASCENDgpt是一个基于Transformer的心血管风险预测模型，通过创新的表型感知标记化方案将47,155个原始ICD代码映射到176个临床有意义的表型标记，在保持语义信息的同时显著减少词汇量，实现了优秀的心血管事件预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)中包含大量ICD诊断代码，直接使用原始代码会导致词汇量过大和计算效率低下。需要开发一种能够将原始医疗代码映射到临床有意义的表型标记的方法，以提高心血管风险预测的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出表型感知标记化方案，将47,155个原始ICD代码映射到176个临床表型标记；使用掩码语言建模目标在19,402个个体数据上进行预训练；针对五种心血管结局进行时间到事件预测的微调。

Result: 模型在测试集上表现出色，平均C-index为0.816，各结局预测性能：心肌梗死0.792、卒中0.824、主要不良心血管事件0.800、心血管死亡0.842、全因死亡率0.824。词汇量减少77.9%，诊断代码压缩率达99.6%。

Conclusion: 表型基于的方法实现了临床可解释的预测同时保持计算效率，证明了领域特定标记化和预训练在EHR基于风险预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for
cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records
(EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme
that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens,
achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic
information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442
tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We
pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a
masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction
of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set
with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all
outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842,
all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically
interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining
for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

*Hao Shi,Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Lianbo Liu,Atsushi Kojima,Yui Sudo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种序列化输出提示(SOP)方法，通过结构化提示显式指导LLM，显著提升多说话人语音识别系统在复杂场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多说话人ASR系统要么忽略提示词，要么依赖简单的任务定义提示，缺乏通过提示设计来提升性能的研究。

Method: 提出SOP-MT-ASR方法：在语音编码器后插入分离器和序列化CTC层来分离多说话人内容，通过贪心搜索解码获得SOP提示，并采用三阶段训练策略。

Result: 在LibriMix数据集上的实验表明，SOP方法在双说话人和三说话人场景下均显著提升了性能，特别是在复杂的三说话人场景中效果明显。

Conclusion: 序列化输出提示方法能有效指导LLM，提升多说话人ASR系统在复杂条件下的性能，为解决多说话人语音识别问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of
large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based
multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit
prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring
the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose
extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using
structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and
serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted
after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed
speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,
which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC
outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a
three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)
fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based
adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although
the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to
fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker
scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under
both two- and three-talker conditions.

*Xinnian Zhao,Hugo Van Hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用电视字幕作为上下文提示的弱监督语音识别方法，通过迭代优化生成伪转录本，显著提高了转录准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电视字幕虽然容易获取，但由于与音频对齐不精确，不能直接作为监督信号。需要一种方法来处理口语音频和字幕文本之间的差异

Method: 将字幕重新构想为上下文丰富的提示，生成伪转录本作为主要目标，字幕作为迭代优化的引导线索。引入加权注意力机制在推理时强调相关字幕标记

Result: 实验证明转录准确性显著提升，生成的伪标签数据集为训练鲁棒ASR系统提供了高质量基础资源

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了电视字幕的上下文信息，通过弱监督框架成功解决了字幕与音频不对齐的问题，为ASR系统训练提供了更好的数据资源

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly
supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV
subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding
audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim
transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our
method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model
to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead,
generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting
as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we
introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle
tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide
high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种一次投影幻觉检测方法，利用黑盒LLM API中可获取的前几个词比彩对数来提升问答任务的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在问答任务中的幻觉问题，特别是在数据访问受限的黑盒API场景下。

Method: 从非贪婪解码过程中提取前几个词比彩对数，建立熵测率生成率(EPR)指标，并通过监督学习进一步优化。

Result: 在多个QA数据集和LLM上验证，该方法显著提升了幻觉检测性能，仅需前10个词比彩对数即可实现高性能。

Conclusion: 该技术为限制环境下的LLM应用提供了实用的幻觉检测方案，特别适用于金融领域的RAG系统。

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering
(QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper
introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,
specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as
interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top
candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty
indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated
during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR)
metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised
learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic
contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated
sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA
datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination
detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated
using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top
<10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these
API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique
to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass
in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility
further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on
annual reports from an industrial dataset.

TL;DR: 基于MIMIC-IV数据库的10,000份ICU出院摘要，通过混合流水线分析临床笔记中的情感嵌入、词汇压力识别和主题模型，成功预测医护人员燃尽风险，精度达0.80，F1分数0.84。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生燃尽尤其在ICU环境中对患者安全构成威胁，现有研究主要依赖回顾性问卷或广泛的EHR元数据，忽视了临床笔记中含有价值的叙事信息。

Method: 采用混合流水线：细调BioBERT情感嵌入、专门设计的词汇压力识别库、5主题LDA模型以及工作负荷代理指标，通过提供者级别逻辑回归分类器进行分析。

Result: 在分层预留集上达到精度0.80、召回0.89、F1分数0.84的性能，超过仅使用元数据的基准方法至少0.17个F1分数。根据专业分析，放射科、精神病学和神经科的提供者燃尽风险较高。

Conclusion: ICU临床笔记中含有可执行的信号，可用于主动的健康状况监测，为预防医护人员燃尽提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly
in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly
relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR)
metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in
clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from
MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health
records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses
diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses,
procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce
a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for
clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout
surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload
proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision
of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out
set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1
score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among
providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate
that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive
well-being monitoring.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验研究发现大语言模型在大学和专业推荐中存在显著的地理、人口统计和经济偏见，建议采用多维度评估框架来确保教育推荐的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被越来越多地用于教育规划等日常推荐任务，它们的推荐存在扩大社会偏见的风险，需要实证研究这些偏见并确保高等教育的公平访问。

Method: 使用360个根据性别、国籍和经济状况变化的模拟用户资料，对三个开源LLM（LLaMA-3.1-8B、Gemma-7B和Mistral-7B）进行超过25,000次推荐分析，提出了一个新的多维度评估框架来量化人口统计和地理表现问题。

Result: 结果显示存在显著偏见：北半球机构被不成比优先推荐，推荐常常强化性别定型，机构重复现象普遍。虽然LLaMA-3.1在58个国家推荐了481所唯一大学实现最高多样性，但系统性差异仍然存在。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了在教育大语言模型中考虑偏见问题的紧迫性，建议采用多维度评估框架来保证高等教育推荐的公平性和全球可访问性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation
systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk
perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic,
demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from
three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360
simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we
analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions
in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often
reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While
LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities
across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we
propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond
accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure
equitable global access to higher education.

TL;DR: DeepTRACE是一个新颖的社会技术审计框架，用于评估生成式搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理在答案文本、来源和引用方面的表现，发现这些系统经常产生片面、过度自信且引用不准确的回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理在可信度、来源基础和引用实践方面存在过度自信、弱来源支持和混乱引用等问题，需要系统化的评估框架。

Method: 开发DeepTRACE框架，包含8个可测量维度，使用语句级分析（分解、置信度评分）和构建引用与事实支持矩阵，通过自动化提取流程和LLM-judge评估多个主流模型。

Result: 生成式搜索引擎和深度研究代理在辩论查询中经常产生片面且高度自信的回答，包含大量无来源支持的陈述。深度研究配置能减少过度自信并提高引用完整性，但在辩论查询中仍显片面，引用准确率在40-80%之间。

Conclusion: 现有系统在证据推理和归因方面存在显著缺陷，需要改进引用准确性和平衡性，DeepTRACE框架为系统评估和改进提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy,
source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak
sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel
sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified
failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources,
and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition,
confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit
how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated
extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,
Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to
human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research
configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep
research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on
debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their
own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can
attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate
queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with
citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

TL;DR: LLMs在处理混合上下文时存在脆弱性，倾向于采纳较少出现的信息，即使是不相关内容。研究提出Poisoned Context测试平台和基于Rescorla-Wagner模型的RW-Steering方法，通过微调使模型能够识别并忽略不适当内容，提升响应质量39.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界上下文往往混合相关和不相关内容，LLMs在处理这种混合上下文时存在可靠性风险，需要研究其处理机制并提出解决方案。

Method: 引入Poisoned Context测试平台，将Rescorla-Wagner模型从神经科学适配到LLM行为量化；提出RW-Steering两阶段微调方法，使模型内部识别和忽略不适当信号。

Result: 发现LLMs倾向于采纳较少出现的上下文信息；RW-Steering方法在实验中提升响应质量39.8%，能够泛化处理不同比例的不相关内容。

Conclusion: RW-Steering是一种鲁棒、可泛化的上下文工程解决方案，能够有效提高LLM在现实世界使用中的安全性。

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Conclusion: 该工作为指令微调领域提供了一个系统化的学习资源，通过简化的表达方式大大提升了算法的可访问性，并为未来研究开启了新的思路。

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key
algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling,
REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume
prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and
complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using
simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity
and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing
detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we
eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following
this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and
approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and
exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy

Conclusion: VaccineRAG能够系统性地暴露当前LLMs的固有弱点，并通过思维链分析和Partial-GRPO方法显著提升模型在检索增强生成任务中的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with
external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and
Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is
frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples
fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical
bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce
VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation
dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using
data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing
inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models'
sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT
content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple
components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed
preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to
learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be
publicly released soon.

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试主要关注性能指标，无法捕捉模型间的细微行为差异，需要新的评估框架来深入理解模型的行为特征。

Method: 使用诊断提示套件和自动化评估流程，让强大的LLM作为公正评判者，分析18个不同能力层级的模型。

Result: 发现顶级模型在抽象推理和因果推理等核心能力上趋同，但在奉承性和语义鲁棒性等对齐相关行为上差异显著，并观察到跨模型的默认人格聚类（ISTJ/ESTJ）。

Conclusion: 模型的交互特性并非其规模或推理能力的涌现属性，而是特定且高度可变的开发者对齐策略的直接结果，该框架为揭示这些深层行为差异提供了可复现和可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on
performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral
characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel
``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional
evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive
and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an
innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an
impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our
results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core
capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top
models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness
vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering
(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,
this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of
its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly
variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible
and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to
generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant
progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work
has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,
which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these
challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that
combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)
for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the
LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative
and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,
demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech
interfaces.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable
alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for
addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives
compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off,
we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the
AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language
models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,
SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we
introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new
sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel
strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently
improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto
analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better
effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows
the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce
subtask error rates.

Motivation: 探索VR和AI技术在读写困难症识别中的应用潜力，开发新的辅助评估工具。

Method: 让参与者完成VR基于默读测试和自尊心评估，先进行统计分析，然后使用监督学习算法训练分类模型。

Result: 默读完成时间呈现显著差异，模型在意大利达到87.5%准确率，西班牙为66.6%，汇总组为75%，语言因素影响分类效果。

Conclusion: VR和机器学习可作为读写困难症评估的有效辅助工具，特别是通过任务完成速度来区分，但需考虑语言特异性。

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish
university students. In particular, the research investigates whether
VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can
differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that
are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed
VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary
statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was
performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without
dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,
but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were
trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence
of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for
Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR
and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia,
particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but
language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

*Edoardo Pinzuti,Oliver Tüscher,André Ferreira Castro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型在情感敏感内容处理上的扩展行为，发现大模型在零样本和多标签分类中表现更好，但轻量微调后的小模型也能达到相近性能，适合隐私敏感应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何处理情感敏感内容对于构建安全可靠的系统（特别是在心理健康领域）至关重要，需要研究不同规模模型在情感安全分类任务上的表现。

Method: 构建包含15K+样本的新数据集，评估四个LLaMA模型（1B、3B、8B、70B）在零样本、少样本和微调设置下的性能，包括三元情感安全分类和多标签安全风险分类。

Result: 大模型平均表现更好，特别是在零样本和多标签分类中。但经过轻量微调的1B模型在多个高数据类别中能达到与大模型和BERT相当的性能，且推理时仅需<2GB显存。

Conclusion: 小型设备端模型可以作为隐私保护的可行替代方案，具有解释情感语境和维持安全对话边界的能力，对治疗性LLM应用和安全关键系统的可扩展对齐具有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive
content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in
mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key
tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs.
borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk
taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several
human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with
emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA
models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.
Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance,
particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings.
However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance
comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while
requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller,
on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for
sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and
maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications
for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical
systems.

*Osman Batur İnce,André F. T. Martins,Oisin Mac Aodha,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SEMI方法，通过超网络实现样本高效的多模态集成，仅需少量样本即可将新模态集成到LLM中，显著提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态基础模型需要处理不断演变的多种模态，但从头训练不现实，且现有方法需要大量配对数据，而低资源模态往往缺乏这样的数据。

Method: 设计超网络来适应共享投影器，该投影器位于模态特定编码器和LLM之间。超网络在高资源模态上训练，在推理时根据任意模态的少量样本生成适配器。通过等距变换增加训练模态多样性。

Result: SEMI在新模态（卫星图像、天文图像、惯性测量、分子）的少样本集成中显著提升样本效率，32-shot SEMI达到的准确率需要64倍更多数据才能通过从头训练投影器实现。

Conclusion: SEMI有望扩展基础模型的模态覆盖范围，为低资源模态的集成提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since
the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a
model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,
integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires
a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for
low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for
sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).
To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --
placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The
hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,
video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at
inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of
training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through
isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in
sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,
satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)
with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the
same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs
64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality
coverage of foundation models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出BAME方法，通过模型生成的解释来指导提示工程，有效减少AI生成职业故事中的性别和种族偏见，在不修改模型参数的情况下将人口统计代表性提高了2%-20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在输出中传播社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族表征方面。本研究旨在调查AI生成职业故事中的性别和种族偏见，并提出有效的缓解策略。

Method: 提出BAME（Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation）方法，利用模型生成的解释来指导有针对性的提示工程，分析25个职业群体、3个大型语言模型（Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Llama 3.1 70B Instruct和GPT-4 Turbo）以及多个人口统计维度生成的故事。

Result: 应用BAME后，人口统计代表性改善了2%-20%，识别出与训练数据刻板印象相关的过度代表和不足代表的持续模式。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型使用其内部推理机制可以显著提高人口统计平等性，有助于开发更透明的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their
output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper
investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories.
Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed
mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME),
revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%.
BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt
engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By
analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language
models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and
multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of
overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.
Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning
mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing
to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

*Sophie Jaffer,Simeon Sayer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对比博茫语和英语BERT模型的性能，证实了多语言语言模型在非英语语言上的表现差异，说明翻译不能完全消除语言表征差异，本土语言训练对于可靠结果仍至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到大语言模型多语言能力的扩展，需要考察其在不同语言上的表现公平性。英语在训练数据中的主导地位可能会使非英语语者处于不利地位，本研究通过实验验证这种数据差异是否会影响模型性能。

Method: 研究比较了两个单语言BERT模型：一个全部在斯瓦希里语数据上训练和测试，另一个在相似的英语新闻数据上训练。为了模拟多语言模型通过内部翻译和抽象处理非英语查询的方式，研究将斯瓦希里语新闻数据翻译成英语，并使用英语训练模型进行评估。

Result: 结果显示，尽管翻译质量高，本土斯瓦希里语训练的模型表现优于斯瓦希里语-英语翻译模型，错误率相差近四倍：0.36% vs 1.47%。这一差距表明翻译单独无法清除语言间的表征差异。

Conclusion: 研究证实了多语言模型在非英语语言上的表现差异，翻译不能完全消除语言表征差异。在教育和信息背景下，即使小的性能差距也可能加剧不平等。未来研究应重点关注低代表性语言的数据集开发和多语言模型评估，以减少全球AI部署对现有数字沟的加剧效应。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions
remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many
communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in
training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis
that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares
two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,
and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs
process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we
translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the
English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether
translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or
worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,
thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual
abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the
native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English
translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%
respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge
representational differences between languages and that models trained in one
language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to
imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language
training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and
informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.
Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for
underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model
evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing
digital divides is reduced.

TL;DR: 通过语音式归纳偏置（参数解耦和半监督学习）改善向量量化自动编码器在手语识别中的性能，特别是对未见手势的一次性重构和识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语数据集常常误差大且词汇不充分，需要模型能够向未见手势扩展。向量量化是一种有前景的方法，但需要确认学习到的单元是否捕获了偏差相关而影响性能。

Method: 探索了两种语音学归纳偏置：参数解耦（结构偏置）和语音半监督（正则化技术），通过向量量化自动编码器来改善已知手势的隔离识别和未见手势的重构质量。

Result: 与对照基线相比，所提出模型学习到的表征在未见手势的一次性重构和手语识别方面更有效，更具区分性。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了定量分析，证明明确的、语言学动机的偏置能够提高手语学习表征的扩展性能。

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary,
underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector
quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like
representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units
capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This
work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement,
an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization
technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and
reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The
primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are
more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more
discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This
work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated
biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign
language.

Method: 使用NRC情感词典和TextBlob识别八种情感类别，对MAUDE数据库2000-2021年患者报告进行情感分析和时间序列分析。

Result: 发现2011-2012和2017-2018期间关注报告数量和情感强度显著增加，反映了患者体验的重要变化。

Conclusion: 情感考量在医疗实践中至关重要，情感分析能够改善本前咨询、本后护理和患者准备工作。

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but
postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes
patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience
(MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of
patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives
into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy,
and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns
in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent
concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in
patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and
technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in
Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012
and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall
sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare
practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences
post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling,
postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The
study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical
practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance
patient care.

Motivation: 大语言模型在工具使用方面表现出色但资源需求大，小语言模型虽然更轻量但在工具使用能力上存在明显短板，需要找到高效的方法来提升SLMs的工具使用能力

Method: 采用强化学习方法，特别是Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)技术，对小型语言模型进行优化训练

Result: 该方法显著提升了小语言模型的工具使用准确率，增强了其实际应用价值

Conclusion: GRPO强化学习方法为提升小语言模型工具使用能力提供了高效有效的解决方案，相比传统微调方法更具适应性和计算效率

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and
tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool
use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs,
databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond
generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations,
making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This
capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve
problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for
applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or
automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource
requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As
a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small
Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use
compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are
typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower
knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning
(RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance
tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that
require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an
efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy,
increasing their practical utility.

Motivation: 当前端到端图像内机器翻译研究主要基于合成数据，存在背景简单、字体单一、文本位置固定等问题，无法充分反映真实世界场景，导致研究与实践之间存在显著差距。

Method: 作者标注了PRIM数据集（包含真实世界拍摄的单行文本图像，具有复杂背景、多样字体和文本位置），并提出了VisTrans模型，该模型分别处理图像中的视觉文本和背景信息，在支持多语言翻译的同时提升视觉质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，VisTrans模型相比其他模型在翻译质量和视觉效果方面都取得了更好的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究通过PRIM数据集和VisTrans模型推动了图像内多语言机器翻译在真实场景中的应用，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts
from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly
conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text
position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world,
causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To
facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical
In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the
lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains
real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various
fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation
directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of
practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background
information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual
translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate
the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared
to other models. The code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical
natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational
requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where
data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this
study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12
state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and
biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key
tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label
classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially
reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance
across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB
consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness
to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide
significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a
practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of
large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the
gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

Result: HSMP-BERT在24个器官-发现组合上平均F1得分0.83±0.08，κ系数0.65±0.17，显著优于基线方法，推理速度提升5.1倍

Conclusion: HSMP-BERT为放射学结构化提取提供了可扩展解决方案，支持克罗恩病的群体水平分析，展示了AI在低资源环境中的潜力

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is
challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in
Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed
Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based
model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database
study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across
Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for
findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90
structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66%
train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was
evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24
organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1
0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot
baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning
(F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$).
Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference.
Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening,
stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in
inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured
extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease
and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 哨利亚长期武装冲突缺乏系统性暴力记录，导致公开冲突信息和历史记载的缺失，需要新方法来建立历史记忆。

Method: 使用GPT大语言模型阅读和分析超过200,000篇西班牙语暴力相关报纸文章，构建数据集进行描述性分析和暴力与古卡植植清除关系研究。

Result: 研究建立了大规模冲突数据集，并通过实例演示了这类数据在政策分析中的应用价值，显示了暴力与古卡植植清除的关联性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型为研究大规模文本语料提供了前所未有的深度分析能力，开启了新的研究机遇，特别是在历史记忆构建和政策分析领域。

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently,
the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian
government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict
information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study
contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language
model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related
newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both
descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the
eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such
data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research
opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously
infeasible depth.

Motivation: 虽然Transformer语言模型在NLP任务中表现优异，但细粒度控制仍靠挑战，需要开发更有效的控制方法。

Method: 通过提示工程、参数效率微调、模型编辑和强化学习来解决可控文本生成的优化问题，提出包含提示层、激活干预和权重空间编辑的统一框架。

Conclusion: 这项工作为设计可控制和健壮的语言模型奠定了基础，同时讨论了伦理双重使用风险和严格评估的必要性。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained
control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating
transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts,
activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an
optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified
framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and
weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including
adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal
weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects.
Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits
while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs
exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation.
This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language
models.

cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based
attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual
understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation
generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these
attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust
countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of
prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat
model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey
aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation
of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation,
fine-tuning, and editing.

*Xiyuan Gao,Shekhar Nayak,Matt Coler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述首次聚焦基于语音的讽刺识别研究，回顾了从单模态到多模态方法的发展历程，涵盖数据集、特征提取和分类方法，指出了跨文化和多语言讽刺识别的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺作为人类交流的常见特征，在人际互动和人机交互中带来挑战。虽然以往研究主要关注基于文本的讽刺检测，但语音数据在识别讽刺方面的作用尚未得到充分探索。利用语音数据进行自动讽刺识别可以增强神经退行性疾病患者的社交互动，并改善机器对复杂人类语言使用的理解。

Method: 采用系统综述方法，分析基于语音的讽刺识别研究的发展轨迹，包括数据集的局限性、特征提取技术从传统声学特征到深度学习表示的演变，以及分类方法从单模态方法到多模态融合技术的进展。

Result: 研究发现讽刺识别语音数据集存在局限性，特征提取技术经历了从传统声学特征到深度学习表示的演变，分类方法也从单模态方法发展到多模态融合技术。

Conclusion: 需要更加重视跨文化和多语言讽刺识别，并将讽刺视为多模态现象而非基于文本的挑战来处理。

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in
interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research
has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch,
speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous
work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in
recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech
technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for
automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding
of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This
systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition,
charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers
datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge
gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in
datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction
techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based
representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal
approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need
for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as
well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather
than a text-based challenge.

*Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh,Afshin Oroojlooyjadid,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于SQL2NL的模式对齐复述框架，用于自动生成语义相同但词汇多样的查询，首次系统评估NL2SQL模型对语言变化的鲁棒性，发现现有模型在复述查询上性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少系统或受控地处理语言变异因素，无法准确评估NL2SQL模型的泛化能力，需要专门针对语言变异进行鲁棒性评估。

Method: 使用SQL-to-NL技术自动生成语义等价但词汇多样的查询，同时保持与原始模式和意图的对齐，创建模式对齐的复述框架。

Result: 最先进模型比标准基准测试显示的更脆弱：LLaMa3.3-70B执行准确率下降10.23%，LLaMa3.1-8B下降近20%，小模型受影响更严重。鲁棒性退化程度因查询复杂度、数据集和领域而异。

Conclusion: 需要显式测量语言泛化能力的评估框架，以确保模型在真实世界环境中的可靠性能，语言变异是影响NL2SQL模型鲁棒性的关键因素。

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to
understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL
(NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a
systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing
framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate
semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment
with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation
of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior
work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than
standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop
in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries,
while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to
42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We
also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query
complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation
frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable
performance in real-world settings.

*Sharif Noor Zisad,Ragib Hasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对比传统机器学习模型和变换器模型，证明了变换器模型在灾难相关推文分类任务中的优勃性能，特别是BERT模型达到了91%的最高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体在灾难和公共安全紧急情况下成为重要的实时信息来源，自动分类灾难相关推文能够帮助紧急服务更快速有效响应。传统机器学习模型缺乏语境理解能力，特别是对不正式、隐喻或模糊的语言。

Method: 评估多种变换器模型（BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTa）在灾难相关推文分类任务中的效果，并与传统机器学习方法（逻辑回归、贝叶斯、支持向量机）进行对比分析。

Result: 实验结果显示BERT模型达到最高准确率91%，显著超过传统模型（逻辑回归和贝叶斯均为82%）。变换器模型通过上下文嵌入和注意力机制能够更好地理解推文中的细微语言特征。

Conclusion: 变换器架构在公共安全应用中更为适合，提供了更高的准确率、更深入的语言理解能力以及在真实世界社交媒体文本上更好的普适性。

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real
time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically
classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster
and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for
this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of
words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We
posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than
traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for
classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional
ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that
BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming
traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The
use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models
to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models
fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far
more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy,
deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world
social media text.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于模型抛弃忍受度的推理时域外检测算法，通过ICAD框架和合成方法提高专业大语言模型的OOD检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业化大语言模型虽在领域内任务上表现优异，但面对域外输入时容易产生错误输出，存在安全风险

Method: 基于归纳遵循异常检测(ICAD)框架，使用模型抛弃忍受度作为新的非遵循性测量，通过合成方法汇总多层抛弃忍受度

Result: 在医疗专业LLMs上进行实验，方法在OOD检测上表现更优于基线方法，AUROC提升从2%到37%

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测专业LLMs的域外输入，保持理论偏报约束的同时提高检测性能

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for
specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain
vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs,
posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive
Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity
measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on
polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs
exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout
tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving
detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD.
Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD
inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$
when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as
negatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出基于MQUAKE框架的多跳问题分解方法，使用LLAMA3模型验证了该方法在知识图谱中提升复杂问题回答准确性的有效性，无论是在训练前还是训练后都显著优于直接回答复杂问题的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在准确回答复杂问题方面一直面临挑战，需要寻找有效方法来提升模型的理解和推理能力。

Method: 使用多跳问题分解方法将复杂问题分解，构建单跳和多跳数据集，基于LLAMA3模型进行微调（使用LoRA方法），并在MQUAKE-T数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 未经微调时，多跳分解方法的预测性能显著优于直接回答方法；微调后两种方法性能都有提升，但多跳分解方法始终保持优势。

Conclusion: 多跳问题分解方法能有效增强LLM回答复杂问题的能力，在训练前后都表现出优越性，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant
challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper
proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions,
building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model,
we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition
within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both
before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically
partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a
single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a
multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition
method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted
inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the
prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method
significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions.
After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance
of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the
method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its
superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop
decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its
capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex
questions.

TL;DR: 首个针对阿拉伯语和大语言模型在阿拉伯语生成任务中的幻觉评估研究，涵盖12个模型，发现事实幻觉比忠实性错误更普遍，阿拉伯语预训练模型表现优于多语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型幻觉研究主要集中于英语，阿拉伯语作为全球重要语言却缺乏系统性评估，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 开发了包含12个细粒度幻觉指标的评估框架，在生成式问答和摘要两个关键任务上评估了4个阿拉伯语预训练模型、4个多语言模型和4个推理模型的幻觉表现。

Result: 事实幻觉在所有模型和任务中比忠实性错误更普遍；阿拉伯语预训练模型Allam的幻觉率低于多语言模型，与推理模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语特定模型在减少幻觉方面表现更好，需要针对阿拉伯语特点开发更有效的幻觉检测和缓解方法。

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language
models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing
number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination
in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is
particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its
importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first
comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two
critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question
answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,
including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4
reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of
LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework
consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the
varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual
hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models
and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently
demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a
comparative performance with reasoning-based models. The code is available at:

*Adam Tauman Kalai,Ofir Nachum,Santosh S. Vempala,Edwin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型产生幻觉是因为训练和评估过程奖励猜测而非承认不确定性，这源于二元分类错误和测试优化策略，需要通过修改评分标准来解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在不确定时猜测而非承认不确定性产生的幻觉问题，这种问题即使在最先进系统中仍然存在并破坏信任。

Method: 分析现代训练流程中幻觉的统计原因，指出幻觉源于二元分类错误，并论证评估方式如何鼓励猜测行为。

Result: 幻觉不是神秘现象，而是自然统计压力下的产物，由于无法区分错误陈述和事实而产生。

Conclusion: 需要通过修改现有基准测试的评分标准来解决幻觉问题，而不是引入额外的幻觉评估，从而引导领域发展更可信的AI系统。

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 知识图谱的维护成本高昂，传统方法难以保证知识的新鲜度和完整性，需要自动化系统来高效提取和更新知识。

Method: 采用五阶段流水线：缺失事实检测、证据检索、混合知识提取（规则+LLM）、轻量级验证、候选事实排序归一化，并动态生成本体片段确保类型一致性。

Result: 处理超过900万维基百科页面，提取1900万高置信度事实（精度98.8%），覆盖195个谓词，与传统方法相比覆盖度提升显著，平均减少50天更新延迟。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的抽取方法结合本体结构和验证工作流，能够实现可信赖、生产规模的知识获取，具有广泛的现实应用价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but
maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+,
a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of
open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular
components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects
missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting
documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and
ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight
Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator
ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates
ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema
constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195
predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9
million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with
98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional
methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update
lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based
extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can
deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad
real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included

Motivation: 传统知识图谱问答方法依赖语义解析，检索严格必要的知识，但由于模式要求严格和语义模糊性，往往覆盖率较低。需要一种能够检索更广泛相关信息的方法来提升问答效果。

Method: 提出KERAG管道：1）检索可能包含相关信息的大量子图；2）采用检索-过滤-摘要方法；3）使用微调的大型语言模型在知识子图上进行思维链推理，减少噪声。

Result: 实验表明KERAG在质量上超越最先进解决方案约7%，并且超过GPT-4o（工具）10-21%的性能。

Conclusion: KERAG通过更广泛的知识检索和有效的噪声过滤机制，显著提升了知识图谱问答的覆盖率和准确性，为复杂问答任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing,
which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation,
thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and
semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that
enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain
relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined
with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs,
reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions.
Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by
about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while
computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured

performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further
refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important
patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare
applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in
patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study
examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning
techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information
extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for
clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or
decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning
performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs
(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,
GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size
fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning
framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the
zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out
strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院分诊记录含有丰富的医疗信息，但由于数据敏感性、计算资源有限和标注成本高等问题，使得现代NLP技术难以应用。

Method: 首先在GPU上使用2k样本的开源数据对预训练的LLM进行分类器微调，然后在CPU上使用1000样本的医院特定数据进一步微调。

Result: 证明通过精心管理数据集并利用现有模型和开源数据，可以在有限计算资源下成功分类分诊数据。

Conclusion: 该管道方法为医疗机构提供了一种可行的解决方案，能够在保护数据隐私的前提下利用现代NLP技术分析医疗数据。

Abstract: Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a
wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand
Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent
illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing
and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges:
Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to
privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals
and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large
Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify
the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the
datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a
pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited
compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier
using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned
the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We
demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing
models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with
limited compute resources.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否真正理解其生成内容，特别是在幽默这种微妙主题上的理解能力

Method: 使用微调的GPT-4o解码器模型进行幽默理解任务，并与微调的RoBERTa编码器模型进行对比

Result: GPT-4o在幽默理解任务上取得了0.85的平均F1-macro分数，与RoBERTa的0.86分数相当

Conclusion: 最新的解码器模型在幽默理解方面可以达到与最佳编码器模型相当的性能，但模型是否真正理解幽默仍是一个开放性问题

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could
communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field
of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single
model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the
output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills.
Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific
community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they
produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether
computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be
checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that
a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well
as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

TL;DR: 评估小型Transformer模型在短文本多标签情感分类中的效果，发现数据增强能提升性能，而继续预训练会引入噪声，分类头修改效果有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短文本情感分类面临类别不平衡、训练样本少、标签主观性强等挑战，这些因素加剧了数据稀疏性，阻碍有效学习

Method: 评估BERT和RoBERTa等小型Transformer模型，重点分析三个关键因素：领域特定继续预训练、生成式数据增强、分类头架构变化

Result: 数据增强能提高分类性能，但在增强数据集上继续预训练会引入噪声而非提升准确率，分类头修改带来的收益有限

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境下优化BERT模型提供了实用指导，并改进了短文本数据集情感分类策略

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges
such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent
subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the
limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve
ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e.,
BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label
sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings.
Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1)
continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using
automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation,
and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment
results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while
continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than
boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the
classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide
practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained
settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text
datasets.

TL;DR: DQO是一种基于行列式点过程的训练方法，通过联合优化质量和语义多样性来解决LLM微调后输出多样性下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调和强化学习虽然能提升模型性能，但会显著降低输出多样性，导致回答变得狭窄和规范化。现有方法要么在推理时操作，要么只关注词汇差异，无法有效解决语义多样性问题。

Method: 基于行列式点过程(DPPs)，对每个提示采样一组响应并嵌入，通过计算基于核的相似性矩阵的行列式来度量嵌入响应之间的语义多样性（即嵌入向量张成的体积）。

Result: 在指令跟随、摘要、故事生成和推理任务上的实验表明，该方法在不牺牲模型质量的前提下显著提高了语义多样性。

Conclusion: DQO方法成功解决了LLM微调后输出多样性下降的问题，通过联合优化质量和语义多样性，为提升语言模型输出的丰富性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对话AI中生成准确且上下文适度的服务响应仍是严峻挑战，需要明确设计理念上的基本疑问：显式意图识别是否必要。

Method: 使用两个公开服务交互数据集，对比多个状态质语言模型（包括精调T5变体）在两种范式下的表现：意图优先响应生成和直接响应生成。

Result: 通过语言质量和任务成功率指标评估，发现了关于显式意图建模必要性或冗余性的惊人见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了对话AI流水线中的传统假设，为设计更高效和有效的响应生成系统提供了可操作性指南。

Abstract: In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually
appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question
remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating
high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce
effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to
address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available
service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language
models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First
Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics
encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising
insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our
findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines,
offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统研究了大语言模型中人格操控的机制和权衡，比较了上下文学习、参数高效微调和机制导向三种方法，提出了统一评估框架和稳定性分析，并展示了各方法在对齐效果、任务性能和部署等方面的特点和权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中人格操控在客服和代理场景中应用越来越广泛，但其机制和权衡仍不清楚，需要系统研究不同操控方法的效果和特点。

Method: 使用Big Five人格特质模型，比较上下文学习(ICL)、参数高效微调(PEFT)和机制导向(MS)三种方法；构建对比数据集；提出统一评估框架；发展特质粹洁技术；提出三级稳定性框架。

Result: 实验在Gemma-2-2B-IT和LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct上显示：ICL实现强对齐且能力损失最小，PEFT对齐效果最好但任务性能下降，MS提供轻量运行时控制且效果竞争力强。开放性特质最难操控，容许性对ICL抗性最强，人格编码集中在中间层。

Conclusion: 研究将人格操控建立为多级别行为表征探针，连接表面条件化、参数编码和激活层导向，并将机制导向定位为微调的轻量替代方案，既适合部署也有助于可解释性。

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and
trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control
using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL),
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with
balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector
computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified
evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles,
reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU,
GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to
separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap
in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that
quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering
practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment
with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost
of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with
competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely
challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding
consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results
establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral
representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and
activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a
lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and
interpretability.

TL;DR: 语言模型递归训练使用合成数据导致知识崩溃，事实准确性恶化但表面流畅性保持，通过预设指令格式和领域特定训练可有效缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人类写作内容稀缺，大语言模型越来越依赖合成数据，但递归训练导致模型崩溃，威胁事实可靠性。需要研究知识崩溃的特定机制和缓解策略。

Method: 通过控制实验进行递归合成训练，分析不同指令格式对崩溃轨迹的影响，建立结合模型指标和任务指标的评估框架来检测知识退化。

Result: 发现知识崩溃是一个三阶段现象，事实准确性恶化但表面流畅性保持，产生"自信错误"的输出。领域特定合成训练能够显著提高崩溃抵御能力且保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了崩溃动力学的理论见解和可持续AI训练的实践指南，尤其在知识密集型应用中准确性至关重要的场景下。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to
human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated
outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual
reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon
where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating
"confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent
domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we
demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on
instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from
traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We
propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy
that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric
indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases,
enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different
language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse
dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in
knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

TL;DR: AgentSeer是一个基于可观测性的评估框架，用于系统评估AI代理在部署环境中的安全风险，发现传统模型级评估无法检测的代理特有漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型向代理系统过渡，当前的安全评估框架在评估部署特定风险方面存在关键差距，需要新的评估范式来识别代理级特有的安全漏洞。

Method: 通过将代理执行分解为细粒度的动作和组件图，使用HarmBench单轮和迭代精化攻击对GPT-OSS-20B和Gemini-2.0-flash进行跨模型验证。

Result: 发现代理级漏洞比模型级漏洞高24-60%，工具调用是最高风险操作，语义而非句法机制主导漏洞，上下文感知攻击能成功攻破模型级无法攻破的目标。

Conclusion: 研究证实了传统评估存在系统性差距，迫切需要代理情境评估范式，AgentSeer提供了标准化方法和实证验证。

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety
evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific
risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that
decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs,
enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model
validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and
iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between
model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation
reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash
(50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering
while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level
assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We
discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic
contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models.
Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer
operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability
mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside
model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection
strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows
degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash:
28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives
that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These
findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms,
with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明判别词典模型(DLM)无需设立屈折类别即可学习芬兰语名词屈折变化，模型在训练数据上表现优异，测试数据准确率可接受，频率是使用型生产模型性能的主要预测因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究屈折类别是否具有认知现实性，即母语者是否需要发现这些类别才能正确屈折名词，测试DLM模型是否能在不设立屈折类别的情况下理解和产生芬兰语屈折名词。

Method: 使用包含49个屈折类别、2000个高频芬兰语名词的55,271个屈折形式数据集，建立多个DLM理解和生产模型，包括不考虑使用频率的无限暴露学习模型和考虑词频的使用型学习模型。

Result: 模型在训练数据上准确率很高，测试数据准确率下降但仍可接受；模型对类型更多、低频词更多、罕用词更多的生产性屈折类别表现更好，但对非生产性类别的新形式处理困难；使用型生产模型中频率是性能的主要预测因素。

Conclusion: DLM可以在不明确设立屈折类别的情况下学习芬兰语名词屈折系统，频率在使用型学习中起主导作用，生产性屈折类别的学习效果更好，支持了基于使用的语言学习理论。

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional
classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem
changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional
classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up
finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes
are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover
these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their
language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model
(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up
inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000
high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM
comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed
about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite
exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based
perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into
consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed
with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as
expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased
for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more
hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The
model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive
classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive
classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant
predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity
were tenuous or absent.

Conclusion: AFD-SLU框架有效解决了SLU系统中的数据稀缺和计算负担问题，实现了优异的性能表现

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational
systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its
importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the
scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying
Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate
these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that
transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings
(GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces
a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to
align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient
(DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time
feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the
Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score,
and 85.50% overall accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有时间序列基础模型评估中的两个问题：不同模型无法直接比较，以及广泛的任务评测无法准确识别模型的具体强项。

Method: 形式化了3个用通用自然语言描述时间序列的任务：识别（真假问答）、区分（多选题）和生成（开放式描述），并统一四个数据集构建标准化评测环境。

Result: 评测了13种最新模型，发现：(1)纯语言模型表现较差，需要时间序列特定架构；(2)视觉-语言模型表现很好；(3)预训练多模态时间序列-语言模型超过了大语言模型，但仍有提升空间。所有模型在稳健性测试中都显示出脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该评测框架为时间序列推理系统提供了标准化的评估方法，显示了视觉模型在时间序列描述任务中的价值，同时指出了当前模型在稳健性方面的不足。

Abstract: Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed
for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets
already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce
their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for
direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative
strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover
numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities
without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall
performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test
a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)
recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple
choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language
description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model
comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art
language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)
popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time
series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,
identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained
multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still
have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit
clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides
a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning
systems.

Motivation: 调查大语言模型的泛化能力来源：是来自对训练数据的简单记忆，还是真正的深层语义理解。

Method: 提出两角度评估框架：1)通过场景相关问题回答评估模型输出；2)通过探针模型内部表征检测编码的场景元素-参数关联。构建了包含虚构事实描述的场景数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示当前的LLMs主要依赖表面记忆，无法在即使简单的情况下实现稳健的语义场景认知。

Conclusion: 这些发现曝露了LLMs在语义理解方面的严重局限性，为提升其能力提供了认知见解。

Abstract: Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise
from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To
investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess
LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with
their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based
dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated
with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer
scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their
internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations
(internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs
predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust
semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose
critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive
insights for advancing their capabilities.

TL;DR: CURE是一个轻量级框架，通过解耦和抑制概念性捷径来提升预训练语言模型的鲁棒性和公平性，在IMDB和Yelp数据集上分别实现了+10和+2个F1分数的绝对提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然取得了显著成功，但仍然容易受到虚假的概念驱动相关性影响，这会损害模型的鲁棒性和公平性。

Method: 首先通过内容提取器和反转网络提取概念无关的表征，然后使用可控去偏模块通过对比学习精细调整剩余概念线索的影响，使模型能够根据目标任务适当减少有害偏见或利用有益相关性。

Result: 在IMDB和Yelp数据集上使用三种预训练架构进行评估，CURE在IMDB上实现了+10个F1分数的绝对提升，在Yelp上实现了+2个F1分数的提升，同时引入了最小的计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法为对抗概念偏见建立了一个灵活、无监督的蓝图，为更可靠和公平的语言理解系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations
that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel
and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses
conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method
first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content
extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of
task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs
contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual
cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness
beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the
IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an
absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp,
while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a
flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the
way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化临床文本中疾病实体的ICD-10编码过程，可以简化医疗专业人员的工作，确保医院编码的一致性，提高统计和保险目的的效率。

Method: 采用多步骤流水线方法：首先使用临床字典匹配文本中明确的术语，然后对未匹配的术语采用GPT-4.1进行上下文学习来预测ICD-10编码。

Result: 在多语言数据集上表现突出：西班牙语CodiEsp数据集上获得0.89类别F1分和0.78子类别F1分；希腊语ElCardioCC数据集上获得0.85 F1分。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法能够有效地在多语言临床文本中自动进行ICD-10编码，为医疗信息结构化提供了可靠的解决方案，并在不同语言环境中都取得了较高的性能。

Abstract: The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured
information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a
medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International
Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international
standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes.
Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries
will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding
in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to
ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The
approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to
match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with
GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the
dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on
different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on
subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made
them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high
computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose
significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to
this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically
distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given
a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1
regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,
thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even
reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the
vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the
post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific
model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task
objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These
results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of
LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for
model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising
technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation,
particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过稀疏交叉编码器和RelIE指标追踪语言模型预训练中语言特征的演化过程，揭示特征的出现、维护和中断机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的性能测试方法无法反映语言模型如何在预训练中获得语言能力，需要更细粒度地分析表征学习过程

Method: 使用稀疏交叉编码器在不同检查点之间发现对齐特征，并提出新的RelIE指标来追踪特征在任务性能中的因果重要性

Result: 交叉编码器能够检测到预训练过程中特征的出现、维护和中断，方法具有架构无关性和可扩展性

Conclusion: 该方法为预训练过程中表征学习的更可解释和细粒度分析提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during
pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not
well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as
traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models
acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand
model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and
align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the
evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders
between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and
representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects
(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally
important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature
emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more
interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout
pretraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACE-RL框架通过自适应约束增强的强化学习方法，解决了LLM在长文本生成中的质量问题，无需依赖稀缺的高质量数据，在多个基准测试中显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在长文本生成中面临两个主要问题：过度依赖稀缺的高质量训练数据，以及只关注粗粒度的质量优化维度，忽略了不同长文本生成场景的细粒度需求。

Method: 提出ACE-RL框架：1)自动将指令解构为细粒度的自适应约束标准；2)设计基于约束满足度的奖励机制；3)使用强化学习指导模型生成高质量长文本。

Result: 在WritingBench基准上分别超越SFT和RL基线20.70%和7.32%，最佳模型甚至超越GPT-4o达7.10%。

Conclusion: ACE-RL为LLM提供了一个更有效的训练范式，能够在多样化的长文本生成场景中生成高质量内容。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in
high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two
limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response
data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in
reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization
dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the
fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced
reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first
automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,
adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.
Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of
long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,
converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,
we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form
generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL
framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and
7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary
systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for
LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了ToM-SSI新基准测试，用于评估基础模型在复杂社交互动和空间动态环境中的心理理论能力，突破了传统Sally-Anne测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理理论基准测试主要基于Sally-Anne测试变体，视角有限且忽略了人类社交互动的复杂性，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 设计多模态基准测试ToM-SSI，包含最多4个代理的群体互动，代理在情境环境中进行沟通和移动，支持混合合作-阻碍设置和多代理心理状态并行推理。

Result: 评估显示当前模型在这些新任务上的表现仍然严重受限，特别是在复杂社交推理方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: ToM-SSI基准测试揭示了现有模型在复杂社交认知方面的关键差距，为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on
variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on
ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this
gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM
capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial
dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic
interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to
four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique
design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive
settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus
capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our
evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely
limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端重写方法在处理查询中多个模糊表达时存在困难，无法同时识别和重写多个位置。

Method: 采用迭代重写方案，基于澄清问题进行交替生成：先生成澄清问题，然后基于回答重写查询，不断迭代改进。

Result: 实验结果显示ICR在澄清-重写迭代过程中能够持续提升检索性能。

Conclusion: ICR框架有效解决了多模糊表达问题，在两个流行数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end
rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple
fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous
identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an
iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this
framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and
rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously
improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process,
thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

Conclusion: 投散基于训练提供了一种可行的替代方案，适用于数据受限的语言学习场景

Abstract: We present a masked diffusion language modeling framework for data-efficient
training for the BabyLM 2025 Challenge. Our approach applies diffusion training
objectives to language modeling under strict data constraints, incorporating
frequency-informed masking that prioritizes learning from rare tokens while
maintaining theoretical validity. We explore multiple noise scheduling
strategies, including two-mode approaches, and investigate different noise
weighting schemes within the NELBO objective. We evaluate our method on the
BabyLM benchmark suite, measuring linguistic competence, world knowledge, and
human-likeness. Results show performance competitive to hybrid
autoregressive-masked baselines, demonstrating that diffusion-based training
offers a viable alternative for data-restricted language learning.

TL;DR: Entropy2Vec是一个利用单语语言模型熵来生成跨语言表示的新框架，通过模型预测的不确定性来捕捉语言间的类型学关系，避免了传统类型学清单的特征稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统类型学清单存在特征稀疏和静态快照的问题，需要一种能够动态捕捉语言间结构相似性的新方法。

Method: 通过训练单语语言模型，利用其预测熵来反映语言间的结构相似性：低熵表示高相似性，高熵表示较大差异，从而生成密集的非稀疏语言嵌入。

Result: 实证评估显示Entropy2Vec嵌入与既定类型学类别一致，在多语言NLP任务（如LinguAlchemy框架中的任务）中表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: Entropy2Vec提供了一种有效的方法来捕捉语言间的类型学关系，生成的嵌入可用于下游多语言NLP应用。

Abstract: We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual
language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language
models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature
sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in
language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By
training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy
of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low
entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater
divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are
adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established
typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream
multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

*Chang Dai,Hongyu Shan,Mingyang Song,Di Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HoPE是一种基于双曲几何的新型位置编码方法，通过洛伦兹变换解决RoPE在长序列建模中的振荡问题，实现了注意力权重随距离单调衰减，在长序列外推任务上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法存在局限性：绝对位置编码难以外推到更长序列，相对位置编码如Alibi在极长上下文上性能下降，而广泛使用的RoPE存在振荡注意力模式阻碍长距离依赖建模

Method: 从双曲几何中的洛伦兹变换获得灵感，提出双曲旋转位置编码(HoPE)，使用双曲函数对token表示进行洛伦兹旋转，理论证明RoPE是其特例

Result: 在多个扩展序列基准测试的困惑度评估中，HoPE始终优于现有位置编码方法，表现出更强的长距离依赖表示和泛化能力

Conclusion: HoPE从根本上解决了RoPE的振荡问题，通过强制注意力权重随token距离增加而单调衰减，显著提升了长序列建模性能

Abstract: Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential
structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional
encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed
positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit
performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary
Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that
hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations
through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration
from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic
Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to
implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE
fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of
attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental
results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence
benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding
methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing
and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解释性方法无法捕捉代理式LLM的推理路径、规划逻辑和系统性影响，在高风险领域部署时需要更强的透明度和可信度。

Method: 提出TAXAL三元融合框架，整合认知维度（用户理解）、功能维度（实用效用）和因果维度（忠实推理），提供角色敏感的解释设计基础。

Result: 通过法律、教育、医疗和公共服务等案例研究，展示了TAXAL框架在不同制度约束和利益相关者角色下的适应性。

Conclusion: TAXAL将概念清晰性与设计模式和部署路径相结合，推进了解释性作为技术和社会技术实践的发展，支持代理式AI时代可信赖的LLM应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk
domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and
accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs,
do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of
agentic LLMs.
  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a
triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive
(user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful
reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing,
evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.
  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution
and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them
within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability
through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services,
showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and
stakeholder roles.
  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways,
TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice,
supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of
agentic AI.

Motivation: 开发支持多语言翻译的开源模型，特别关注汉语与少数民族语言及方言的翻译需求，并通过慢思考模式提升测试时性能。

Method: 采用整体训练流程：通用和MT导向的预训练建立基础能力，监督微调进行任务适配，强化学习和弱到强RL进行高级对齐。Chimera模型集成多个参数设置下的输出。

Result: 两个模型在同等参数规模的翻译专用模型和大多数SOTA大模型上表现显著优越，特别是在汉语与少数民族语言及方言翻译任务上。WMT2025共享任务中31个语言对中30个排名第一。

Conclusion: Hunyuan-MT模型在多语言翻译任务中表现出色，特别是在低资源语言处理上具有强大鲁棒性，为多语言翻译提供了有效的开源解决方案。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source
multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across
33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between
Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects.
Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance
model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a
translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates
multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter
settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional
slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our
models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for
multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented
pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced
alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through
comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and
Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models
of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on
the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as
dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31
language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a
diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as
Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including
Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了难度感知推理框架，让模型根据问题复杂度动态调整推理深度，无需修改架构，只需在按难度比例整理的数据上进行后训练。SFT主要捕获推理长度和格式模式，DPO保持推理准确性，两者结合可减少长度并维持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维推理虽然强大，但对于简单问题会产生不必要的冗长输出，需要让模型能够根据问题难度动态调整推理深度。

Method: 通过后训练方法，使用按问题难度比例整理的链式思维轨迹数据，结合监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)来训练模型。

Result: 模型学会了"按比例思考"，在简单问题上进行最小化推理，在复杂问题上保持深度推理，同时维持或提高了性能表现。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了难度感知的动态推理，证明了模型可以通过训练学会根据问题复杂度自适应调整推理深度，无需架构修改。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose
output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware
reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on
problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such
dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply
post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces
that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals
that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns
like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO)
preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and
maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative
assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning
minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

Motivation: 检验均匀信息密度假设(UID)在语言产出中的作用，特别是在可选补语连接词that的使用上，以及改进之前基于动词子类化概率的估测方法

Method: 分析大规模当代会话语料库，使用机器学习和神经语言模型来精炼信息密度的估计，对比上下文词向量估计与传统的动词子类化概率法

Result: 复现了信息密度低时更可能省略that的关系，发现传统方法存在词汇特异性变异，而上下文词向量法能够解释更多的补语连接词使用模式变异

Conclusion: 上下文词向量提供了更优称的信息密度估量，支持UID假设在语言产出中的重要性，并为语言变异性研究提供了更精细的度量方法

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform
Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this
variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during
language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction,
we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in
English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low
information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research
by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using
machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information
density. Our results replicated the established relationship between
information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that
previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs'
subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical
variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings
account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

Motivation: 研究线性复杂度序列模型中衰减机制的设计原理和效果，为改进序列建模性能提供理论指导和实践洞察。

Method: 通过系统分析衰减机制的四个关键设计维度（参数化策略、参数共享、衰减粒度、RoPE兼容性），并在多种语言建模任务上进行大量实验验证。

Result: 发现衰减参数需要精细调节在特定范围内；参数共享不当会导致性能显著下降；向量衰减通常优于标量衰减；RoPE对大多数线性注意力机制无实际益处。

Conclusion: 线性复杂度序列模型的衰减机制设计需要精心考虑多个维度，不同配置对性能有显著影响，为未来模型设计提供了重要指导原则。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms
inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the
design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:
parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for
decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary
parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus
vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding
methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series
of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered
several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy
for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that
effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of
parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may
cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly
impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,
scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.
However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,
scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our
analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding
method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear
attention mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子机器学习的发展，现有经典机器学习的安全监控方法无法直接应用于QML，需要专门的安全机制

Method: 基于SafeML方法，采用量子中心距离度量来评估模型准确性，进行模型依赖的后分类评估

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上的实验表明，该方法能够检测操作数据与训练数据之间的距离，实现知情的人工监督

Conclusion: Q-SafeML为量子机器学习提供了有效的安全监控解决方案，增强了系统透明度和安全性

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

Result: 所提出的损失函数结合换手率正则化，在算法交易指标评估中优于传统的均方误差损失函数，提高了交易策略和投资组合优化的预测性能。

Conclusion: 金融基础指标能够显著提升深度学习模型在金融预测任务中的性能，为金融领域的AI应用提供了更合适的评估框架。

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

Abstract: The patterns of inhalation and exhalation contain important physiological
signals that can be used to anticipate human behavior, health trends, and vital
parameters. Human activity recognition (HAR) is fundamentally connected to
these vital signs, providing deeper insights into well-being and enabling
real-time health monitoring. This work presents i-Mask, a novel HAR approach
that leverages exhaled breath patterns captured using a custom-developed mask
equipped with integrated sensors. Data collected from volunteers wearing the
mask undergoes noise filtering, time-series decomposition, and labeling to
train predictive models. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of
the approach, achieving over 95\% accuracy and highlighting its potential in
healthcare and fitness applications.

*Minqi Jiang,Andrei Lupu,Yoram Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exploratory Iteration (ExIt) 是一种自课程强化学习方法，通过选择性采样信息量最大的中间状态来训练LLM进行多步自我改进，在推理时能够超越训练时的迭代深度限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在处理自我改进任务时假设固定的最大迭代深度，这既成本高昂又具有任意性。需要一种方法能够训练智能体在推理时进行可靠的多步自我改进。

Method: ExIt方法通过选择性采样训练过程中遇到的最具信息量的中间部分历史记录，将这些起点视为新的自我迭代任务实例来训练自我改进策略，并可结合显式探索机制维持任务多样性。

Result: 在数学竞赛、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域，ExIt策略能够产生在保留任务实例上表现出强推理时自我改进能力的策略，并且能够在超出训练时平均迭代深度的步数预算内迭代达到更高性能。

Conclusion: ExIt方法成功解决了传统固定深度迭代的限制，为LLM的多步自我改进提供了一种有效的训练框架，在多个实际应用领域都展现出了良好的性能。

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

TL;DR: 通过基于测试实例的适应性采样框架，构建简洁且信息丰富的训练数据集，提高逆向问题学习的样本效率

Motivation: 传统学习方法需要从先验分布中抽取大量训练样本，当先验高维或需高精度时数据收集成本昂贵，需要更高效的采样策略

Method: 提出实例沿适应性采样框架，根据具体测试实例动态分配采样努力，通过迭代精炼条件于最新预测的训练数据集，使其适配每个测试实例周围的逆吐映射几何结构

Conclusion: 该适应性采样策略具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他逆吐问题，为传统固定数据集训练模式提供了可扩展且实用的替代方案

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Motivation: 现有ADMET预测方法主要依赖单任务学习，无法充分利用任务间的互补性，且计算资源消耗大。需要开发能够有效利用任务相关性并提高效率的多任务学习框架。

Conclusion: 量子信息特征增强和自适应任务加权的多任务分子学习具有有效性和高效性，为ADMET预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

Motivation: 现有的代表性相似性测量缺乏系统性比较，需要量化评估它们在不同模型家族间的区分能力

Method: 使用dprime、轩边系数和ROC-AUC三种补充性区分度量，系统评估RSA、线性预测性、Procrustes和软匹配等常用测量的区分能力

Conclusion: 提供了第一个通过区分能力视角系统比较相似性测量的研究，为大规模模型和脑比较选择适当测量提供指导

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将共形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供了有效的有限样本不确定性量化框架，解决了无限维空间中的覆盖保证问题。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: 转导共形预测中存在置信度与效率的基本权衡，高置信度要求必然导致预测集大小的指数增长，这一理论界限为实际应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

Result: 发现通过transformer的表征演化可以解释为恢复分类最优特征的轨迹。

Conclusion: 注意力机制与多项式回归之间存在深刻的数学联系，这为理解transformer内部机制提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

TL;DR: 本文研究差分隐私下的随机凸优化问题，针对满足Tsybakov噪声条件且梯度具有有界矩的损失函数，提出了新的隐私保护算法，获得了与Lipschitz常数无关的效用上界，并建立了相应的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私随机凸优化研究通常假设损失函数是Lipschitz连续的，但在实际应用中这一假设可能过于严格。本文旨在研究更一般的场景，即损失函数可能具有极大或无界的Lipschitz常数，但梯度具有有界矩的情况。

Method: 针对满足Tsybakov噪声条件且梯度具有有界k阶矩的损失函数，设计了(ε,δ)-差分隐私算法。首先处理θ≥2的Lipschitz情况，然后扩展到θ≥θ̅>1的更一般情况，并分析了小隐私预算下的性能。

Result: 获得了与Lipschitz常数无关的效用上界：Õ((r̃_{2k}(1/√n + √d/(nε))^{(k-1)/k})^{θ/(θ-1)})。对于小隐私预算情况，即使损失函数非Lipschitz，也能获得类似上界。同时建立了ρ-zero集中差分隐私的下界。

Conclusion: 本文突破了传统Lipschitz假设的限制，在更一般的Tsybakov噪声条件和梯度有界矩假设下，成功设计了差分隐私算法并获得了紧致的效用界限，为处理更广泛的实际问题提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁现象是气候系统、生态系统、金融市场等复杂系统韧性降低的标志性特征，往往预示着难以预测但影响重大的临界状态转变。虽然深度学习在预测临界点方面表现出强大能力，但其在检测闪烁模式方面的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，在由简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练，然后测试模型在各种随机系统和真实数据集上的泛化能力。

Result: 模型能够准确识别闪烁模式，成功检测到睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代理数据中的闪烁现象，表明深度学习可以从噪声非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号。

Conclusion: 深度学习提供了一个灵活的框架，能够跨广泛动力系统识别不稳定性，为预测临界状态转变提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

Method: 提出NSF方法，通过p指数扩展第二矩项，支持正负指数，并采用周期性调度来实现频谱重新加权和信息融合。

Result: 理论和实验证明：适配方法偏重低频信息，SGD近伪中性，负指数放大高频信息。周期调度扩展了频谱覆盖范围，改善了跨频带融合，在几个标准测试集上一致降低了测试误差。

Conclusion: NSF揭示了优化器作为主动谱控制器的作用，提供了一个统一、可控制和高效的一阶优化框架。

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

*Yuzhu Chen,Yingjie Wang,Shunyu Liu,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoVeR是一种基于共形预测框架的无模型解码策略，能够在保持紧凑搜索空间的同时确保对期望轨迹的高覆盖概率，解决了传统解码方法缺乏可证明覆盖保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流解码策略（如beam search）虽然能生成合理的候选集，但缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，难以有效平衡搜索效率与多样化轨迹需求，特别是在需要长尾序列的真实应用中。

Method: 提出CoVeR方法，基于共形预测框架构建模型无关的解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界。

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地达到至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平。

Conclusion: CoVeR为解决解码策略的覆盖保证问题提供了理论可靠且实用的解决方案，特别适用于需要确保多样化轨迹覆盖的应用场景。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con框架通过探索不同的统计散度和相似性核函数，系统性地发现了新的损失函数，在无监督聚类、监督对比学习和降维任务中均取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I-Con框架发现现有表示学习方法隐含地最小化数据分布与学习分布之间的KL散度，但KL散度的不对称性和无界性可能导致优化问题与真实目标不一致。

Method: 提出Beyond I-Con框架，通过系统探索替代的统计散度（如总变差距离、有界f-散度）和相似性核函数（如距离核代替角度核）来发现新的损失函数。

Result: 在DINO-ViT嵌入的无监督聚类中达到SOTA；在监督对比学习中超越标准方法；在降维任务中比SNE获得更好的定性结果和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 统计散度和相似性核函数的选择对表示学习优化至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

TL;DR: VARMAformer结合了现代Transformer架构和经典VARMA统计模型，通过VARMA特征提取器和增强注意力机制，在时间序列预测中实现了更好的全局和局部依赖关系建模，显著超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的简化Transformer架构（如CATS）虽然提高了效率和准确性，但可能忽略了经典统计模型（如VARMA）能够有效捕捉的细粒度局部时间依赖性。

Method: 提出VARMAformer架构，包含两个关键创新：1）VARMA启发的特征提取器（VFE），在patch级别显式建模自回归和移动平均模式；2）VARMA增强注意力机制（VE-atten），使用时序门使查询更具上下文感知能力。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上进行大量实验，证明该模型始终优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作验证了将经典统计洞察融入现代深度学习框架对时间序列预测的显著益处，成功融合了全局长期依赖和局部统计结构。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

Motivation: 混淆矩阵值同时受到类别相似性（模型混淆程度）和分布偏差（训练测试集分布倾斜）的影响，难以区分两者的独立贡献，需要一种方法来解耦这些误差源。

Method: 使用迭代比例拟合进行双随机归一化，这是行和列归一化的泛化方法，能够恢复类别相似性的底层结构。

Conclusion: 双随机归一化提供了一种有效工具来理解混淆矩阵背后的因素，为分类器评估和改进提供了更深入的洞察。

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

Motivation: 标准MLP-based PINNs在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致违反因果关系和低频谱偏差问题，需要新的架构来解决这些局限性。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE的优势，成功解决了PINNs中的谱偏差和因果性问题，为复杂PDE求解提供了有效的神经网络框架。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further

TL;DR: 本文研究测试时适配(TTA)的稳定性问题，发现batch norm层是影响稳定性的关键因素，并提出了SAR和SAR²方法来解决模型崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际部署中TTA方法在混合分布偏移、小批次大小和不平衡标签分布偏移时可能失效或造成次要损害，这是阻碍TTA在真实世界应用的关键障碍。

Method: 首先分析了batch norm层对TTA稳定性的影响，提出使用group norm或layer norm。然后设计了SAR方法：1)移除棒度过大的噪声样本 2)鼓励模型权重进入平坦最低点。在SAR基础上提出SAR²：1)重复性正则化器减少特征相关性 2)不公平正则化器最大化原型识别预测的呈权。

Result: 实验结果表明新方法在各种野外测试场景下都能更稳定地运行，计算效率高，显著改善了TTA的稳定性。

Conclusion: 识别了TTA不稳定的根本原因，提出的SAR和SAR²方法能够有效防止模型崩溃，提高适配稳定性，为TTA在真实世界中的应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Conclusion: 对于深度神经网络，需要从输入层到输出层逐步增加激活方差，提出的分层深度感知初始化方法能有效改善网络训练效果

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统方法在处理参数化偏微分方程时需要针对每个具体任务进行微调的问题，开发一个能够零样本泛化到广泛PDE类别的多物理神经算子，提高计算效率和准确性。

Method: 使用基于Swin Transformer的超网络结合混合监督：1）通过制造解方法生成的解析解标记数据；2）使用物理信息目标优化的未标记样本。模型将PDE参数映射到目标物理信息神经网络，并引入迭代细化程序生成增量PINN来逐步减少误差。

Conclusion: HyPINO展示了作为扩展神经算子解决日益复杂的非线性高维PDE问题的基础方法的潜力，具有显著提高的精度和降低的计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Result: 细粒度标签训练并非普遍有效，其效果高度依赖于数据几何结构与标签层次的关系，以及数据集大小和模型容量等条件

Conclusion: 细粒度标签训练的效果具有条件依赖性，需要根据具体的数据特征和模型条件来评估是否采用这种策略

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

Motivation: 传统学习理论主要关注非自适应（oblivious）对手，但现实世界中对手往往能够拦截学习者请求的样本并根据样本信息进行自适应操纵，这需要新的理论框架来研究此类对抗环境下的学习问题。

Method: 提出了一个考虑对手预算的通用可学习性概念，对比分析了加性自适应对手和加性非自适应对手下的学习能力差异。

Conclusion: 自适应对手模型提供了更现实的对抗学习框架，其可学习性要求比传统非自适应对手模型更高，这对实际对抗环境下的机器学习算法设计具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

Result: 在大幅减少内存占用的同时保持了准确性，持续超过之前的结构化和半结构化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效且完全兼容现有推理流程的实用方案，为高效长上下文LLM部署解决了关键问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

Conclusion: 移位操作能有效改善目标条件强化学习的性能，移位量的选择与系统动力学特性相关，为低秩近似提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing

Abstract: This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to
large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to
data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication,
computation, and memory. We propose FedSub, an efficient subspace algorithm for
federated learning on heterogeneous data. Specifically, FedSub utilizes
subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

TL;DR: 提出基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)的可解释性方法，用于检测电力系统自动发电控制(AGC)中的虚假数据注入攻击(FDIA)，检测率高达95.97%，误报率低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AGC系统容易受到隐蔽的网络攻击，特别是虚假数据注入攻击(FDIA)，这些攻击会破坏系统稳定性但能逃避传统检测方法。现有方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)作为可解释的FDIA检测方法，能够提取符号方程，考虑系统非线性特性。模型离线训练学习不同运行场景下AGC测量值之间的复杂非线性关系，训练后可提取描述模型行为的符号公式。

Result: 提出的KAN模型实现了高达95.97%的FDIA检测率，符号公式版本的检测率为95.9%，同时保持较低的误报率。

Conclusion: KAN模型为增强AGC系统网络安全提供了可靠且可解释的方法，能够有效检测隐蔽的网络攻击，同时提供比大多数机器学习模型更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Motivation: 深度强化学习计算需求增长引发环境和经济成本抑问，但算法能源消耗、温室气体排放和财务成本研究缺失

Method: 对DQN、TRPO、A2C、ARS、PPO、RecurrentPPO和QR-DQN等7种先进DRL算法进行系统性基准测试，在10个Atari 2600游戏上训练100万步，实时测量功耗并估算能源消耗、CO2排放和电费成本

Result: 算法间能源效率差异显著，某些算法在保持性能同时能源消耗降低24%（ARS vs DQN），CO2排放降低68%，财务成本降低68%（QR-DQN vs RecurrentPPO）

Conclusion: 通过算法选择可以在不牺牲学习性能的前提下降低环境和经济影响，为可持续强化学习实践提供可行见解并为未来算法设计评估研究奠定基础

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

TL;DR: SpikingBrain是一个受大脑启发的模型家族，通过线性/混合线性注意力架构、脉冲神经元和专用硬件优化，解决了Transformer模型在长序列处理中的二次计算复杂度和线性内存增长问题，在非NVIDIA平台上实现了高效的长上下文训练和推理。


<details>

Motivation: 主流Transformer大语言模型面临训练计算随序列长度二次增长、推理内存线性增长的效率瓶颈，且在非NVIDIA平台上构建大模型存在稳定性和效率挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了大脑启发机制在推动下一代高效可扩展大模型设计方面的潜力，证明了在非NVIDIA平台上进行大规模LLM开发的可行性。

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统手动调整广告推荐系统的排名效用函数存在调整目标不理惵、参数组合过多、缺乏个性化和季节性适应性等问题，导致效果次优

Method: 提出DRL-PUT框架：1)将问题形式化为强化学习任务，根据广告请求状态预测最优超参数；2)直接从在线服务日志学习最优策略模型，避免估计价值函数的挑战

Result: 在Pinterest广告推荐系统中的在线A/B实验显示：与基准手动调整方法相比，DRL-PUT在处理段将点击率提高9.7%，长时间点击率提高7.7%

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架能够有效解决广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，实现了更好的平台、广告主和用户价值平衡，具有重要的实践价值

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

Abstract: This study presents the development of a domain-responsive edge-aware
multiscale Graph Neural Network for predicting steady, turbulent flow and
thermal behavior in a two-dimensional channel containing arbitrarily shaped
complex pin-fin geometries. The training dataset was constructed through an
automated framework that integrated geometry generation, meshing, and
flow-field solutions in ANSYS Fluent. The pin-fin geometry was parameterized
using piecewise cubic splines, producing 1,000 diverse configurations through
Latin Hypercube Sampling. Each simulation was converted into a graph structure,
where nodes carried a feature vector containing spatial coordinates, a
normalized streamwise position, one-hot boundary indicators, and a signed
distance to the nearest boundary such as wall. This graph structure served as
input to the newly developed Graph Neural Network, which was trained to predict
temperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure at each node using data from
ANSYS. The network predicted fields with outstanding accuracy, capturing
boundary layers, recirculation, and the stagnation region upstream of the
pin-fins while reducing wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In conclusion,
the novel graph neural network offered a fast and reliable surrogate for
simulations in complex flow configurations.

Abstract: A simple nonholonomic dynamics model is developed as a low-order model for
generating undulatory swim-like motions, validated through computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations. The rigid-body-dynamics model generates swimming
motion by imposing a nonholonomic (NH) constraint on the tail of a two-body
system, requiring that tail-fin velocity aligns with the tail angle under rigid
fluid idealization, while the head moves in a straight line. The system has one
degree of freedom, with equations of motion derived using Lagrange multipliers.
Two-dimensional CFD simulations validate the model in an incompressible
Newtonian fluid, where the resolved tail fin interacts with fluid through the
immersed boundary method until steady-state swimming is achieved. The
validation demonstrates excellent quantitative agreement between CFD and model
predictions for body orientation angle and normal fluid force across variations
in fin motion amplitude, period, and Reynolds number. While an exact NH
constraint point does not exist, an effective period-averaged NH location can
be identified for successful model predictions. At higher Reynolds numbers, the
two-body kinematics displays independence from the Reynolds number variation.
The CFD data reveal that the two-body model captures the type of power-law
relationship between Reynolds and Strouhal numbers governing undulatory
swimming from tadpoles to whales, indicating that the simplified two-link model
is representative of swimming dynamics in continuous geometries at various
scales. The results demonstrate that the low-order NH constraint-based model
effectively captures essential swimming dynamics, offering a robust alternative
to existing fluid-force models.

Abstract: This review summarizes recent advances in the theoretical analysis of the
stability of magnetized flows in a non-uniformly rotating layer of electrically
conductive nanofluid, incorporating the effects of Brownian diffusion and
thermophoresis. In the absence of temperature gradients, different forms of
magnetorotational instability (MRI): standard (SMRI), azimuthal (AMRI), and
helical (HMRI) are investigated for nanofluid layers subjected to axial,
azimuthal, and helical magnetic fields. The corresponding growth rates and
instability regions are analyzed in relation to the rotation profile
(quantified by the Rossby number $\textrm{Ro}$) and the radial wave number $k$.
When temperature gradients and nanoparticle concentration effects are present,
stationary convective modes in both axial and helical magnetic fields are
examined under conditions of non-uniform rotation. Analytical expressions for
the critical Rayleigh number $\textrm{Ra}_{st}$ are derived, and neutral
stability curves are constructed as functions of the angular velocity profile,
the azimuthal magnetic field inhomogeneity (magnetic Rossby number
$\textrm{Rb}$), and the wave number $k$. The study identifies and discusses key
mechanisms responsible for the stabilization or destabilization of stationary
convection in axial and spiral magnetic field configurations, highlighting the
role of nanoparticle-driven effects in modifying classical magnetoconvective
behavior.

Abstract: The background-oriented Schlieren technique has emerged as a promising method
for visualizing density gradients and performing quantitative measurements.
However, an inherent constraint of BOS is the compromise between spatial
resolution and measurement sensitivity, as the BOS camera typically remains
focused on the background pattern. To overcome the resolution-sensitivity
constraint, a new variant of BOS based on nominally directional rays has been
proposed in this paper. Instead of utilizing diffusively reflective background
patterns, a spherically concave mirror etched with random dots has been used to
create a dotted background that reflects rays directionally. Combined with
coaxial LED light illumination, we demonstrate that the current setup can
improve the spatial resolution of canonical BOS without compromising
measurement sensitivity. Moreover, the proposed setup decouples the requirement
of a small lens aperture to achieve a large depth of field, thereby
significantly alleviating the need for strong background light illumination in
high-speed BOS applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method in improving the BOS spatial resolution, both synthetic BOS image
generations and experiments on low- and high-speed jets are conducted. Results
show that the proposed variant of BOS can be advantageous for measuring
density-varying flows with a limited field of view.

Abstract: We use direct numerical simulation (DNS) to investigate mass transfer between
liquid steel and slag during a metallurgical secondary refinement process
through two reduced-scale water experiments, which reproduce the dynamics seen
in an industrial bottom-blown ladle. A container is filled with water and
topped by a thin layer of oil, representing the molten steel and slag,
respectively. The system is agitated by a bubble plume that impinges on the oil
layer and forms an open-eye. A tracer species, dissolved in the water, acts as
a passive scalar that is progressively absorbed into the oil layer. Both the
hydrodynamics and mass transfer in the system are studied and compared with
experiments from the literature of different size and geometry.
  The numerical simulation of mass transfer is challenging due to the high
P\'eclet number, leading to extremely thin species boundary layers at the
interface. Resolving the boundary layer is prohibitive even with adaptive grid
techniques. A subgrid-scale (SGS) boundary layer model corrects the scalar
transport equation, allowing us to solve convection-dominated transport on
relatively coarse grids. The hydrodynamics is investigated, and we analyze how
the resultant flow field governs mass transport. The numerical results recover
two flow regimes: a quasi-steady regime at low flow rates with small
deformations of the oil-water interface and an atomizing regime at large flow
rates. Interfacial species transport is determined to be dominated in an
annulus surrounding the open eye caused by a shear layer at the oil-water
interface. It is observed that we achieve grid-independent macroscopic
quantities that match relatively well with those observed in experiments,

### [204] [A quantitative analysis of leading edge vortices in flapping wing aerodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05040)
*Alejandro Gonzalo,Manuel Garcia-Villalba,Oscar Flores*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出了一种定量分析前缘涡(LEV)的方法，包括涡结构识别、涡核提取和流场量计算，应用于中等雷诺数前飞扑翼的流场分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前缘涡是扑翼空气动力学中最重要的升力增强机制之一，需要定量描述方法来深入理解其特性和演化规律。

Method: 采用Q准则识别涡结构，使用细化算法提取LEV涡核，基于局部平均涡量向量方向进行判别，在垂直于涡核的平面上计算相关流场量。

Result: 在中等雷诺数前飞扑翼流场中，LEV在下拍前半段发展增长，环量平滑增加；中拍时开始分裂，下游部分向尾迹输运但环量保持恒定；发现翼段升力与局部环量存在关联。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效定量描述LEV的几何特征和流场特性，揭示了LEV在扑翼运动中的演化规律及其与升力产生的关联。

Abstract: The leading edge vortex (LEV) is one of the most important lift augmentation
mechanisms in flapping wing aerodynamics. We propose a methodology that aims to
provide a quantitative description of the LEV. The first step of the method
consists of the identification of the vortical structures surrounding the wing
using the Q criterion. The impact of the employed threshold is shown to be
minor, not influencing the observed trends. In the second step we identify the
core of the LEV using a thinning algorithm, discriminating the LEV using the
orientation of the locally averaged vorticity vector. Finally, we compute
relevant flow quantities along the LEV core, by averaging in planes
perpendicular to the local vorticity at the LEV core points. We have applied
this methodology to flow data corresponding to a pair of wings performing a
flapping motion in forward flight at moderate Reynolds number. We have
performed a geometrical characterization of the LEV, and we have computed
several flow quantities along the LEV core. For the particular configuration
under study, we have shown that the LEV, during the first half of the
downstroke develops and grows increasing its circulation smoothly.
Approximately at mid-downstroke the leading edge vortex starts splitting, and
its downstream part is advected towards the wake while keeping its circulation
rather constant. Finally, we have briefly explored the link between the
sectional lift on the wing and the local circulation obtained with the present
methodology.

### [205] [The Ethical Compass of the Machine: Evaluating Large Language Models for Decision Support in Construction Project Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04505)
*Somtochukwu Azie,Yiping Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型在建筑项目管理中的伦理决策能力，发现LLMs在法律合规等结构化领域表现良好，但在处理情境细微差别、确保问责制和提供透明推理方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在建筑项目管理中的加速应用，需要批判性评估LLMs在这种伦理敏感、高风险决策环境中的伦理可行性和可靠性。

Method: 采用混合研究方法：定量测试两个领先LLM在12个真实伦理场景中的表现（使用新型伦理决策支持评估清单EDSAC），以及对12位行业专家进行半结构化访谈的定性分析。

Result: LLMs在结构化领域（如法律合规）表现良好，但在处理情境细微差别、确保问责制和透明推理方面存在显著缺陷。利益相关者对AI自主进行伦理判断持保留态度，强烈主张需要强有力的人类监督。

Conclusion: LLMs目前最适合作为决策支持工具而非自主伦理代理，研究提供了EDSAC框架作为可复制方法学，并给出了实用建议。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

*Wenxiao Wang,Priyatham Kattakinda,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来最大化智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置而固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和配置的联合优化方法。

Method: 提出Maestro框架，在明确的rollout/token预算约束下，联合搜索智能体的图结构（模块和信息流）和节点配置（模型、提示、工具、控制参数），并利用轨迹中的反思性文本反馈来优先编辑。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均优于MIPROv2、GEPA和GEPA+Merge分别12%、4.9%和4.86%；即使仅限于提示优化，仍领先9.65%、2.37%和2.41%，且使用比GEPA少得多的rollout次数。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决单纯提示调优无法解决的结构性故障模式，在多个应用中显示出显著优势，证明了整体优化方法的有效性。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

*Philippe J. Giabbanelli,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个步骤框架，通过混合方法识别健康相关利益相关者的信息需求，并指导LLM生成重点突出、适配不同用户群体的模拟结果解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建模与模拟(M&S)技术在健康领域有重要价值，但模型复杂性导致利益相关者无法有效利用。当前LLM生成的统一摘要无法满足不同用户群体的个性化需求。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：首先引导多样化健康利益相关者提供解释需求和风格偏好，然后优化LLM的可控属性调整能力，最后通过多维度指标进行评估和改进。

Result: 该框架能够生成更加适配不同健康利益相关者(如临床医生、政策制定者、患者等)需求的尺度化解释内容。

Conclusion: 研究为解决健康M&S模型的可访问性问题提供了系统化方法，通过根据利益相关者特定需求来尺度化LLM生成的解释，最大化模型在健康决策支持中的影响力。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人类认知标准增强AI基准测试的新方法，通过人类访谈和调查识别关键认知技能，为AI模型评估提供更人性化的框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI基准测试难以捕捉模型的细微能力，特别是在物理世界建模方面，需要更符合人类认知的评价标准

Method: 基于Perception Test和OpenEQA基准，进行深度访谈和大规模调查，识别Prioritization、Memorizing、Discerning、Contextualizing等关键认知技能

Result: 研究发现参与者认为AI缺乏解释性和共情能力，但对AI性能有很高期望；提出了整合人类认知洞察的基准设计框架

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了以用户为中心的AI评估重要性，为研究人员提供了将AI能力与人类认知过程对齐的实用指南，改进了当前基准测试实践并为未来AI模型评估奠定了基础

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

### [209] [Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇位置文章提出使用大语言模型动态生成层次架构来构建明确的世界模型，以解决复杂多代理任务中的探索困难和稀疏奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能发展中，语言模型和代理模型已经取得重大进展，但明确的世界模型仍是关键瓶颈，尤其在复杂长时域多代理任务中。标准强化学习在高保真度但结构平坦的模拟器中常常失败，因为探索空间过于复杂且奖励稀疏。

Method: 通过对2024年多代理足球研究的系统评审，发现了向于将符号化和层次方法与多代理强化学习结合的明显趋势。这些方法隐式或明确构建任务基于的世界模型来指导代理学习。文章提出了一种范式转变：利用大语言模型动态生成层次架构，通过语言来动态结构化世界模型。

Result: 语言驱动的世界模型提供了内在的课程设计，浓密且有意义的学习信号，以及组合学习的框架。这使得代理模型能够以更高的样本效率获得复杂的战略行为。通过构建具有明确、语言可配置任务层的环境，可以桥接低级反应式行为和高级战略团队配合。

Conclusion: 这种方法为训练下一代智能代理创造了一个强大且可通用的框架，通过层次架构和语言驱动的世界模型，有效解决了复杂多代理任务中的样本效率和学习效果问题。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WiA-LLM是一个新范式，通过整合假设分析(WIA)和强化学习，使大语言模型具备主动思考能力，能够在动态环境中预测行动后果，在王者荣耀游戏中达到74.2%的状态变化预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型只能被动处理信息，缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，这限制了它们在动态高风险场景（如战略规划、风险评估和实时决策）中的应用。

Method: 提出WiA-LLM范式，整合假设分析(WIA)方法，通过强化学习利用环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态而不仅仅是响应当前条件。在王者荣耀复杂多玩家游戏环境中进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示WiA-LLM在预测游戏状态变化方面达到74.2%的准确率（比基线提升高达两倍），在高难度场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索和整合假设分析能力到大语言模型的工作，代表了LLM主动推理的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前XRL方法可理解性有限、覆盖范围孤立的问题，弥复杂RL策略与领域专家之间的理解鸿沟。

Method: 采用五智能体LLM框架（协调器、解释器、编码器、评估器、调试器），自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，提供关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释。

Result: 在四重水箱过程控制问题上验证，成功高精度映射用户查询，编码器-调试器交互最小化反事实生成失败，定性评估确认有效解释智能体行为。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架有效提升了RL策略的可解释性，通过多智能体协作提供了更全面和可理解的解释能力。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Conclusion: 这是首次系统性地描述语言模型在长期合作行为中的特征，为未来研窆复杂人工智能社会环境中的模型行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Motivation: 自动化重复性任务、降低运营成本、提供24小时支持，通过克隆优秀人类销唠员的对话模式来提升AI助手的性能。

Method: 使用电话通话录音语料库，通过领域选择、知识提取和prompt工程构建AI代理，整合自动语音识别(ASR)、基于大语言模型的对话管理器和文本转语音(TTS)合成技术。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中专家智能体之间深度协作的语言交互瓶颈问题，现有工作在智能体选择和结果聚合方面已有进展，但高效的深度协作仍是一个关键挑战

Method: 引入协作知识模型(CKM)，使每个智能体能够动态感知协作伙伴的认知状态，通过实时认知差距分析自适应调整通信行为（内容焦点、细节层次、表达风格等）

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准测试中，OSC显著提高了任务性能和通信效率，将"并行工作的个体"转变为"深度协作的认知团队"

Conclusion: 该框架不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解，解决了深度协作的关键瓶颈

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser是一个新颖的端到端GUI解析框架，通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，显著提高了定位精度和解析能力，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM GUI感知方法存在两个主要问题：1）基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度低、推理速度慢；2）只能定位预定义元素集合，无法解析整个界面，限制了广泛应用和下游任务支持。

Method: 提出基于预训练MLLM的连续坐标建模方法，添加token路由器和坐标解码器；引入基于改进匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制来识别和拒绝不存在的元素；构建ScreenParse基准来系统评估GUI模型的结构感知能力。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-v2、CAGUI-Grounding和ScreenParse等多个基准测试中，该方法始终优于最先进的现有方法。

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，成功解决了现有MLLM GUI解析方法的局限性，实现了更高的定位精度、更快的推理速度和更细粒度的界面解析能力。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at
https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

TL;DR: DOVIS是一个五层协议，用于在AI代理生态系统中收集使用和性能数据，并实现AgentRank-UC算法来对AI代理进行动态排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的发展，需要一种机制来根据实际性能而非声明能力对代理进行排名，但当前缺乏全局透明的交互网络，使用信号分散且私有。

Method: 提出DOVIS五层协议（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义）收集隐私保护的使用和性能聚合数据，并实现AgentRank-UC算法结合使用频率和能力指标进行排名。

Result: 通过仿真验证了算法的收敛性、鲁棒性和抗Sybil攻击能力，证明了协调协议和性能感知排名的可行性。

Conclusion: DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法为实现可扩展、可信的AI代理网络提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

TL;DR: Sticker-TTS是一个新颖的测试时扩展框架，通过协调三个协作的大型推理模型，利用历史经验进行迭代探索和优化解决方案，在相同推理预算下超越了现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样，忽略了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。需要一种能够有效利用历史尝试信息的方法来提高推理性能。

Method: 提出Sticker-TTS框架，使用三个协作的LRM模型进行迭代推理，核心是提炼关键条件（称为sticker）来驱动跨多轮推理的关键信息提取、精炼和重用。采用两阶段优化策略结合模仿学习和自我改进。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试（AIME-24、AIME-25、OlymMATH）上，Sticker-TTS在可比推理预算下 consistently 超越了强基线方法，包括自一致性和先进的强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 贴纸引导的历史经验利用是有效的，该框架显著提高了大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Sticker-TTS.

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心理理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标，提供有针对性的反馈来促进多智能体系统中的亲社会行为，在任务成功率和完成时间上优于现有大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中智能体在追求独立目标时如何有效协助和协作的挑战，促进亲社会行为（即使与自身目标不完全一致也能惠及他人的行动）。

Method: ProToM系统：1）使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标；2）基于推断的目标分布，通过最大化期望效用来选择上下文敏感的反馈信息。在Doors、Keys和Gems以及Overcooked两个多智能体环境中进行测试。

Result: 现有大型语言和推理模型在提供既上下文相关又时机恰当的反馈方面表现不足，导致更高的通信开销和任务加速。ProToM提供有针对性的有用反馈，实现了更高的成功率、更短的任务完成时间，并持续获得人类用户的偏好。

Conclusion: ProToM通过心理理论指导的针对性反馈，有效促进了多智能体系统中的亲社会行为，在实用性和用户偏好方面均优于现有最先进的方法。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Conclusion: 该研究为ODRL提供了坚实的正式基础，支持政策评估和比较，特别是在数据共享场景中

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Conclusion: LatticeWorld提供了一个简单有效的3D世界生成框架，显著提升了虚拟环境创建的效率和真实性，具有重要的工业应用价值

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高阶连续Galerkin离散化方法，通过非线性稳定项和新的不变域保持技术来求解一般双曲问题，结合WENO重构和凸限制技术确保数值解保持在凸容许集内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统耗散稳定化方法无法保证有限元近似解的节点状态保持在凸容许集内，需要开发新的限制策略来确保不变域保持特性。

Method: 使用WENO重构的平滑度传感器确定人工粘性量，通过自适应约束节点状态与中间单元平均值的偏差，采用Bernstein多项式作为局部基函数，并利用为DG方法设计的凸限制技术。

Result: 在时间步长限制下证明了不变域保持特性，通过通量限制器可显著减弱时间步长限制，所有算法步骤可实现矩阵无关和硬件感知的实现。

Conclusion: 新方法有效结合了连续Galerkin和DG-WENO方案的优点，数值算例证明了基于单元的限制策略的有效性。

Abstract: We equip a high-order continuous Galerkin discretization of a general
hyperbolic problem with a nonlinear stabilization term and introduce a new
methodology for enforcing preservation of invariant domains. The amount of
shock-capturing artificial viscosity is determined by a smoothness sensor that
measures deviations from a weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO)
reconstruction. Since this kind of dissipative stabilization does not guarantee
that the nodal states of the finite element approximation stay in a convex
admissible set, we adaptively constrain deviations of these states from
intermediate cell averages. The representation of our scheme in terms of such
cell averages makes it possible to apply convex limiting techniques originally
designed for positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods.
Adapting these techniques to the continuous Galerkin setting and using
Bernstein polynomials as local basis functions, we prove the invariant domain
preservation property under a time step restriction that can be significantly
weakened by using a flux limiter for the auxiliary cell averages. The close
relationship to DG-WENO schemes is exploited and discussed. All algorithmic
steps can be implemented in a matrix-free and hardware-aware manner. The
effectiveness of the new element-based limiting strategy is illustrated by
numerical examples.

Motivation: 针对对流-扩散问题，传统离散化方法在边界层区域存在精度问题，需要开发新的迎风Petrov-Galerkin离散化方法来提高数值解的精度和稳定性。

Method: 使用连续线性元作为试验空间和特殊指数气泡测试空间，推导离散化矩阵的精确逆矩阵公式。提出带特殊缩放参数的二次气泡迎风方法，并将其扩展到二维对流扩散问题。

Result: 证明了在避免边界层的子域上，提出的离散化方法能够获得最优的L²和H¹收敛阶。一维情况下找到了离散化矩阵的精确逆矩阵公式。

Conclusion: 提出的二次气泡迎风Petrov-Galerkin方法为多维对流主导模型提供了新的高效离散化方法，通过在流线方向使用高效迎风离散化并结合正交方向的标准离散化，可获得最优收敛性能。

Abstract: We consider special upwinding Petrov-Galerkin discretizations for
convection-diffusion problems. For the one dimensional case with a standard
continuous linear element as the trial space and a special exponential bubble
test space, we prove that the Green function associated to the continuous
solution can generate the test space. In this case, we find a formula for the
exact inverse of the discretization matrix, that is used for establishing new
error estimates for other bubble upwinding Petrov-Galerkin discretizations. We
introduce a quadratic bubble upwinding method with a special scaling parameter
that provides optimal approximation order for the solution in the discrete
infinity norm. % while avoiding exponential test functions. Provided the linear
interpolant has standard approximation properties, we prove optimal
approximation estimates in $L^2$ and $H^1$ norms. The quadratic bubble method
is extended to a two dimensional convection diffusion problem. The proposed
discretization produces optimal $L^2$ and $H^1$ convergence orders on
subdomains that avoid the boundary layers. The tensor idea of using an
efficient upwinding Petrov-Galerkin discretization along each stream line
direction in combination with a standard discretizations for the orthogonal
direction(s) can lead to new and efficient discretization methods for
multidimensional convection dominated models.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) as
surrogates for solving the inverse acoustic scattering problem of recovering a
sound-soft obstacle from phaseless far-field measurements. We approximate the
forward maps from the obstacle to the far-field data using DNNs, and for
star-shaped domains in two and three dimensions, we establish the expression
rates for fully connected feedforward neural networks with the ReLU activation
for approximating the forward maps. The analysis is based on the weak
formulation of the direct problem, and can handle variable coefficients.
Numerically we validate the accuracy of the DNN surrogates of the forward maps,
and demonstrate the use of DNN surrogates in the Bayesian treatment of the
inverse obstacle scattering problem. Numerical experiments indicate that the
surrogates are effective in both two- and three-dimensional cases, and can
significantly speed up the exploration of the posterior distribution of the
shape parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Abstract: State estimation that combines observational data with mathematical models is
central to many applications and is commonly addressed through filtering
methods, such as ensemble Kalman filters. In this article, we examine the
signal-tracking performance of a continuous ensemble Kalman filtering under
fixed, randomised, and adaptively varying partial observations. Rigorous bounds
are established for the expected signal-tracking error relative to the
randomness of the observation operator. In addition, we propose a sequential
learning scheme that adaptively determines the dimension of a state subspace
sufficient to ensure bounded filtering error, by balancing observation
complexity with estimation accuracy. Beyond error control, the adaptive scheme
provides a systematic approach to identifying the appropriate size of the
filter-relevant subspace of the underlying dynamics.

Method: 引入轨迹感知框架，迭代构建降阶模型以消除离线与在线残差轨迹之间的不匹配，利用参数间的低秩结构和原始动力学描述

Result: 数值测试显示比DSA方法效率更高，比ROMSAD在效率和鲁棒性上有显著提升，对于参数化晶格问题在线仅需2-3次迭代即可快速收敛

Conclusion: 轨迹感知ROM预处理器有效解决了残差轨迹不匹配问题，为参数化辐射传输方程的多查询应用提供了高效稳健的求解方案

Abstract: The parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) arises in multi-query
applications, such as design optimization, inverse problems, and uncertainty
quantification, which require solving the RTE multiple times for various
parameters. Classical synthetic acceleration (SA) preconditioners are designed
based on low-order approximations of a kinetic correction equation, e.g., its
diffusion limit in diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Despite their
widespread success, these methods rely on empirical physical assumptions and do
not leverage low-rank structures across parameters of the parametric problem.
  To address these limitations, our previous work introduced a reduced-order
model (ROM) enhanced preconditioner called ROMSAD, which exploits low-rank
structures across parameters and the original kinetic description of the
correction equation. While ROMSAD improves overall efficiency compared with
DSA, its efficiency reduces after the first iteration, because the construction
of the underlying ROM ignores the preconditioner-dependence of the residual
trajectory, leading to a mismatch between the offline and online residual
trajectories.
  To overcome this issue, we introduce a trajectory-aware framework that
iteratively constructs ROMs to eliminate the mismatch between offline and
online residual trajectories. Numerical tests demonstrate superior efficiency
over DSA, and substantial gains in both efficiency and robustness over ROMSAD.
For a parametric lattice problem, trajectory-aware ROM preconditioners achieve
rapid convergence within only $2$-$3$ iterations online.

Method: 从粘性平衡律出发，推导PDF/CDF方程，提出基于数值或精确实现的采样估计器来近似未封闭项，建立统一框架。

Result: 未封闭项在消失粘度极限下保持非零（耗散异常），采样近似方法随样本数增加而收敛，在某些情况下可推导先验误差界。

Conclusion: 采样基估计方法能有效近似PDF/CDF方程中的未封闭项，保持概率密度函数的非负性，数值实验验证了方法的收敛性。

Abstract: Motivated by the statistical description of turbulence, we study statistical
conservation laws in the form of kinetic-type PDEs for joint probability
density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)
associated with solutions of scalar balance laws. Starting from viscous balance
laws, the resulting PDF/CDF equations involve unclosed conditional averages
arising in the viscous terms. We show that these terms exhibit a dissipative
anomaly: they remain non-negligible in the vanishing viscosity limit and are
essential to preserve the nonnegativity of evolving PDFs. To approximate these
PDF/CDF equations in a unified framework, we propose a novel sampling-based
estimator for the unclosed terms, constructed from numerical or exact
realizations of the underlying balance-law solutions. In certain cases, a
priori error bounds can be derived, demonstrating that the deviation between
the true and approximate CDFs is controlled by the estimation error of the
unclosed terms. Numerical experiments with analytically solvable test problems
confirm that the sampling-based approximation converges satisfactorily with the
number of samples.

Method: 基于无穷双重级数的分段处理，提出两种数值计算方法DIV1和DIV2，能够在设置错误控制参数后自动进行计算，无需预先确定截断范围。

Result: 通过详细推导，建立了两种方法的错误上界，确保了计算精度的可确定性，且计算时间相似。

Conclusion: 该研究为双重非中心beta分布的CDF计算提供了新的数值计算方法，解决了以前方法中缺少错误控制和自动化计算的问题。

Abstract: The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the doubly non-central beta
distribution can be expressed as an infinite double series. By truncating the
sum of this series, one can obtain an approximate value of the CDF. Although
numerous methods exist for calculating the non-central beta distribution, which
allow for the control of the truncation range and estimation of the
computational error, no such methods have been developed for the doubly
non-central beta distribution. In this paper, we propose two new numerical
computation methods based on the segmentation of the infinite double series,
termed DIV1 and DIV2. Both methods enable automated calculations once the error
control parameters are set; there is no need to predetermine the truncation
range, and their computational times are comparable. Following detailed
derivations, we have established the upper bounds of the errors for both
methods, thus ensuring the determinability of the precision.

Result: 发现FastSurfer显示出比传统流水线更高的变异性；批动生成的集成模型与未批动基线性能相似；数值变异性可产生数值模型家族，可用于大脑年龄回归等下游应用

Conclusion: 训练时的变异性不仅是需要关注的可复现性问题，更是一种可以利用的资源，能够提升模型稳健性并为神经成像领域开启新的应用可能

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) is rapidly advancing neuroimaging by achieving
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computation times. Yet the numerical
stability of DL models -- particularly during training -- remains
underexplored. While inference with DL is relatively stable, training
introduces additional variability primarily through iterative stochastic
optimization. We investigate this training-time variability using FastSurfer, a
CNN-based whole-brain segmentation pipeline. Controlled perturbations are
introduced via floating point perturbations and random seeds. We find that: (i)
FastSurfer exhibits higher variability compared to that of a traditional
neuroimaging pipeline, suggesting that DL inherits and is particularly
susceptible to sources of instability present in its predecessors; (ii)
ensembles generated with perturbations achieve performance similar to an
unperturbed baseline; and (iii) variability effectively produces ensembles of
numerical model families that can be repurposed for downstream applications. As
a proof of concept, we demonstrate that numerical ensembles can be used as a
data augmentation strategy for brain age regression. These findings position
training-time variability not only as a reproducibility concern but also as a
resource that can be harnessed to improve robustness and enable new
applications in neuroimaging.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical and numerical investigation of object
detection in a fluid governed by the three-dimensional evolutionary
Navier--Stokes equations. To solve this inverse problem, we assume that
interior velocity measurements are available only within a localized subregion
of the fluid domain. First, we present an identifiability result. We then
formulate the problem as a shape optimization task: to identify the obstacle,
we minimize a nonlinear least-squares criterion with a regularization term that
penalizes the perimeter of the obstacle to be identified. We prove the
existence and stability of a minimizer of the least-squares functional. To
recover the unknown obstacle, we present a non-iterative identification method
based on the topological derivative. The corresponding asymptotic expansion of
the least-squares functional is computed in a straightforward manner using a
penalty method. Finally, as a realistic application, we demonstrate the
robustness and effectiveness of the proposed non-iterative procedure through
numerical experiments using the INSTMCOTRHD ocean model, which incorporates
realistic Mediterranean bathymetry, stratification, and forcing conditions.
