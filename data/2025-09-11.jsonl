Methods: During\npretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that\nshare similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are\ndissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological\nsimilarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically\nmeaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific\naugmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a\nhybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.\nResults: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,\nfor multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for\nbinary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,\nPhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,\nunderscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization.

However, unexpectedly, we\nfind that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks\nsuch as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.\nThis phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly\nunlearnable examples?

Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse\nfeatures based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it\nintroduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn\ndiscriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that\nSCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%\non WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline\nmethod TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively\nmitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust\nand accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking."}

However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU\nmemory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.\nOffloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to\nalleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches\ntypically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch\nexperts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in\ninference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading\nlatency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system\nwith a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically\ndivided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot\nexperts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,\nthereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic\npredicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top\nsegments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is\nreduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each\nlayer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio).

At its core,\nArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale\nmodifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus\nensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change\ndetection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high\nfidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly\nreduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations\nfurther highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change\nannotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD\nmapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions.

At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a\nuniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a\nproblem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals\nthat is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is\nbound to occur.

It primarily due to fundamental limitations in\nexisting approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input\nmodality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally\nmisaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization\nprocess is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the\nreward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes\nthese barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the\nreward score as the model's probability of predicting a \"yes\" token, indicating\nthat the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific\ncriteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM\narchitectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model\nScaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context\nScaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,\ntext-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the\npersistent challenge of \"reward hacking\": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and\nmaintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance\nto hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly\nrelieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models."}

We propose a method that labels log data\nwithout manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of\nanomaly detection.

Evaluations on public and industry datasets show\nF1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third\nlayer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,\ntheir origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying\nkey services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of\nroot cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable\ninsights for mitigation.

Like\nhuman cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and\nskills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite\nadvances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --\nwithout relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic\nenvironments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The\nframework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high\nflexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world\nscenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose\nScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation\nbalance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation\nby restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards\nexploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving\nstrategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on\n27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will\nopen-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets\n-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of\nintelligent agents."}

However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection.

However, interpreting their\ndecisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of\nvideo data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation\ntechniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient\nrobustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual\nexplanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target\nmodel, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent\nDiffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework\ndesigned to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous\napproaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations\nby operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while\nproducing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional\nrefinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE\nacross three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac\nultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action\nrecognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving\nan increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.\nQualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful\nand temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the\ntarget model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the\ntrustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains."}

However, CTh forecasting is a\nchallenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral\ncortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific\npredictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian\nBridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional\nconditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at\nthe vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution\nincludes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),\nwhich combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate\ncortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous\napproaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as\ndemonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI\nand OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual\nfactual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for\nexploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development."}

Gruber", "Dirk Hovy"], "title": "Large Language Model Hacking: Quantifying the Hidden Risks of Using LLMs for Text Annotation", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research\nby enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and\ntext analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,\ncommon regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in\nreducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\n  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is\nunacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,\nanything can be presented as statistically significant."}

RL has achieved remarkable success\nin advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing\ncomplex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has\nemerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the\nrapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces\nfoundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in\nalgorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely\nto revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore\nstrategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence\n(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for\nreasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including\nfoundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream\napplications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly\nevolving area.
