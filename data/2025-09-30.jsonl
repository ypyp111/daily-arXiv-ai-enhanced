This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological\nchallenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies\nextrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might\nsuch generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence\nalong which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether\nthey satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop\nat similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar\nabsolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other\nmodel components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond\nto particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate\nthis framework, I analyze \"1-back attention heads\" (components attending to\nprevious tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,\n70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental\ntrajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is\nmore limited.

We\nmeasure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\\,d_k$. Within this\nframework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it\nempirically. We show that $D_K = \\Theta(m' \\log m' / d_{\\text{model}})$ is both\nnecessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit\nconstruction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This\nscaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head\nattention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.\nWhen embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\\text{model}}$) and the graph is a\npermutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >\nd_{\\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating\ninterference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows\nthat allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this\ninterference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled\nsingle-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance\nthreshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit\nof distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.\n  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention\ncapacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across\nheads."}

Building on\nthis, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in\nour environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain\nsignificantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning."}

The\nmethod transforms the global problem into a system of sub-problems coupled\nthrough Schur complements at the interfaces. A key challenge is that the Schur\ncomplement disrupts the matrix structure required for direct FFT-based\ninversion. To overcome this, we develop a FFT-based preconditioner to\naccelerate the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method for the interface\nsystem. The central innovation is a novel preconditioner based on the inverse\nof the block operator without the Schur complement, which can be applied\nefficiently using the FFT-based solver.

Such a framework is essential to systematically\ninvestigate the complex and nonlinear coupled dynamics of the FSI. Further,\nparameters that are not typically considered in PM models become critical, such\nas the vibration amplitude. This article addresses this gap by proposing\nFSI-relevant ``behavioral'' parameters, distinct from the structural parameters\nof the PM, but with a clear mapping provided to them. We use high-fidelity,\nstrongly coupled simulations to quantify the FSI between a novel configuration\nof laminar flow past a flat plate, equipped with a PM.

To\nmeasure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the\nMini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates\nwithin fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them\nusing standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without\nexternal data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each\none serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our\nexperiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller\nmodels outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables\nquantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and\nlast-speaker advantage.

To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method\nthat jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.\nReasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of\ndiscrete image and text tokens.

In this work, we created\ndozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive\npsychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is\nsolvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be\ninsufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions\nand asking them to report the resulting object after performing the\ntransformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by\ntesting 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best\nLLMs performed significantly above average human performance.

This study revisits the classical problem of kinetic energy\ninstability of pipe flow using contemporary computational methods. We focus on\nfinite domains to address the limitations of previous infinite pipe analyses.\nWe analyze two different cases by imposing homogeneous Dirichlet and periodic\nboundary conditions. Our investigation reveals that the critical Reynolds\nnumber for instability approaches values established by Joseph and Carmi\n$(1969)$ as the length of the pipe increases. Specifically, when homogeneous\nDirichlet boundary conditions are applied, the critical Reynolds number\nconverges monotonically to a value of $\\RE_c \\leq 81.62$. In contrast, for the\nperiodic case, the critical Reynolds number varies periodically with the length\nof the pipe, exhibiting local minima at $\\RE_c = 81.58$. We further\ncharacterize the shape of the perturbations by computing their magnitude and\nvorticity for several local minima and maxima associated with the periodic\nproblem. Focusing on the perturbations obtained by imposing the homogeneous\nDirichlet boundary conditions, we compute their temporal evolution. As\nexpected, the $L^2$-norm of the perturbation decreases from the initial time\nwhen solving for the critical Reynolds number, while it initially increases and\nthen eventually decreases for Reynolds numbers exceeding the critical value."}

First, a\nhierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data\nfoundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0\nmodel. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model\nDeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are\ninput into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical\ndiffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal\nfeature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a\nContrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust\nfew-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0\nachieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent\nat the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a\nsubstantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training\nsamples.

To cover diverse patterns\nof query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a\nsimulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:\nIncremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing\nqueries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their\nsearch goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,\no4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents\nachieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and\n60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is\nsubstantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build\nagents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR\ndomain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to\nguide future agent development."}

Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which\nconflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase\nstructure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows\ncategory detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking\ndata from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their\ntemporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze\ntransitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,\nsuggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize\nscanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was\nthe strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical\nfamiliarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated\nthat syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to\n-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend\ncurrent models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure\nconstruction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,\nsupporting a predictive \"tree-scaffolding\" account of comprehension."}

However, the full\npotential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,\nwhich typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a\nnovel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return\ndistribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow\nmatching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible\ntransformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target\ndistribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based\npolicy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable\nand informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,\nespecially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in\nboth offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods."}

Our Novel\ndistillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning\nboth global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained\nXMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and\nevaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis\ntasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within\n1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold\nprocessing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our\ncross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we\ndeveloped an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's\nperformance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish\ncross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM\ncapabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially\nenabling real-time pathology AI integration."}

We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and\nNVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and\nreal-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods\nstruggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably\nneutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two\nscale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the\nclassic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to\nFP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and\nformat-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of\nhigh-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible\noverhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of\nthe activations.

Recent approaches\ntrain large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online\nRL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our\nexperimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a\ncontinue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,\nwe identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own\nstochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly\nresembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a\nvicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we\nintroduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed\nICRL (CV-ICRL).

Recently,\nfinetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred\nchoice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former\nachieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to\ncommon biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical\nconcerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this\npaper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of\nthese judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges\nfinetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by\nfuture models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well\njudges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three\naspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and\ntest distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three\ndifferent base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging\nfor most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with\nDPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that\ncontinual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older\nand newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker\nresponses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance\ndegradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,\nshowing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions.

This\npaper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI\nsystems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm\ncalled Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection\nlayer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events\ncorresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to\ndynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally\nmodels the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the\nframework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time."}

The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the\npaired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.\nExtensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber\nconsistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k\nperformance.

This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake\nscenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader\nAI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such\ncontent becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the\nintegrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a\nphysically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that\ndefocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a\ndepth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured\nimages due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images\noften lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these\ndiscrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative\nfeature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or\nfrequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging\nprinciples and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and\ngeneralizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature\nanalyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a\nreliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images.

We address\nthis gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes\nmultimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are\ndistributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional\nmodalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient\nreasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts\nperformance.

Our method offers significant improvements,\nreducing average generation length by 66\\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in\nend-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without\ncompromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden\nstates to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of\nhidden states for efficient reasoning.

This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic\ncomplexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.\nIntuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict\nattention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.\nSuch approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and\nclearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity\nbehaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in\neach head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising\nsteps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention\nmethods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to\ncapture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in\nearly denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel\nsparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only\nrequires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them\nacross all steps.

To address the challenge of missing\ndata, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework\nthat uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting\non the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there\nis no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process\nsusceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy.

Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple\nlinear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant\ndeeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of\nlinear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of\ncharacteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free\nsetting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and\nexplain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel\nindependence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the\nnoisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads\nto the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence\nof noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need\nfor structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two\ncomplementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank\nreduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank\nReduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel\nadaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a\nnoise-suppressing null space during training.

To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution\nTracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic\nprobability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference\nclusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,\nPET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling\ntransparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET\nimproves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.\nOn a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at\nranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model\nby 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model\nfrom direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional\npreference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse\npersonalization systems."}

With the introduction of various movable\nobjects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify\nobjects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of\ndifferent sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects\nand the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.\nWe first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.\nThen, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact\nregions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping\nand manipulation of diverse objects.

However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only\ncapture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two\nkey limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag\ninteractions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among\nindustries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series\nforecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by\neliminating these limitations.

This module incorporates a sliding\nwindow and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider\nlead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model\nmulti-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message\npassing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the\nconsistency of each scale.

Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text\nencoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on\nmitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we\nobserve that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial\nskewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space.

To\nfinetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained\ndebiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness\nwithout auxiliary references.

In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs\nefficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel\nmiddle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps\nextracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect\nfine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.\nBased on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain\nboth globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the\n1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial\nlayout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and\nretain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local\nretaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the\nmost important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our\nproposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of\nLLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and\nimprove the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without\nsacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.\nCompared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher\ninference efficiency."}

While post-training quantization (PTQ) has\nsuccessfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without\nsignificant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)\nremains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on\nultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals\nthat multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them\nexhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text\ntokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the\nactivation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over\ndifferent layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation\ndistributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better\ntolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a\nnovel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit\nQuantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers\nthat are more resilient to it.

However, such aggressive compression leads to\nsignificant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training\nwith massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large\nnumber of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because\nthese weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable\nescape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.\nTo address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization\noptimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing\nthem as dynamic biases.

We answer this question through\ncontrolled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that\nsubliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.\nInstead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where\nteachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out\nthese tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,\ndivergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,\nfinetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal\nlearning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small\nchanges, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it."}

We find that attention weights can be separated into two\nparts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining\nweights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse\nacceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based\non this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable\nattention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion\nmodels. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and\nnegligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)\nattention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these\ncomputations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward\npasses. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x\nreduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration\nwithout loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention\ncomputation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,\noutperforming baseline methods.

In Submission", "summary": "Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to\nforecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential\nequations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science\nand engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system\nparameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen\nout-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is\nof great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on\ndiscovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics\ntrajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains\ndeficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are\nstill required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE\ndynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we\nfirst explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out\nthat ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant\nacross different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this\ntwo-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method\ntermed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert\narchitecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive\nexperiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate\niMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization\ncapabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios."}

The models are divided into several\nexperts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter\nvalues. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW\noptimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on\nthe tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current\nexpert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert\nwould help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight\nof the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the\nsame accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the\nmodel for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the\ntraining needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments\nshow that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times!

This study develops an efficient 3D\ndeep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from\npre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified\nflow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and\nT2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient\nlatent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained\nin this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a\ncurated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),\nmeningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.\nSelected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test\n(N=614) sets.

T1C-RFlow\nachieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-\n0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-\n0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082.

Five LLMs are evaluated as\nannotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3\n70B Instruct.

For\ncross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with\nonly 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher\naccuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art\nperformance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating\nplanning from execution.

Such\nvariability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many\nalignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage\nKantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,\nbut rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order\ntemporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a\nself-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused\nPartial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,\nour formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations\nunder a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant\nframes, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional\nvideos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with\ninter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple\nregularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions.

This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in\nLLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with\nRL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue\nthat RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.\nThis work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills\nduring RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms\nby which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination\nand other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task\ncomplexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.\nSpecifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string\ntransformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g\nprior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen\ncompositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability\ngeneralizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions\nunseen during RL training.

We address\nthis gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes\nmultimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are\ndistributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional\nmodalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient\nreasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts\nperformance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker\nmodalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward\ncertain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be\nintegrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:\ntask-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly\nexecuted in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces\nbias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode\nfact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)\nrestores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck.

Therefore, the way in\nwhich PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is\nstill unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of\nsequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root\nvelocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations.

In this paper, we show that this\ntrade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates\nbetween compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically\nadjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase\ncuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable\ndecisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens\nand increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length\nlimit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon\nsettings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the\nmodel's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily\npushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency\ntrade-off.

In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening\nobjective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent\nto minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.\nAccordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the\nacceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose\nobjective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow\nstraightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low\ncomplexity.

Even the more concerned diffusion models\nneed to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is\ndifficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,\nself-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of\ngeneralizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other\ndoses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of\ntunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data\nfor low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata\nsimilarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the\nLDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent\nprogress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge\ndistillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing\nimage details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and\nthe pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained\nreconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the\ninitial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is\nflexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen\ndoses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,\nSuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.\nFull qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data\nshow that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods\nin terms of reconstruction and generalization performance."}

But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where\nthe student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how\ndoes subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through\ncontrolled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that\nsubliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.\nInstead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where\nteachers with different biases would predict different tokens.

As we show in this work, this \"inner\" flow matching model can be\nretrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the\nefficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale\ntext-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between\nstochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS\nFlows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making\nit a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion\nmodels."}

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting\nslightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting\nlatency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,\nresulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can\nboost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically\nby 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct."}

Yet public\ndatasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting\nthe development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple\nhead-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce\nAQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental\nQuality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,\ntotal volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture\nfacility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every\nfive minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000\ntime-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly\narchived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting\nheight, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source\nprocessing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and\nexports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions\n(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time\npeaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,\nand sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture\ninformatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine\nlearning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space\ndynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems."}

To bridge this gap, we propose\nMeta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework\nthat dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a\nlightweight meta-learner, as an \"alignment gap estimator\", to evaluate the\npotential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data.

However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical\nconcerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this\npaper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of\nthese judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges\nfinetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by\nfuture models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well\njudges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three\naspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and\ntest distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three\ndifferent base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging\nfor most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with\nDPO-trained models consistently improving performance.

Most existing methods either couple different parts of the\ndiffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for\ncorrection. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory\nperformance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text\nencoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on\nmitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we\nobserve that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial\nskewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More\nimportantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To\nfinetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained\ndebiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness\nwithout auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the\noriginal generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage\ntext-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder\nintervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and\nefficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA\ndebiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in\nsampling burden.

To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a\ngeneral framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging\na deeply compressed latent space.

Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;\nhowever, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image\nprocessing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness\non complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a\nnovel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual\nreasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a\nreasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity\nprocessing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a\ngrounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with\ntraditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this\nfoundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic\nthree-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.\nMoreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical\nimages, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively\nrevisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and\ndynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion.

Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,\nwe identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.\nBuilding on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two\ncommunity-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying\nmechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold\nselection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same\nlevel of impact.

Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number\nnumerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a\nchallenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints\nsuch as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state\nfeedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL\nagent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%\nvibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While\nthis level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance\nachieved using high-frequency rotary actuation.

InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that\nseamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2\nreuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture\nmodification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence\nprocessing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all\nsequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly\ntransitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical\nacceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2\nthat significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on\nlong-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that\nInfLLM-V2 is 4$\\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and\n99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we\nhave trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1\n(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,\nproviding a reproducible implementation for the research community."}

Our method outperforms previous methods both\nqualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control\ninputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of\ngenerations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image\nand temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that\nconditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation\nmodels for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for\nusage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,\nthe first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different\nmediums."}

Starting from a tabula rasa state\nwith no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of\ninteraction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete\ntrajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where\nit refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and\nPlaybook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable\nstrategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,\nMinesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent\nsuccessfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their\nrules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies\nconfirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work\ndemonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only\nact effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world\nthrough explicit reasoning on raw experience."}

This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with\nfixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering\nmodel-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce\nGHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method\ndesigned to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce\nhallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or\nprior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to\nmislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a\ndiffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking\nimages. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original\ninput, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to\nhallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including\nreasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success\nrate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery\nmethods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and\nobject-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST\nuncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce\nhallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on\nour images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and\ncorrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems."}

Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting\na model's \"self-knowledge\", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its\nown answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some\nprivileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the\nmodel itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict\nthe correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an\nunrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a\n\"Correctness Model\" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical\npredictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness\ninformation, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that\nGCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns\nfor correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use\nCMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its\ngeneralization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that\nanswer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore\nalternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that\nincluding history as in-context examples can help improve correctness\nprediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in\ncalibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families\nand the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective\nprediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a\ngeneralizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding\ncorrectness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on\nself-introspection."}

While previous research accelerates\ndiffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy\nwithin the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a\ngeneral framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging\na deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch\napproach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the\nquality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the\nrepresentation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply\ncompressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct\nfine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with\na lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are\naligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base\nmodel's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA\nand FLUX.1-Krea.
