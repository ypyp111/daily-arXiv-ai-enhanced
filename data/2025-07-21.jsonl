Although such\nsystems usually have turbulent flows and the bubbles are typically much larger\nthan the particles, there currently exist no predictive models for this case\nwhich consistently include finite-size effects in the interaction with the\nbubbles as well as inertial effects for the particles simultaneously. As a\nfirst step, Jiang and Krug (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 1006, 2025, A19) proposed a\nfrozen turbulence approach which captures the collision rate between\nfinite-size bubbles and inertial particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence\nusing the bubble slip velocity probability density function measured from\nsimulations as an input. In this study, we further develop this approach into a\nmodel where the bubble-particle collision rate can be predicted a priori based\non the bubble, particle, and turbulence properties. By comparing the predicted\ncollision rate with simulations of bubbles with Stokes numbers of 2.8 and 6.3,\nand particles with Stokes numbers ranging from 0.01 to 2 in turbulence with a\nTaylor Reynolds number of 64, good agreement is found between model and\nsimulations for Froude number $Fr \\leq 0.25$. Beyond this range of bubble\nStokes number, we propose a criterion for using our model and discuss the\nmodel's validity. Evaluating our model at typical flotation parameters\nindicates that particle inertia effects are usually important. Generally,\nsmaller bubbles, larger particles, and stronger turbulence increase the overall\ncollision rate."}

The non-linear coupling between the\ncontact lens and the eye is achieved assuming the the suction pressure under\nthe lens is applied directly to the ocular surface, neglecting the post-lens\ntear film layer. The contact lens dynamics is modeled using a previous\npublished model. We consider a homogeneous and a heterogeneous linear elastic\neye model, different ocular shapes, different lens shapes and lens thickness\nprofiles, and extract lens deformation, lens suction pressure profiles, and\nocular deformations and stresses for all the scenarios considered. The model\npredicts higher ocular deformations and stresses at the center of the eye and\nin the limbal/scleral region.

The ocular displacements\nand stresses increase non-linearly as we increase the stiffness of the contact\nlens. Inserting a steeper contact lens on the eye results in a reduction of the\nocular displacement at the center of the eye and a larger displacement at the\nedge of the contact lens.

While existing Temporal Graph Neural\nNetworks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex\narchitectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer\nfrom scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.\nIn this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates\nshort-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns.

To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without\nresorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an\nencoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed\npoint. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes\nthe input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix\ninternally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This\nadaptivity yields up to 20\\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without\nincreasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test\ntime offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.\nSelf-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative\nreasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures."}

As conversation\nhistories become longer, existing large language models face increasing\ncomputational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide\nefficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either\ncompress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on\nfixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and\nunpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,\nwe present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework\nfor large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two\nmain innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the\nprefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the\nattention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value\ncompression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient\ncache based on the most recently generated output tokens.

It establishes a framework for\nintegrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted\nanalysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,\nseveral LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the\nquality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different\nNDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.\nEach LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed\ndescriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and\ndemonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine\nmodels provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of\ntopics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models\nare summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of\nthe bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more\neffective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to\nsignificantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an\ninnovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and\nsummarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and\nenhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments."}

While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry).

The study focuses on two model\narchitectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an\ninherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach\nis evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge.

However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon."}

Key architectural elements and techniques, such\nas the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the\nmodel's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,\nenabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is\nrevealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without\ndrastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational\nrequirements.

Running a Transformer\nautoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,\nmore recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback\nloops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in\nsubsequent steps. While this \"thinking aloud\" mirrors human reasoning,\nbiological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as\nlanguage. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without\nresorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an\nencoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed\npoint. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes\nthe input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix\ninternally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This\nadaptivity yields up to 20\\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without\nincreasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test\ntime offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.\nSelf-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative\nreasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures."}

However, it often relies on\npre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing\nconflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as\nmore flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for\ncomplicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL\n(Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL\nframework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across\nthe entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our\nmethod constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given\npreferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this\nreward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive\nexperiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task,\nand an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method\nperforms competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground\ntruth reward function.

We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid\nadaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to\ninvestigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual\nlearning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating\nconcurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to\nmodulate synaptic plasticity.

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated\noptimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU\nefficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources."}

In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs.

Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2).
