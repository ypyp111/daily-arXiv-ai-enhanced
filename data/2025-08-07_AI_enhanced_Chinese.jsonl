We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that\nrepresentational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased\nthan the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated\nprompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these\nbiases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be\nsufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental\nchanges in model development.

Much attention has been paid recently to placing particles\nin fast oscillatory flow fields, usually driven by microbubbles actuated by\nlow-frequency ultrasound, where particle inertia leads to deterministic\ndisplacements. However, such devices invariably set up simultaneous streaming\nflows that are interpretable as driven Stokes flows. The potential role of\nthese flows in not just passively transporting but likewise manipulating the\nparticles has not been appreciated. Therefore, we investigate whether a Stokes\nflow by itself can meaningfully affect the displacement of a single particle or\na rigid dumbbell, given the properties and symmetries of the flow. To\nmanipulate a single particle, its hydrodynamic interaction with a nearby\nboundary is crucial for obtaining non-trivial results. To irreversibly displace\na particle using this effect, we find that the flow symmetry must be broken in\nspecified ways.

To address\nthis gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural\nchatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing\npersonalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and\nspeech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined\nthrough fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated\ndatasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi\nSathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect\nthe necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood\nbefore generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the\nsystem performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching\ninformation from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored\nresponse using the IFT model.

However,\ndespite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to\nmechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are\nparticularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are\nmeasured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to\nenhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion\nfactor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the\nconversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter\n(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly\nestimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The\nexperimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.\nTests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show\nthat measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were\nreduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few\nknown reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement\nof all parts within the camera's field of view.

Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even\nwith the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs\nknowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/Linuxin-xxx/LKS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLatent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u8f91\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cbe\u786e\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u7f16\u8f91\u5927\u91cf\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u64cd\u7eb5\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama-2\u548cMistral\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLKS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f16\u8f91\u591a\u8fbe10,000\u6761\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LKS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

The flow conditions were set at a Mach number of 0.85, Reynolds number\nof 2.27 $\\times$ 10$^6$, and angle of attack of 4.82$^{\\circ}$. Buffet cells\nare cellular patterns with spanwise periodicity that propagate toward the wing\ntip, with nondimensional frequencies (Strouhal numbers) of 0.2--0.6, higher\nthan those of shock oscillations associated with transonic buffet. However, the\nphysical mechanisms driving buffet cells and their interaction with\nlow-frequency shock motion are not fully understood. This study employs\nvariational mode decomposition-based nonstationary coherent structure (VMD-NCS)\nanalysis applied to unsteady pressure-sensitive paint measurement data. The\nresults reveal that the amplitude of buffet cells is not directly coupled to\nthe low-frequency shock-wave oscillations but instead shows correlation with\nthe boundary layer separation state. Strong buffet cell fluctuations persist in\nregions of sustained separation (midspan), while their amplitude varies with\nlocal separation/reattachment dynamics in regions of intermittent separation\n(outboard).

We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark\nconsisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics\n- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major\nexaminations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,\nthis benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures\nessential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models\nfor the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.\nGPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's\nhighest average accuracy being 38.15%.

Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset\nof texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the\nLLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including\nperforming post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and\ntrustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,\nstate-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation\ncost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a\nsingle response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context\ntraceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a\nprompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques\ndesigned to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical\ninsights for our design choice.

Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by\noptimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and\nproviding an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing\nstudies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline\ndatasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that\nlimit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge.

To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy.

We consider a system where a Rayleigh-B\\'enard instability\nis triggered by a temperature difference between the top and bottom boundaries.\nHeterogeneity is represented by multi-Gaussian log-normally distributed\npermeability fields. We explore the effect of the Rayleigh number, the variance\nand correlation length of the log-permeability field on the fingering patterns,\nheat flux, mixing state and flow structure. Heat flux increases for all\nheterogeneous cases compared to the homogeneous ones. When heterogeneity is\nweak and the horizontal correlation length small, flux exhibits minimal\nsensitivity to the variance of the log-permeability. When the correlation\nlength increases, flux increases proportionally to the log-permeability\nvariance. The mixing state is evaluated through the temperature variance and\nthe intensity of segregation. Both take higher values, compared to their\nhomogeneous analogues, when the correlation length and the variance of the\npermeability are increased. This indicates that even if heat flux increases,\nthe system is less well mixed. The flow structure shows that in homogeneous and\nweakly heterogeneous cases there is a relation between the location of high\nstrain rate and stagnation point, while for strongly heterogeneous cases, high\nstrain rate zones are linked to high permeability areas near the boundaries,\nwhere temperature plume originate.

To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective\npolicy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative\nTrajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens\nappearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,\nprotects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To\nfurther prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy\nexceeds a provable threshold.

In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical\nresults demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus\nallowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from\nagent-based simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u5f62\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6f14\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5fae\u89c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5efa\u6a21\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6865\u6881\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4ece\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b8f\u89c2\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528LSTM\u548cMVAR\u5b66\u4e60\u964d\u9636\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b4) \u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u5d4c\u5165->\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60->\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u73af\u5883\u7a7a\u95f4\u201d\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u3002"}}

We measure the results according to\nthree performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard\nindex, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff\ndistance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of\n65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields\n40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and\n(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDINOv2\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u6e90\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u5c04\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5efa\u7b51\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u667a\u80fd\u57ce\u5e02\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u3001LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u6e90\u5730\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u4eba\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5c04\u9891\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8665.3%\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2IoU\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0840.1%\uff09\u3001\u7eaf\u5c04\u9891\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0837.3%\uff09\u548c\u975eAI\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0842.2%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5c04\u9891\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u73af\u5883\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u57ce\u5e02\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, social interactions have two key\ncharacteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,\nwhere utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit\nassignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as\nrapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal\nachievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL\nwith single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines\ncoarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.\nUtterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by\nattributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards\ncapture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.\nExperiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate\nthat Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17\non Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing\napproaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level\ncredit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training.

The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems\nfrom the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog\nrepresentations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring\nrobustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized\n(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image\ntransmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding\n(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic\nfeature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete\nlatent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission\ninstead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we\ndevelop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically\noptimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during\ntraining process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a\nuniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to\nstabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook\nupdates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase\nshift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard.

Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience.

This hybrid approach allows the\nagent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management\nand data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.\nWe evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1\nachieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly\noutperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves\nefficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to\njust 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that\nintegrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and\nscalable path toward generalized computer automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoAct-1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408GUI\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u7f16\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafGUI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CoAct-1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed9GUI\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u6216\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u652f\u6301Python/Bash\u811a\u672c\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728OSWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCoAct-1\u6210\u529f\u738760.76%\uff0c\u6b65\u9aa4\u6570\u964d\u81f310.15\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafGUI\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u52a8\u4f5c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging\nand often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or\nstaff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has\nemerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,\nreal-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential\nby comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting\ncrowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and\ncounting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification\nvia a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic\nsegmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly\nefficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the\ngenerated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,\nfor passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving\ndataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit\nAuthority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our\nresults demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive\nvalue for crowd estimation.

While effective in low-dimensional settings,\nBO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large\nnumber of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP\nmodels. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can\nmodel complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO\napproaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model\nuncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally\nintensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these\nlimitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox\noptimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty\nestimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for\nexploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region\nto ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization\nproblems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four\nstate-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in\nbandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved\nsimultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit\nalgorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas\nfairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes\ninequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound\n(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures\n$\\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,\nmatching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is\nsufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential\nprivacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time\nhorizon.

To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a\nmulti-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and\nobjective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety.

(2) Dual-Objective\nOptimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility\nAgent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning\nto evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their\noptimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that\nHarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up\nto 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance\nacross all tasks.

Extensive experiments on\n8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering\nclear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.\nAblation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as\na promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.\nOur codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZARA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u6d3b\u52a8\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "ZARA\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3001\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u4ee3\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2aHAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cZARA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672cSOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5f97\u5206\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad82.53\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ZARA\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine\nlearning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions\nalong with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation\nperformance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists\ntumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the\nspecific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained\nsegmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable\ncombinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the\npolicy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next\nstep, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best\nlocalised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled\nmultiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its\npotential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,\nespecially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show\nthat our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more\ninterestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal\nstrategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist\nguidelines such as PI-RADS.

However, existing methods\nrely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific\ntraining videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes\nin the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training\nparadigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but\nnoisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for\npretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video\nalignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated\nhigh-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the\nrequired human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each\nframe to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window\nattention.

However,\ncurrent RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently\nretrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be\nresolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk\nretrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information\nsignals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAIRS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u65e0\u5173\u6587\u6863\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "PAIRS\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPAIRS\u51cf\u5c1125%\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u53471.1% EM\u548c1.0% F1\u3002", "conclusion": "PAIRS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While RAG\nmethods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation\nmodels, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge\nunderexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with\ngeneralization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and\nmodel-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID\ndynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach\nutilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with\ncategory-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further\nintegrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the\nquery, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID\ngenerates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images\nfrom a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched\ninput for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo).

Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,\nSimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching\nchallenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn\nfeedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the\ncreation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real\nnovice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as\nextroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.\nCompared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate\ncomparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the\nprocess as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own\nprofessional insight.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies.

To address these\ndeficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model\n(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an\nactive reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM\nprovides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,\nevaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More\ncritically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first\nerroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new\ntest-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework\nactively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to\nguide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby\nimproving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool.

However, this task\nis severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and\nhigh inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete\nground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its\nvariant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key\nmodules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures\nsemantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract\nunbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

However, its application to the downstream Image-Text\nRetrieval (ITR) task is more challenging.

To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning\nwith Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning\nframework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically\nadjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the\nperformance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,\nDCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained\nrepresentation learning.

A particular challenge arises in\nscenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as\nthese parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since\nparked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information\nobtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately\nreflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.\nTo address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization\nframework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud\n(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image\nsegmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and\nsubsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise\nspatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road\nenvironments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian\ndetection and contributes to improved road safety.

However, existing\nbenchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and\nincomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first\ncomprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world\nhuman-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically\ndiverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential\nreasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6\nwell-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended\ncounting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction\npipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task\nselection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large\nmultimodal models, and structured question generation.

However, achieving this\ngoal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective\nstrategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses\nthese challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically\ndesigned to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a\ncomprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language\nmodels (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this\nend, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark\ncomprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240\nsentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this\nbenchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot\nlearning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel\ninsights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,\nthe current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when\nfine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\\% F1.\nSecond, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,\nsome lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent\nperformance.

It is widely recognized that incorrect\nangle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity\nmeasurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for\nautomated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human\ncarotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models\nwere used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a\ncustom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation.

While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong\ngeneralization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging\nanalysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge\nthis gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction\ntechniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single\nmodality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality\nmisalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this\npaper, we propose \\textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\\underline{N}teracted qu\\underline{E}ry\n\\underline{A}daptation with o\\underline{R}thogona\\underline{L} Regularization),\na novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two\ncontributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which\ndynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between\nmodalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal\nmedical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA\nintroduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from\nUSEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the\nincremental knowledge.

This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing\nthe epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that\ncharacterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

The client\nsecurely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,\nensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise\ninput privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:\nPrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy\nattacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,\nwhich leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and\nprevent query-based inversion generalization.

It\nhighlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the\nsignificant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,\nespecially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research\nintroduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1\nMathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's\nGPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain\nframework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official\ncurriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching\nplan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess\nthe generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic\nTextual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified\nthrough a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method.

Most\nexisting pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing\nsimilar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm\ninevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain\nforgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it\nstruggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when\nthe weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting\nin the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA\nFusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with\nin-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,\nwhich dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains\nthrough learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task\nvector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the\norientation of the task vectors.

GAT outperforms existing\nVideo TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large\nlanguage models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses\nthe previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\\% in accuracy and\nachieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/zhangyan-ucas/GAT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGAT\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5bfc\u5411\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6536\u96c6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6355\u6349\u6587\u672c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "GAT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53473.86%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u5341\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "GAT\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled\nexperiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies\nunder the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via\nKL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that\nTM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work\npaves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future.

The results\nshow that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the\ndisclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of\nanother attribute?", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67905000\u591a\u4e2a\u8eab\u4efd\u76d7\u7a83\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4eba\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u8bba\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u67d0\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u53e6\u4e00\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However,\nenabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major\nchallenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are\nparticularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal\ncontinual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal\nfeature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and\nzero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and\nsystematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by\nidentifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.\nBased on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to\ntheir target problems: (1) \\textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address\ncross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)\n\\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during\nupdates; and (3) \\textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter\ninterference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current\nevaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better\nbenchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional\ngeneralization.

However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations\nand the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the\nrelative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most\nexisting stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax\neffectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image\nstitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on\nthe novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry\ngrounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene\nreconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto\na designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving\npixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to\nfurther address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial\nstitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the\nrefined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large\nparallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric\nintegrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct\napplicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM.

This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of\ntraining data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which\nconsists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs\nwith certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we\nfind that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage\ntheir training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during\ntraining. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often\nincorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand\nthis issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,\nrevealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling\n(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and\nlightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via\ntraining bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between\nground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias\nand adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only\nupdates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach.

Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired\nnew research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be\ndirectly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its\ntext-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the\nmask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its\nutility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core\ncomponents: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a\ncontext sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models\nthe spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a\nstructured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.\nMeanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying\nand leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing\nrich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a\nnew large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named\nVehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations\nacross diverse scenes and viewpoints.

Recent\nadvancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained\nVision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct\nFine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,\nremains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a\nperformance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex\nmitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is\nflawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further\ninvestigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting\nprimarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than\nfrom degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we\npropose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates\nstrategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned\nclassifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers.

Existing representations in robotics and\ncomputer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural\nregularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made\nenvironments. This paper introduces \\textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal\nrepresentation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly\naccommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to\ndecouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared\nvanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled\nnormal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding\nof structural regularities.

In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the\navailability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.\nSelf-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of\nunlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,\nthat can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich\nfeature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training\neffort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we\ninvestigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The\nmitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an\nindependent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor\ngrading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on\nmultiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen\ntumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt\nthe models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms.

Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR\nmodel. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal\ncharacteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we\npropose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a\nspatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the\ncalibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each\nlayer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the\nlow-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine\nthe FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,\nwe propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased\nquantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model\nand significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action\nsegmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder\nthat keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the\nembedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into\nnon-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion\nwords, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters.

Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the\nmodel to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are\nstreaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient\nto store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain\nlong-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an\nevent-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals\nthat model event-level information with various durations. To preserve\nhistorically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event\nmemory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent\nand long-term information.

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance\non exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability\nto handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality\nin real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments\nworn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically\nrestricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{OMFA} (\\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for\nboth virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition\ngarments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing\ngarments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target\nperson (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel\nposes-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built\nupon a novel \\emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise\nand denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,\nthe person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient\nbidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely\nmask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,\nmaking it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging\nSMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose\ntry-on from just one image.

While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural\ngrounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,\ncompositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual\npatterns.

To address this limitation, we propose\nANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under\nsuch perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by\nfusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered\nto form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt\ntokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper\nlayers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware\nvisual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype\n(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder.

Experiments show that our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal\ninconsistency by 29%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-Occ\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e3D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5e27\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b3D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faST-Occ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u83b7\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cST-Occ\u57283D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd53 mIoU\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c1129%\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-Occ\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}
