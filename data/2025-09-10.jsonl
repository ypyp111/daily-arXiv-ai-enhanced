By integrating PeTTO with\nphase field methods, the partial differential equations (PDEs) constrained\noptimization problem in topology optimization is transformed into a set of time\ndependent PDEs, which can be analyzed using the knowledge of transient physics.\nThe sensitivities with respect to the design variable are calculated with the\nautomatic differentiation which help avoid tedious and error-prone manual\nderivations. The overall system of equations is efficiently solved using a\nhybrid of the pseudo-transient method and the accelerated pseudo-transient\nmethod, balancing the convergence rate and numerical stability. A variety of\nnumerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the proposed PeTTO approach. These examples cover different\nphysics scenarios including mechanical and thermal problems, as well as\nsingle-material and multi-materials cases in both 2D and 3D.

Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the\ntoken-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize\nadversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.\nExperimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,\nachieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%\nimprovement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen\ntask scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between\nactivations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of\nsemantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation."}

The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the\npolicy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from\nits diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:\nusing the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,\nDiversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences\n(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By\ncontinuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to\nmaintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL\ngeneration demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but\nimproves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is\nmore training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator\nfunctions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online\nreference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving\nRLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a\npowerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models."}

In this work, to trade off predictability and\nnon-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (\nNSATP), is proposed.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable\nguidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into\nclassifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques."}

In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking\npaths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems."}

We systematically evaluated SLMs on\nhealth prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning\napproaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices\nto evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical\nhealthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance\ncomparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.\nHowever, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and\nfew-shot scenarios.

Retraining LLMs is not a\ncost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying\nparameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple\nknowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the\nissue of \"edit skipping\", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in\ninference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of\nknowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity\nof LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing\nmethod with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single\nedited facts and entire edited cases.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings.

These successes have been\ndriven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.\nHowever, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force\ntrial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible.

To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth\nsegmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for\npretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)\nmodalities.

Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\ninternal and external testing, with an increase of 12\\% for CBCT segmentation\nand 8\\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).\nFurthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth\ngroups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging\nconditions and clinical scenarios."}

While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,\nthese metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This\npaper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX\n4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by\nsystem-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To\novercome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive\nInference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no\narchitectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference\nstrategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit\nand resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs\nwithin a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution\npass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection\nconfidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x\nspeedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.\nThis work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying\nhigh-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus\nfrom pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that\nmaximize throughput."}

Project Page: https://mini-o3.github.io/", "summary": "Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools\nwith reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing\nopen-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow\nonly a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for\ndifficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking\npaths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems."}
