This study aims to generalize the mechanisms of partial coalescence across a range of drop shapes, elucidate the underlying mechanism of neck oscillations, and examine the roles of inertial, viscous and gravitational forces, quantified by the Weber, Ohnesorge, and Bond numbers, in governing the coalescence behavior. A phase diagram is constructed to delineate the boundaries between partial and complete coalescence regimes based on these dimensionless parameters. Our analysis of the height-to-neck ratio shows that, upon contact with the pool, the primary drop forms an upward liquid column that ultimately pinches off due to inwardly directed horizontal momentum. Additionally, the study suggests that as the dimensionless numbers increase, the effect of the vertical collapse rate plays a significant role in the outcome of the coalescence process. Notably, the Rayleigh-Plateau instability is found to be insignificant in driving partial coalescence within the explored parameter space. We identified a transition regime between partial and complete coalescence, characterized by multiple neck oscillations that delay the pinch-off of secondary droplets. The formation of secondary droplets is most prominent for prolate drops, followed by spherical and oblate drops of comparable volume. Furthermore, we observe that the tendency to form multiple droplets from elongated liquid columns diminishes with an increase in the impact velocity of the primary drop."}

For diatomic gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method commonly employs the Borgnakke-Larsen (BL) model to simulate translational-rotational energy exchange (relaxation) processes. Although widely used, the BL model lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation and assumes that only a fraction of collisions lead to rotational relaxation. To address these shortcomings, Pullin introduced a kinetically consistent relaxation model into the gas kinetic theory. By employing the Beta function for energy partitioning, a concrete collision cross section that satisfies the detailed balance condition is constructed. In this study, a comparative investigation of the BL and Pullin models is performed within the DSMC framework, where both original and simplified equations are considered and parameterized by physical accommodated coefficient in the Beta function. A series of test cases--including zero-dimensional rotational relaxation of nitrogen, one-dimensional planar Couette flow and normal shock wave, two-dimensional hypersonic flow past a cylinder, and three-dimensional hypersonic flow around an X38-like vehicle--are performed to assess the accuracy and efficiency of these models. The results confirm the consistency between the Pullin and BL models. Owing to its rigorous theoretical foundation and accurate physical representation, the Pullin model is expected to provide substantial support for the extension of subsequent theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Moreover, in the highly rarefied flow regime (Knudsen number greater than 1, or altitudes above 100 km), the simplified Pullin model exhibits performance comparable to that of the BL model."}

Nevertheless, important open questions remain: in under-resolved regimes, which filter is most suitable for a given stabilization or closure model? Moreover, once a filter is selected, how should its parameters, such as the filter radius, be determined? Addressing these questions is essential for the reliable design and performance of filter-based stabilization strategies. To answer these questions, we propose a novel strategy that differs fundamentally from current filter-based approaches: we replace traditional spatial filters with a data-driven stabilization operator (StabOp) that yields accurate results for a given resolution, quantity of interest, and stabilization strategy. Although the new StabOp can be used for both classical discretizations and ROMs, and for different types of filter-based stabilization or closure, for clarity we focus on ROMs and the Leray stabilization. To build the new StabOp, we postulate its model form as a linear, quadratic, or nonlinear mapping, and then solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem to minimize a given loss function. Using the resulting StabOp in the Leray ROM (L-ROM) yields a new stabilized ROM, StabOp-L-ROM. To assess the StabOp-L-ROM, we compare it with the L-ROM and the standard ROM in numerical simulations of four flows: 2D flow past a cylinder at Re=500, lid-driven cavity at Re=10000, 3D flow past a hemisphere at Re=2200, and minimal channel flow at Re=5000. Our numerical results show that the StabOp-L-ROM can be orders of magnitude more accurate than the classical L-ROM tuned with an optimal filter radius in the predictive regime. Furthermore, while the new StabOp smooths the input flow fields, its smoothing mechanism differs from that of classical spatial filters."}

In a nutshell, the algorithms iteratively compute a basis matrix, in one of the two particular forms, for the eigenspace of some matrix pencil associated with its eigenvalues in certain complex region such as the left-half plane or the open unit disk, and their success critically depends on that the interested eigenspace do have a basis matrix taking one of the two particular forms. However, that requirement in general cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, a new doubling algorithm, called the $Q$-doubling algorithm, is proposed.

This work presents the development of a three-dimensional two-temperature Gas-Kinetic Scheme (3D 2T-GKS) on unstructured meshes. The scheme resolves translational-rotational and vibrational energy modes within a unified kinetic framework. A key innovation is the integration of a Generalized Kinetic Boundary Condition (GKBC), which physically decouples the thermal accommodation of vibrational energy from the translational-rotational mode, thereby offering a more accurate model for gas-surface interactions. Additionally, a Discontinuity Feedback Factor (DFF) is employed to capture strong shock waves with reduced numerical dissipation compared to classical limiters. The method is rigorously validated against standard experimental benchmarks, including the sharp double-cone and hollow cylinder-flare configurations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solver, augmented by the GKBC, accurately captures complex wave structures, separation topologies, and surface heat flux distributions. These findings confirm the robustness and fidelity of the 3D 2T-GKS for simulating complex hypersonic non-equilibrium flows."}

We implement a greedy approach for this problem, whose computational efficiency we improve using rank-one updates via the Sherman-Morrison formula. We additionally present an iterative algorithm that, for each feasible allocation of sensors, greedily optimizes over each sensor fidelity subject to previous sensor choices, repeating this process until a termination criterion is satisfied. To the best of our knowledge, these algorithms are novel in the context of cost constrained multifidelity sensor placement. We evaluate our methods on several benchmark state estimation problems, including reconstructions of sea surface temperature and flow around a cylinder, and empirically demonstrate improved performance over random designs."}

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities."}

We investigate a fundamental question, does visual rendering truly decouple a model from tokenization constraints? Focusing on four Indonesian low-resource local languages that have their own non-Latin scripts (i.e., Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, and Lampungnese), we evaluate the impact of script-tokenizer alignment within the DualGPT architecture. Our results show that, despite visual rendering, reintegrating a text tokenizer into the architecture reintroduces the same issue that pixel-based language modeling aims to resolve, which is the tokenizer misalignment problem. Despite having lower OOV and fertility rates, we show that the Llama 2 tokenizer performs significantly worse than a custom tokenizer, with improvements of up to 30.15 chrF++. Our findings serve as a warning for future multimodal variants, as text tokenizers remain a significant barrier to equitable models."}

By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis."}

These properties create two practical tensions. First, dense FFNs spend the same compute on every token regardless of context, and they allocate capacity uniformly even when language exhibits highly clustered context structure. Second, continual learning, in the sense of updating the model while serving a data stream, often produces interference because a small update touches broadly shared weights.\n  We propose Attractor Patch Networks (APN), a plug-compatible replacement for the Transformer FFN. APN is a bank of patch experts. A similarity router selects a small top-k set of patches for each token by matching the token representation to learned prototypes. Each selected patch emits a low-rank residual update conditioned on a compact code. The architecture yields conditional, context-specialized nonlinear transformations while preserving the standard Transformer interface.\n  This paper focuses on APN as an architectural primitive. We formalize APN, analyze its expressivity as a piecewise low-rank residual function class, and derive simple interference and stability arguments that make APN naturally compatible with continual learning. In experiments on character-level language modeling, APN achieves competitive perplexity (4.57 vs 4.32 PPL) while enabling dramatically better continual adaptation: when adapting to a shifted domain, APN achieves 2.6 times better retention (11.1 vs 29.4 PPL on the original domain) and 2.8 times better adaptation (6.4 vs 17.8 PPL on the new domain) compared to global fine-tuning of a dense FFN baseline."}

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability."}

With the rapid development of data-driven approaches, many data-driven turbulence models have been proposed, yet they still suffer from issues of generalizability and accuracy. In this work, we propose a few-shot, physically restorable, symbolic regression turbulence model based on the normalized general effective-viscosity hypothesis. Few-shot indicates that our model is trained on limited flow configurations spanning only a narrow subset of turbulent flow physics, yet can still outperform the baseline model in substantially different turbulent flows. Physically restorable means our model can nearly revert to the baseline model in regimes satisfying specific physical conditions, using only the symbolic regression training results. The normalized general effective-viscosity hypothesis was proposed in our previous study. Specifically, we first formalize the concept of few-shot data-driven turbulence models.

In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

Departing from data-intensive finetuning, we investigate the paradigm of Inference-time Language Acquisition (ILA), where an LLM masters an unfamiliar language through dynamic interaction with limited external resources. In this paper, we propose ILA-agent, a general ILA framework that equips LLMs with a set of behavioral primitives. By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment. To provide a rigorous evaluation in a low-resource setting, we construct Cangjie-bench, a multi-task benchmark based on the novel statically-typed language Cangjie. We instantiate ILA-agent for Cangjie and evaluate its performance across code generation, translation, and program repair tasks. Results using diverse LLMs demonstrate that ILA-agent significantly outperforms retrieval-augmented baselines. Further analysis of agent trajectories characterizes the emergent behavior patterns while highlighting persisting performance gaps."}

The power-to-liquid process for the production of CO2-neutral jet fuel via electricity, called e-SAF, directly replaces fossil jet fuel without having to change infrastructure, aeroplanes, or jet-engines. The process combines green hydrogen with industrial exhaust gas, or captured carbon dioxide, in a circular economy concept. A key element of the e-SAF production plant is the reactor where syngas is produced. Traditional reactors use catalytic technology, which faces severe challenges due to the reduced performance over time because of catalyst degradation, clogging, and breakup due to embrittlement. A high-potential alternative is the catalyst-free reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reactor concept.\n  The primary aim of this paper is to investigate the fundamental aspects of the catalyst-free RWGS process, such as reaction kinetics and the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. The secondary aim is to identify how a typical combustion subgrid scale models for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) perform when the chemical reactions are endothermic, in contrast to the strong endothermicity associated with classical combustion.\n  It is found that even small traces of O2 in the CO2 stream can significantly increase the production rate of CO. This is attributed to the increased pool of OH. The effect is strongest at atmospheric pressure and less pronounced at higher pressure. By using the temporal jet framework to study turbulence-chemistry interactions, an algebraic equation for the prediction of the CO conversion time in a turbulent flow as a function of Damkohler number and chemical timescale is employed. Finally, it is concluded that the PaSR LES subgrid model designed for combustion reactions perform well also for the endothermic reverse water-gas-shift reaction."}

It is well known that the normalized tangent plane method is able to simultaneously achieve the non-convex manifold constraint and original energy dissipation. However, the associated computational cost of this numerical approach is exceedingly high. By contrast, the projection method is more straightforward to implement, while it often compromises the inherent energy dissipative property of the continuous model, and the error analysis turns out to be even more challenging. In this work, we first construct a linear and fully discrete finite difference numerical scheme, based on the projection method for the LLG equation, which is capable of simultaneously preserving the non-convex manifold constraint \\(|\\mathbf{m}| = 1\\) and an unconditional original energy dissipation. In the error analysis, the classical theoretical technique becomes ineffective, due to the presence of the nonlinear Laplacian term, which in turn poses a significant challenge. To overcome this subtle difficulty, we carefully rewrite the numerical method in an equivalent weak form, in which a point-wise length preserving feature of the numerical solution plays an essential role. As a result of these estimates in the reformulated weak form, an optimal convergence rate could be theoretically established. In our knowledge, this numerical method is the first linear algorithm that preserves the following combined theoretical properties: (i) point-wise length preservation, (ii) unconditional original energy dissipation, (iii) a theoretical justification of convergence analysis and optimal rate error estimate."}

Generative AI has shown promise in increasing data volume and enhancing model training, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) domains. However, generating physiological time-series data, a common type in medical AI applications, presents unique challenges due to its inherent complexity and variability. This paper introduces TransConv-DDPM, an enhanced generative AI method for biomechanical and physiological time-series data generation. The model employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with U-Net, multi-scale convolution modules, and a transformer layer to capture both global and local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TransConv-DDPM on three diverse datasets, generating both long and short-sequence time-series data. Quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, TimeGAN and Diffusion-TS, using four performance metrics, demonstrated promising results, particularly on the SmartFallMM and EEG datasets, where it effectively captured the more gradual temporal change patterns between data points. Additionally, a utility test on the SmartFallMM dataset revealed that adding synthetic fall data generated by TransConv-DDPM improved predictive model performance, showing a 13.64% improvement in F1-score and a 14.93% increase in overall accuracy compared to the baseline model trained solely on fall data from the SmartFallMM dataset. These findings highlight the potential of TransConv-DDPM to generate high-quality synthetic data for real-world applications."}

J. (2025). Hydroacoustic Absorption and Amplification by Turbulence, arXiv:2512.07920], the present work conducts a more in-depth investigation into the impact of turbulence on hydroacoustic waves. The study includes the influences of temperature, unsteady laminar flow, standing wave effects, the alteration of phase, the variation of amplification factor with frequency, and the temporal evolution of the acoustic wave. Experiments indicate that the temperature rise caused by friction between the turbulent flow and the pipe wall does not significantly affect the acoustic wave, and therefore is not the primary cause of changes in wave amplitude. When two transducers are placed opposite each other, the acoustic waves can be regarded as a superposition of traveling waves and standing waves. When the pump is shut down after the pipe flow has stabilized, the temporal evolution of the acoustic waves during the subsequent turbulence decay process can be classified into six types. In addition to altering the amplitude, turbulence also changes the phase of waves. The total phase shift of the acoustic wave along the entire pipe equals the sum of the phase shifts in each segment. Both the amplification factor and the phase shift due to turbulence vary periodically with frequency. Experiments for low-frequency waves show that acoustic waves with frequencies below a certain threshold are not affected by turbulence. These findings suggest that the interaction between hydroacoustic waves and turbulence constitutes stimulated emission in water."}

In this paper, given existing skeletonized TT approximations, we propose a family of projection enhanced interpolation based algorithms to further improve approximation accuracy while keeping low computational complexity. We do this as a postprocessing step to existing interpolative decompositions, via oversampling data not in skeletons to include more information and selecting subsets of pivots for faster projections. We illustrate the performances of our proposed methods with extensive numerical experiments. These include up to 10D synthetic datasets such as tensors generated from kernel functions, and tensors constructed from Maxwellian distribution functions that arise in kinetic theory.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

Treating all terms of the linearized and discretized governing equations implicit in velocity, pressure and/or the components of the polymer stress tensor, a tightly coupled system of equations is obtained. The interface separating the interacting bulk phases and the surface tension acting at the fluid interface are modelled using a state-of-the-art front-tracking method. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed numerical framework with four representative test cases, including the deformation of a viscoelastic droplet in shear flow at large Weissenberg numbers of up to Wi=10^4, and the jump discontinuity of the rise velocity of a bubble rising in a viscoelastic liquid as a result of a \"negative wake\".

Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing subnetwork from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? To further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free and relies solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that require external knowledge while being more efficient. Our findings suggest that diverse human-like behaviors are not merely induced in LLMs, but are already embedded in their parameter space, pointing toward a new perspective on controllable and interpretable personalization in large language models."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce Vectra, to the best of our knowledge, the first reference-free, MLLM-driven visual quality assessment framework for e-commerce IIMT. Vectra comprises three components: (1) Vectra Score, a multidimensional quality metric system that decomposes visual quality into 14 interpretable dimensions, with spatially-aware Defect Area Ratio (DAR) quantification to reduce annotation ambiguity; (2) Vectra Dataset, constructed from 1.1M real-world product images via diversity-aware sampling, comprising a 2K benchmark for system evaluation, 30K reasoning-based annotations for instruction tuning, and 3.5K expert-labeled preferences for alignment and evaluation; and (3) Vectra Model, a 4B-parameter MLLM that generates both quantitative scores and diagnostic reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Vectra achieves state-of-the-art correlation with human rankings, and our model outperforms leading MLLMs, including GPT-5 and Gemini-3, in scoring performance. The dataset and model will be released upon acceptance."}

Key results on 1 million synthetic maze pairs include:\n  - 192x reduction in training loss over 100 epochs\n  - 22.7x improvement in L2 distance to ground truth\n  - Only 10 Euler steps required (vs. 100-1000 for typical diffusion models)\n  Quantitative analysis reveals a striking phase transition phenomenon: the solution remains invisible for 68% of the transformation (zero recall), then emerges abruptly at t=0.70 within just 2% of the process. Most remarkably, 100% of samples exhibit simultaneous emergence across all spatial regions, ruling out sequential path construction and providing evidence for holistic rather than algorithmic reasoning.

In this work, we introduce PreFlect, a prospective reflection mechanism that shifts the paradigm from post hoc correction to pre-execution foresight by criticizing and refining agent plans before execution. To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation. Evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that PreFlect significantly improves overall agent utility on complex real-world tasks, outperforming strong reflection-based baselines and several more complex agent architectures.

This paper presents Open TutorAI, an open-source educational platform based on LLMs and generative technologies that provides dynamic, personalized tutoring. The system integrates natural language processing with customizable 3D avatars to enable multimodal learner interaction.

This assistant is accessible via both text-based and avatar-driven interfaces. The platform includes tools for organizing content, providing embedded feedback, and offering dedicated interfaces for learners, educators, and parents. This work focuses on learner-facing components, delivering a tool for adaptive support that responds to individual learner profiles without requiring technical expertise. Its assistant-generation pipeline and avatar integration enhance engagement and emotional presence, creating a more humanized, immersive learning environment.

In this work, we report a data-driven discovery that motivates a reinterpretation of this classical view. We consider the linear convection equation discretized using an unstable FTCS scheme augmented with a learnable artificial viscosity. Using automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization, the viscosity field is inferred by minimizing the error with respect to the exact solution, without imposing any sign constraints. The optimized viscosity consistently becomes locally negative near extrema, while the numerical solution remains stable and nearly exact. This behavior is not readily explained within classical modified equation analysis and Lax-Wendroff-type arguments, which predict a strictly positive effective viscosity. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we reinterpret artificial viscosity as a space-time closure that compensates unresolved truncation errors while enforcing entropy stability through global dissipation balance rather than pointwise positivity. Within this framework, the Lax-Wendroff scheme corresponds to a degenerate projection in which temporal truncation errors are eliminated and reintroduced as spatial diffusion. We show that entropy stability constrains the integrated dissipation budget rather than the pointwise sign of spatial viscosity. As a result, locally negative viscosity naturally emerges as a numerical reconvolution operator that compensates for dispersive truncation errors. Negative viscosity is therefore not an unphysical diffusion process, but a scheme- and grid-dependent correction mechanism."}

This paper investigates the application of Gaussian-constrained representations inspired by LeJEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) to address these challenges. We present three progressively refined pipelines, culminating in a LeJEPA-inspired approach that enforces isotropic Gaussian constraints on learned image embeddings. Rather than introducing new theoretical guarantees, our work empirically evaluates how these constraints influence clustering consistency and pose estimation robustness in practice. Experimental results on IMC2025 demonstrate that Gaussian-constrained embeddings can improve scene separation and pose plausibility compared to heuristic-driven baselines, particularly in visually ambiguous settings.

By \"surgically\" replacing specific projections (Query, Key, Value, Gate, Up) with HDPL operators while retaining standard dense layers for aggregation (Output, Down), we achieve a superior balance of efficiency and representational power.

In the deposited mode of the melting process, the time required for the frozen droplet to melt completely is much shorter than that in the floating mode. Force analysis shows that the melted fluid flows along the gas-liquid interface toward the top of the melting droplet, thereby exerting force and then suppressing the upward movement of the unmelted ice layer. Moreover, the flow within the liquid film formed between the unmelted ice layer and the heating wall is dominated by the viscous force, which has a lubrication effect and maintains the deposition of the unmelted ice layer. High heating temperature, large contact angle, and low particle concentration are helpful for the occurrence of the deposited mode."}

To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead.

As the Reynolds number increases, two distinct transitions are observed: the first corresponds to the destabilization of a periodic orbit, while the second marks the saturation of the large-scale motions. When expressed in terms of the forcing Reynolds number, these transitions occur at nearly the same value for all forcing wavenumbers, suggesting a universal scaling with respect to the forcing scale. By filtering the data to retain only the large-scale range ($k < k_f$), we show that the dimensionality estimated by the autoencoders also saturates at the second transition, implying that once the large scales are fully developed, the subsequent increase in dynamical activity occurs predominantly at smaller scales. At higher Reynolds numbers, the Kaplan-Yorke dimension ceases to grow, revealing its limited sensitivity to the nonlinear interactions that dominate in this regime. Both the Kaplan-Yorke saturation dimension and the filtered large-scale dimensionalities exhibit a linear dependence on $k_f$, indicating that the number of active degrees of freedom scales with the forcing scale rather than with the total number of available Fourier modes."}

Specifically, we train a conditional diffusion model to learn the distribution of DtN data and to infer full measurement vectors given partial observations. Our approach supports flexible source receiver configurations and can be used as a plug in preprocessing step with off the shelf EIT solvers. Under mild assumptions on the polygon conductivity class, we derive nonasymptotic end to end bounds on the distributional discrepancy between the completed and ground truth DtN measurements. In numerical experiments, we couple the proposed diffusion completion procedure with a deep learning based inverse solver and compare its performance against the same solver with full measurement data. The results show that diffusion completion enables reconstructions comparable to the full data baseline while using only 1% of the measurements. In contrast, standard baselines such as matrix completion require 30% of the measurements to achieve similar reconstruction quality."}

Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments. This synthesis bridges algorithmic alignment and institutional oversight design, highlighting how game-theoretic deterrence can make AI oversight proactive, risk-aware, and resilient to manipulation."}

In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation on how to enable directional multi-talker speech understanding capabilities for LLMs, specifically in smart glasses usecase. We propose two novel approaches to integrate directivity into LLMs: (1) a cascaded system that leverages a source separation front-end module, and (2) an end-to-end system that utilizes serialized output training. All of the approaches utilize a multi-microphone array embedded in smart glasses to optimize directivity interpretation and processing in a streaming manner.

Existing bird strike prevention strategies primarily rely on avian radar systems that detect and track birds in real time. A major limitation of these systems is their inability to identify bird species, an essential factor, as different species exhibit distinct flight behaviors, and altitudinal preference. To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds."}

In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Driven Framework for Non-Rigid Medical Image Registration (AD-RegNet) that employs attention mechanisms to guide the registration process. Our approach combines a 3D UNet backbone with bidirectional cross-attention, which establishes correspondences between moving and fixed images at multiple scales. We introduce a regional adaptive attention mechanism that focuses on anatomically relevant structures, along with a multi-resolution deformation field synthesis approach for accurate alignment. The method is evaluated on two distinct datasets: DIRLab for thoracic 4D CT scans and IXI for brain MRI scans, demonstrating its versatility across different anatomical structures and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods on the IXI and DIRLab datasets. The proposed method maintains a favorable balance between registration accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical applications. A comprehensive evaluation using normalized cross-correlation (NCC), mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity (SSIM), Jacobian determinant, and target registration error (TRE) indicates that attention-guided registration improves alignment accuracy while ensuring anatomically plausible deformations."}

While interpolation from parent-to-child during refinement in continuous Galerkin (CG) discretizations is naturally conservative, the standard injection-based child-to-parent coarsening interpolation is generally not.\n  We propose a simple, scalable field-conserving coarsening operator for parallel, octree-based AMR. The method enforces discrete global conservation during coarsening by first computing field conserving coarse-element values at quadrature points and then recovering coarse nodal degrees of freedom via an $L^2$ projection (mass-matrix solve), which simultaneously controls the $L_2$ error. We evaluate the approach on mass-conserving phase-field models, including the Cahn--Hilliard and Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes systems, and compare against injection in terms of conservation error, solution quality, and computational cost."}

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone.

We propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework that quantifies hallucinations through the presence of risk-bearing language, including treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-risk medications. Rather than assessing clinical correctness, our approach evaluates the potential impact of hallucinated content if acted upon. We further combine risk scoring with a relevance measure to identify high-risk, low-grounding failures. We apply this framework to three instruction-tuned language models using controlled patient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behavior exhibit substantially different risk profiles and that standard evaluation metrics fail to capture these distinctions. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating risk sensitivity into hallucination evaluation and suggest that evaluation validity is critically dependent on task and prompt design."}

We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue).

This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop.

Users often employ follow-up questions to refine their intent, expecting LLMs to adapt dynamically. However, recent research reveals that LLMs suffer a substantial performance drop in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn interactions with fully specified instructions, a phenomenon termed ``Lost in Conversation'' (LiC). While this prior work attributes LiC to model unreliability, we argue that the root cause lies in an intent alignment gap rather than intrinsic capability deficits. In this paper, we first demonstrate that LiC is not a failure of model capability but rather a breakdown in interaction between users and LLMs. We theoretically show that scaling model size or improving training alone cannot resolve this gap, as it arises from structural ambiguity in conversational context rather than representational limitations. To address this, we propose to decouple intent understanding from task execution through a Mediator-Assistant architecture. By utilizing an experience-driven Mediator to explicate user inputs into explicit, well-structured instructions based on historical interaction patterns, our approach effectively bridges the gap between vague user intent and model interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly mitigates performance degradation in multi-turn conversations across diverse LLMs."}

In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs."}

In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%.

We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks."}

In Banach spaces, continuity of point-evaluation functionals alone is insufficient to guarantee feature representations or kernel-based learning formulations. In this work, we develop a functional-analytic framework for learning in Banach spaces based on the notion of featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces. We identify the precise structural conditions under which feature maps, kernel constructions, and representer-type results can be recovered beyond the Hilbertian regime.

Directed transport and energy advection are treated by method-of-characteristics integration, yielding explicit directional sweeps defined by characteristic maps and inflow data. Scattering is incorporated through a fixed-point (source-iteration) scheme in which the angular gain is lagged, yielding a sequence of decoupled directional solves coupled only through angular sums.\n  The method is formulated variationally in a transport graph space adapted to the charged particle drift. Under standard monotonicity and positivity assumptions on the stopping power and boundedness assumptions on cross sections, we establish coercivity and boundedness of the transport bilinear form, prove contraction of the source iteration under a subcriticality condition and derive a rigorous a posteriori bound for the iteration error, providing an efficient stopping criterion.\n  We further analyse an elastic discrete-ordinates approximation, including conservation properties and a decomposition of angular error into quadrature, cone truncation and finite iteration effects. Numerical experiments for proton transport validate the characteristic sweep against an exact ballistic benchmark and demonstrate the predicted fixed-point convergence under forward-peaked scattering. Carbon-ion simulations with tabulated stopping powers and a reduced multi-species coupling illustrate Bragg peak localisation and distal tail formation driven by secondary charged fragments."}

We compare Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as adaptive methods against a non-adaptive baseline method for selecting example type in a logic ITS. Our experiment with 113 students demonstrates that both adaptive policies significantly improved student performance on test problems. BKT yielded the largest improvement in posttest scores for low prior knowledge students, helping them catch up with their high prior knowledge peers, whereas DRL yielded significantly higher posttest scores among high prior knowledge students. This paper contributes new insights into the complex interactions of cognitive engagement and adaptivity and their results on learning outcomes."}

In many applications, the parameters being tuned come with a carefully engineered default configuration, and practitioners only want to deviate from this default when necessary. Standard BO, however, does not aim to minimize deviation from the default and, in practice, often pushes weakly relevant parameters to the boundary of the search space. This makes it difficult to distinguish between important and spurious changes and increases the burden of vetting recommendations when the optimization objective omits relevant operational considerations. We introduce BONSAI, a default-aware BO policy that prunes low-impact deviations from a default configuration while explicitly controlling the loss in acquisition value. BONSAI is compatible with a variety of acquisition functions, including expected improvement and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We theoretically bound the regret incurred by BONSAI, showing that, under certain conditions, it enjoys the same no-regret property as vanilla GP-UCB. Across many real-world applications, we empirically find that BONSAI substantially reduces the number of non-default parameters in recommended configurations while maintaining competitive optimization performance, with little effect on wall time."}

Heuristic pruning methods are efficient but sensitive to activation outliers, while reconstruction-based approaches improve fidelity at the cost of heavy computation. In this work, we propose a lightweight post-training pruning framework based on first-order statistical properties of model weights and activations. During pruning, channel-wise statistics are used to calibrate magnitude-based importance scores, reducing bias from activation-dominated channels. After pruning, we apply an analytic energy compensation to correct distributional distortions caused by weight removal. Both steps operate without retraining, gradients, or second-order information. Experiments across multiple LLM families, sparsity patterns, and evaluation tasks show that the proposed approach improves pruning performance while maintaining computational cost comparable to heuristic methods. The results suggest that simple statistical corrections can be effective for post-training pruning of LLMs."}

We illustrate that deep learning quickly becomes weakly convex after a short period of training, and the loss is predicable by an upper bound on the last iterate, which further informs the scaling of optimal learning rate.

While space-time TT solvers have demonstrated significant potential for compressed high-dimensional simulations, the literature contains few systematic comparisons with classical time-stepping methods, limited error convergence analyses, and little quantitative assessment of the impact of TT rounding on numerical accuracy. Likewise, existing studies fail to demonstrate performance across a diverse set of PDEs and parameter ranges. In practice, monolithic Newton iterations may stagnate or fail to converge in strongly nonlinear, stiff, or advection-dominated regimes, where poor initial guesses and severely ill-conditioned space-time Jacobians hinder robust convergence. We overcome this limitation by introducing a coarse-to-fine multilevel strategy fully embedded within the TT format. Each level refines both spatial and temporal resolutions while transferring the TT solution through low-rank prolongation operators, providing robust initializations for successive Newton solves. Residuals, Jacobians, and transfer operators are represented directly in TT and solved with the adaptive-rank DMRG algorithm. Numerical experiments for a selection of nonlinear PDEs including Fisher-KPP, viscous Burgers, sine-Gordon, and KdV cover diffusive, convective, and dispersive dynamics, demonstrating that the multilevel TT approach consistently converges where single-level space-time Newton iterations fail. In dynamic, advection-dominated (nonlinear) scenarios, multilevel TT surpasses single-level TT, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, specifically when high-fidelity numerical simulation is required."}

In Stage I, prompts from DICES are reclassified into 14 safety domains (adapted from BEAVERTAILS) using Mistral 7B-Instruct-v0.3, retaining demographic metadata and expanding low-resource domains via Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with SimHash-based deduplication, yielding 43,050 samples.

Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope. While these practices increase evaluation cost, they are essential for distinguishing genuine scientific progress from statistical noise."}

We present a novel unsupervised semi-parametric framework COMBOOD for OOD detection with respect to image recognition. Our framework combines signals from two distance metrics, nearest-neighbor and Mahalanobis, to derive a confidence score for an inference point to be out-of-distribution. The former provides a non-parametric approach to OOD detection. The latter provides a parametric, simple, yet effective method for detecting OOD data points, especially, in the far OOD scenario, where the inference point is far apart from the training data set in the embedding space. However, its performance is not satisfactory in the near OOD scenarios that arise in practical situations. Our COMBOOD framework combines the two signals in a semi-parametric setting to provide a confidence score that is accurate both for the near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. We show experimental results with the COMBOOD framework for different types of feature extraction strategies. We demonstrate experimentally that COMBOOD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on the OpenOOD (both version 1 and most recent version 1.5) benchmark datasets (for both far-OOD and near-OOD) as well as on the documents dataset in terms of accuracy. On a majority of the benchmark datasets, the improvements in accuracy resulting from the COMBOOD framework are statistically significant. COMBOOD scales linearly with the size of the embedding space, making it ideal for many real-life applications."}

Theoretical and empirical analyses show that, unlike naive pooling or uniform subsampling, matching achieves better results under asymmetric meta-distributions, which are also extended to non-Gaussian and multimodal real-world settings. Most importantly, we show that these improvements translate to zero-shot medical anomaly detection, one of the extreme forms of data heterogeneity and asymmetry.

We propose NAAMSE, an evolutionary framework that reframes agent security evaluation as a feedback-driven optimization problem. Our system employs a single autonomous agent that orchestrates a lifecycle of genetic prompt mutation, hierarchical corpus exploration, and asymmetric behavioral scoring. By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes. We show that this adaptive approach provides a more realistic and scalable assessment of agent robustness in the face of evolving threats.

We ask a concrete question: when the generation paradigm is changed but the agent framework and supervision are held fixed, do diffusion backbones induce systematically different planning and tool-use behaviors, and do these differences translate into end-to-end efficiency gains? We study this in a controlled setting by instantiating DLLM and AR backbones within the same agent workflow (DeepDiver) and performing matched agent-oriented fine-tuning on the same trajectory data, yielding diffusion-backed DLLM Agents and directly comparable AR agents. Across benchmarks and case studies, we find that, at comparable accuracy, DLLM Agents are on average over 30% faster end to end than AR agents, with some cases exceeding 8x speedup. Conditioned on correct task completion, DLLM Agents also require fewer interaction rounds and tool invocations, consistent with higher planner hit rates that converge earlier to a correct action path with less backtracking. We further identify two practical considerations for deploying diffusion backbones in tool-using agents. First, naive DLLM policies are more prone to structured tool-call failures, necessitating stronger tool-call-specific training to emit valid schemas and arguments. Second, for multi-turn inputs interleaving context and action spans, diffusion-style span corruption requires aligned attention masking to avoid spurious context-action information flow; without such alignment, performance degrades. Finally, we analyze attention dynamics across workflow stages and observe paradigm-specific coordination patterns, suggesting stronger global planning signals in diffusion-backed agents."}

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans."}

Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications.

This lack of distributional diversity severely restricts the exploration efficiency required for subsequent RL. While recent studies have attempted to improve SFT by replacing the CE loss, aiming to preserve diversity or refine the update policy, they fail to adequately balance diversity and accuracy, thereby yielding suboptimal performance after RL.

ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split.

Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance. Compared with the original DMN, the rotation-free Interaction-based Material Network (IMN) formulation achieves a 3.4x - 4.7x speed-up in offline training, while maintaining comparable online prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions."}

As a result, existing risk-sensitive model-free approaches are limited to simple tasks and tabular settings. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical justification for policy gradient methods on the entropic risk measure, including on- and off-policy gradient theorems for the stochastic and deterministic policy settings.

To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model's own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address."}

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes."}

However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.\n  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.\n  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated."}

When the length is unknown, as in realistic completion and infilling, naively comparing confidence across mask lengths becomes systematically biased, leading to under-generation or redundant continuations. In this paper, we show that this failure arises from an intrinsic lengthinduced bias in generation confidence estimates, leaving existing DLLMs without a robust way to determine generation length and making variablelength inference unreliable. To address this issue, we propose LR-DLLM, a length-regularized inference framework for DLLMs that treats generation length as an explicit variable and achieves reliable length determination at inference time. It decouples semantic compatibility from lengthinduced uncertainty through an explicit length regularization that corrects biased confidence estimates. Based on this, LR-DLLM enables dynamic expansion or contraction of the generation span without modifying the underlying DLLM or its training procedure. Experiments show that LRDLLM achieves 51.3% Pass@1 on HumanEvalInfilling under fully unknown lengths (+13.4% vs. DreamOn) and 51.5% average Pass@1 on four-language McEval (+14.3% vs. DreamOn)."}

Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01°$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results.

In this setting, Tian et al. (2021) show that achieving no-external-regret is impossible without incurring an exponential dependence on the episode length $H$. They then turn to the weaker notion of Nash-value regret and propose a V-learning algorithm with regret $O(K^{2/3})$ after $K$ episodes. However, their algorithm and guarantee do not adapt to the difficulty of the problem: even in the case where the opponent follows a fixed policy and thus $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret is well-known to be achievable, their result is still the worse rate $O(K^{2/3})$ on a weaker metric.\n  In this work, we fully address both limitations. First, we introduce empirical Nash-value regret, a new regret notion that is strictly stronger than Nash-value regret and naturally reduces to external regret when the opponent follows a fixed policy. Moreover, under this new metric, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that achieves an $O(\\min \\{\\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\\sqrt{LK}\\})$ regret bound, where $C$ quantifies the variance of the opponent's policies and $L$ denotes the number of policy switches (both at most $O(K)$). Therefore, our results not only recover the two extremes -- $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret when the opponent is fixed and $O(K^{2/3})$ Nash-value regret in the worst case -- but also smoothly interpolate between these extremes by automatically adapting to the opponent's non-stationarity. We achieve so by first providing a new analysis of the epoch-based V-learning algorithm by Mao et al. (2022), establishing an $O(ηC + \\sqrt{K/η})$ regret bound, where $η$ is the epoch incremental factor. Next, we show how to adaptively restart this algorithm with an appropriate $η$ in response to the potential non-stationarity of the opponent, eventually achieving our final results."}

Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance.

Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny.

Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

Interestingly, we find that the reverse direction of this asymmetry behaves differently: learning to self-verify can effectively improve generation performance, achieving accuracy comparable to standard generation training while yielding more efficient and effective reasoning traces. Building on this observation, we further explore integrating self-verification into generation training by formulating a multi-task reinforcement learning framework, where generation and self-verification are optimized as two independent but complementary objectives.

The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances.

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off. Our results demonstrate that FADE achieves strong concept erasure and high retainability across various domains, making it a suitable solution for selective unlearning in diffusion-based image generation models."}

This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance. Furthermore, we find that the model scales its retrieval frequency with the difficulty of the problem, reinforcing that the decision to retrieve is a crucial metacognitive signal. The agent's ability to self-assess its knowledge and selectively engage with external information represents a key principle for building more robust and reliable generative models."}

To understand where approximation becomes difficult under fixed local capacity, we analyze the method from a spectral Barron norm perspective, which reveals that global reconstruction error is dominated by regions with high spectral complexity.

We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery."}

Prior works on LLM-based tutoring typically learn a single tutor policy and do not capture the diversity of tutoring styles. In real-world tutor-student interactions, pedagogical intent is realized through adaptive instructional strategies, with tutors varying the level of scaffolding, instructional directiveness, feedback, and affective support in response to learners' needs. These differences can all impact dialogue dynamics and student engagement. In this paper, we explore how tutor personas embedded in human tutor-student dialogues can be used to guide LLM behavior without relying on explicitly prompted instructions. We modify Bidirectional Preference Optimization (BiPO) to learn a steering vector, an activation-space direction that steers model responses towards certain tutor personas. We find that this steering vector captures tutor-specific variation across dialogue contexts, improving semantic alignment with ground-truth tutor utterances and increasing preference-based evaluations, while largely preserving lexical similarity. Analysis of the learned directional coefficients further reveals interpretable structure across tutors, corresponding to consistent differences in tutoring behavior. These results demonstrate that activation steering offers an effective and interpretable way for controlling tutor-specific variation in LLMs using signals derived directly from human dialogue data."}

The method formulates contamination assessment as a regression task at the railcar level and leverages sequential data through multi-instance learning (MIL) and multi-task learning (MTL).

We train several attention-based TSP policies, collect their internal activations, and train probes on node/edge embeddings for two NP-hard prescriptive downstream tasks inspired by real-world logistics scenarios: node-removal sensitivity (identifying the most impactful node to remove) and edge-forbid sensitivity (identifying the most critical edge to retain). On a Euclidean TSP100-trained model, probes for both tasks are competitive with existing baselines. Ensembling probe signals with geometric features outperforms the strongest baselines: 65\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 58\\% baseline) for the best-node-removal task, and 73\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 67\\% baseline) for the worst-edge identification task.

Nevertheless, important open questions remain: in under-resolved regimes, which filter is most suitable for a given stabilization or closure model? Moreover, once a filter is selected, how should its parameters, such as the filter radius, be determined? Addressing these questions is essential for the reliable design and performance of filter-based stabilization strategies. To answer these questions, we propose a novel strategy that differs fundamentally from current filter-based approaches: we replace traditional spatial filters with a data-driven stabilization operator (StabOp) that yields accurate results for a given resolution, quantity of interest, and stabilization strategy. Although the new StabOp can be used for both classical discretizations and ROMs, and for different types of filter-based stabilization or closure, for clarity we focus on ROMs and the Leray stabilization. To build the new StabOp, we postulate its model form as a linear, quadratic, or nonlinear mapping, and then solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem to minimize a given loss function. Using the resulting StabOp in the Leray ROM (L-ROM) yields a new stabilized ROM, StabOp-L-ROM. To assess the StabOp-L-ROM, we compare it with the L-ROM and the standard ROM in numerical simulations of four flows: 2D flow past a cylinder at Re=500, lid-driven cavity at Re=10000, 3D flow past a hemisphere at Re=2200, and minimal channel flow at Re=5000. Our numerical results show that the StabOp-L-ROM can be orders of magnitude more accurate than the classical L-ROM tuned with an optimal filter radius in the predictive regime. Furthermore, while the new StabOp smooths the input flow fields, its smoothing mechanism differs from that of classical spatial filters."}

Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

However, LLM judges show biases for length and order among others, and are vulnerable to various adversarial input prompts. While recent studies have looked into these biases, few have analyzed them at a more granular level in relation to a well-defined overlap metric. In this work we provide an LLM judge bias analysis as a function of overlap with human-written responses in the domain of summarization. We test 9 recent LLMs with parameter counts ranging from 1 billion to 12 billion, including variants of Gemma 3 and LLaMA 3. We find that LLM judges increasingly prefer summaries generated by other LLMs over those written by humans as the similarities (as measured by ROUGE and BLEU) between the judged summaries decrease, and this pattern extends to all but one model tested, and exists regardless of the models' own position biases. Additionally, we find that models struggle to judge even summaries with limited overlaps, suggesting that LLM-as-a-judge in the summary domain should rely on techniques beyond a simple comparison."}

Intuitively, users with similar tasks must be able to assist each other in boosting the effective fine-tuning data size. We propose Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation, or CoLoRA, which exploits task similarity to collaboratively and efficiently fine-tune personalized foundation models. The main idea in CoLoRA is to train one shared adapter capturing underlying task similarities across all tasks, and personalized adapters tailored to user-specific tasks. We theoretically study CoLoRA on heterogeneous linear regression and provide provable guarantees for ground truth recovery. We also conduct several natural language experiments with varying task similarity, which further demonstrate that when trained together with similar tasks, individual performances are significantly boosted."}

Existing approaches rely on heuristic methods such as selecting recent interactions or prompting summarization models to compress user profiles. However, these methods treat context as a monolithic whole and fail to consider how LLMs internally process and prioritize different profile components. We investigate whether LLMs' attention patterns can effectively identify important personalization signals for intelligent context compression. Through preliminary studies on representative personalization tasks, we discover that (a) LLMs' attention patterns naturally reveal important signals, and (b) fine-tuning enhances LLMs' ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. Based on these insights, we propose Attn-GS, an attention-guided context compression framework that leverages attention feedback from a marking model to mark important personalization sentences, then guides a compression model to generate task-relevant, high-quality compressed user contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Attn-GS significantly outperforms various baselines across different tasks, token limits, and settings, achieving performance close to using full context while reducing token usage by 50 times."}

We propose Bird-SR, a bidirectional reward-guided diffusion framework that formulates super-resolution as trajectory-level preference optimization via reward feedback learning (ReFL), jointly leveraging synthetic LR-HR pairs and real-world LR images. For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on real-world SR benchmarks demonstrate that Bird-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality while preserving structural consistency, validating its effectiveness for real-world super-resolution."}

However, this approach relies on standalone KV selection algorithms to select the KV entries used for drafting and overlooks that the criticality of each KV entry is inherently computed during verification. In this paper, we propose SpecAttn, a self-speculative decoding method with verification-guided sparse attention. SpecAttn identifies critical KV entries as a byproduct of verification and only loads these entries when drafting subsequent tokens. This not only improves draft token acceptance rate but also incurs low KV selection overhead, thereby improving decoding throughput.

To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical dual-encoder design: a Macro-Encoder to model full-night temporal dependencies and a Micro-Encoder to capture short-term characteristics from biosignals.

Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions. Together, these findings provide evidence that LLMs dynamically construct and use structured, latent representations in context for inference, offering insights into the computational processes underlying flexible adaptation."}

This motivates the development of sample-efficient performance estimators, which aim to estimate model performance by strategically selecting instances for labeling, thereby reducing annotation cost. Yet existing evaluation approaches often fail in low-variance settings: RMSE conflates bias and variance, masking persistent bias when variance is small, while p-value based tests become hypersensitive, rejecting adequate estimators for negligible deviations. To address this, we propose a fault-tolerant evaluation framework that integrates bias and variance considerations within an adjustable tolerance level ${\\varepsilon}$, enabling the evaluation of performance estimators within practically acceptable error margins. We theoretically show that proper calibration of ${\\varepsilon}$ ensures reliable evaluation across different variance regimes, and we further propose an algorithm that automatically optimizes and selects ${\\varepsilon}$.

Our experiments span across seven models, three benchmarks, and two thinking instantiations, and we evaluate them through both a quantitative response taxonomy analysis and qualitative failure propagation case studies. Contrary to expectations, we find that mandatory thinking often backfires on agents in user-engaged settings, causing anomalous performance degradation across various LLMs. Our key finding reveals that thinking makes agents more ``introverted'' by shortening responses and reducing information disclosure to users, which weakens agent-user information exchange and leads to downstream task failures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicitly prompting for information disclosure reliably improves performance across diverse model families, suggesting that proactive transparency is a vital lever for agent optimization.

Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations. To illustrate the working of ONTrust, the ontology is applied to model two case studies extracted from the literature."}

Layer-wise pruning, a commonly employed strategy to mitigate inference costs, can partially address this challenge. However, existing approaches generally depend on static heuristic rules and fail to account for the interdependencies among layers, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the pruning process. To this end, this paper proposes a game-theoretic framework that formulates layer pruning as a cooperative game in which each layer acts as a player and model performance serves as the utility. As computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible for large language models (LLMs), we propose using a lightweight surrogate network to estimate layer-wise marginal contributions. This network can predict LLM performance for arbitrary layer combinations at a low computational cost. Additionally, we employ stratified Monte Carlo mask sampling to further reduce the cost of Sharpley value estimation. This approach captures inter-layer dependencies and dynamically identifies critical layers for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method in terms of perplexity and zero-shot accuracy, achieving more efficient and effective layer-wise pruning for large language models."}

Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel. In practice, ArcMark outperforms competing multi-bit watermarks in terms of bit rate per token and detection accuracy.

We probe the hidden states of several smaller open-source LLMs. A single linear projection of an appropriate hidden layer encodes the log-magnitudes of both kinds of numerals, allowing us to recover the numbers with relative error of about 2.3% (on restricted synthetic text) or 19.06% (on scientific papers). Furthermore, the hidden state after reading a pair of numerals encodes their ranking, with a linear classifier achieving over 90% accuracy. Yet surprisingly, when explicitly asked to rank the same pairs of numerals, these LLMs achieve only 50-70% accuracy, with worse performance for models whose probes are less effective.

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed for effective zero-shot transfer to unstructured outdoors. Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands.

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs."}

Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field."}

While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D."}

To enable a systematic study of this phenomenon, we introduce MACE, a benchmark of 12,000 factual questions spanning six domains with varying numbers of correct answers. Experiments across 15 representative calibration methods and four LLM families (7B-72B) reveal that while accuracy increases with answer cardinality, estimated confidence consistently decreases, causing severe miscalibration for questions with mixed answer counts.

Jobs often differ in adapter rank, batch size, and resource allocation, and naïve batching can introduce synchronization stalls, communication overheads, and per-job slowdowns that are worse than executing independently.

Via causal mediation, we identify that instruction representation is fairly localized in models. These representations, which we call Instruction Vectors (IVs), demonstrate a curious juxtaposition of linear separability along with non-linear causal interaction, broadly questioning the scope of the linear representation hypothesis commonplace in mechanistic interpretability. To disentangle the non-linear causal interaction, we propose a novel method to localize information processing in language models that is free from the implicit linear assumptions of patching-based techniques.

To meet these requirements, an edge server must render panoramic content, predict user head motion, and transmit a portion of the scene that is large enough to cover the user viewport while remaining within wireless bandwidth constraints. Each portion produces two feedback signals: prediction feedback, indicating whether the selected portion covers the actual viewport, and transmission feedback, indicating whether the corresponding packets are successfully delivered. Prior work models this problem as a multi-armed bandit with two-level bandit feedback, but fails to exploit the fact that prediction feedback can be retrospectively computed for all candidate portions once the user head pose is observed. As a result, prediction feedback constitutes full-information feedback rather than bandit feedback. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a two-level hybrid feedback model that combines full-information and bandit feedback, and formulate the portion selection problem as an online learning task under this setting. We derive an instance-dependent regret lower bound for the hybrid feedback model and propose AdaPort, a hybrid learning algorithm that leverages both feedback types to improve learning efficiency. We further establish an instance-dependent regret upper bound that matches the lower bound asymptotically, and demonstrate through real-world trace driven simulations that AdaPort consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods."}

Project page: https://lhyfst.github.io/balancehead/", "summary": "Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability."}

While many prior approaches mitigate this effect through architectural modifications or residual mechanisms, the underlying spectral cause of oversmoothing is often left implicit. We propose Laplacian-LoRA, a simple and interpretable low-rank spectral adaptation of standard GCNs. Rather than redesigning message passing, Laplacian-LoRA introduces a learnable, spectrally anchored correction to the fixed Laplacian propagation operator, selectively weakening contraction while preserving stability and the low-pass inductive bias. Across multiple benchmark datasets and depths, Laplacian-LoRA consistently delays the onset of oversmoothing, extending the effective depth of GCNs by up to a factor of two. Embedding variance diagnostics confirm that these gains arise from delayed representational collapse, while learned spectral analysis demonstrates that the correction is smooth, bounded, and well behaved. Our results show that oversmoothing is a depth-dependent spectral phenomenon that can be systematically delayed through modest, low-rank adaptation of the graph propagation operator."}

A Comparative Study on the Cross-Lingual Transfer of Composite Harms", "comment": "Accepted at the AICS Workshop, AAAI 2026", "summary": "Most safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) remain anchored in English. Translation is often used as a shortcut to probe multilingual behavior, but it rarely captures the full picture, especially when harmful intent or structure morphs across languages. Some types of harm survive translation almost intact, while others distort or disappear. To study this effect, we introduce CompositeHarm, a translation-based benchmark designed to examine how safety alignment holds up as both syntax and semantics shift. It combines two complementary English datasets, AttaQ, which targets structured adversarial attacks, and MMSafetyBench, which covers contextual, real-world harms, and extends them into six languages: English, Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati. Using three large models, we find that attack success rates rise sharply in Indic languages, especially under adversarial syntax, while contextual harms transfer more moderately. To ensure scalability and energy efficiency, our study adopts lightweight inference strategies inspired by edge-AI design principles, reducing redundant evaluation passes while preserving cross-lingual fidelity. This design makes large-scale multilingual safety testing both computationally feasible and environmentally conscious. Overall, our results show that translated benchmarks are a necessary first step, but not a sufficient one, toward building grounded, resource-aware, language-adaptive safety systems."}

Rather than exchanging feature-dependent statistics or relying on noise injection for privacy, agents cluster their local views independently and reconcile their proposals through identifier-level consensus. Consensus is achieved via decentralized ordinal ranking to select representative medoids, progressively inducing a shared hierarchical clustering across agents. Communication is limited to sample identifiers, cluster labels, and ordinal rankings, providing privacy by design while supporting overlapping feature partitions and heterogeneous local clustering methods, and yielding an interpretable shared Cluster Fusion Hierarchy (CFH) that captures cross-view agreement at multiple resolutions.We analyze communication complexity and robustness, and experiments demonstrate competitive clustering performance in vertical federated settings."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data. Extensive experiments show that VeriTime substantially boosts LLM performance across diverse time series reasoning tasks.

Current solutions frequently struggle with cross-lingual generalization and fail to provide the transparent rationales essential for clinical trust. To address these barriers, we introduce SynCog, a novel framework integrating controllable zero-shot multimodal data synthesis with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) deduction fine-tuning. Specifically, SynCog simulates diverse virtual subjects with varying cognitive profiles to effectively alleviate clinical data scarcity. This generative paradigm enables the rapid, zero-shot expansion of clinical corpora across diverse languages, effectively bypassing data bottlenecks in low-resource settings and bolstering the diagnostic performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging this synthesized dataset, we fine-tune a foundational multimodal backbone using a CoT deduction strategy, empowering the model to explicitly articulate diagnostic thought processes rather than relying on black-box predictions. Extensive experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo benchmarks demonstrate that augmenting limited clinical data with synthetic phenotypes yields competitive diagnostic performance, achieving Macro-F1 scores of 80.67% and 78.46%, respectively, outperforming current baseline models. Furthermore, evaluation on an independent real-world Mandarin cohort (CIR-E) demonstrates robust cross-linguistic generalization, attaining a Macro-F1 of 48.71%.

While thresholding scores is Bayes-optimal in the unconstrained setting, using a single threshold generally violates statistical group fairness constraints. Under independence (statistical parity) and separation (equalized odds), such thresholding suffices when the scores already satisfy the corresponding criterion. However, this does not extend to sufficiency: even perfectly group-calibrated scores -- including true class probabilities -- violate predictive parity after thresholding. In this work, we present an exact solution for optimal binary (randomized) classification under sufficiency, assuming finite sets of group-calibrated scores. We provide a geometric characterization of the feasible pairs of positive predictive value (PPV) and false omission rate (FOR) achievable by such classifiers, and use it to derive a simple post-processing algorithm that attains the optimal classifier using only group-calibrated scores and group membership. Finally, since sufficiency and separation are generally incompatible, we identify the classifier that minimizes deviation from separation subject to sufficiency, and show that it can also be obtained by our algorithm, often achieving performance comparable to the optimum."}

A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on content quality, remain invariant to irrelevant context, and transparently reflect the factors driving its decisions. We test this ideal via controlled cue perturbations-synthetic metadata labels injected into evaluation prompts-for six judge models: GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Gemma-3-27B, Qwen3-235B, Claude-3-Haiku, and Llama3-70B. Experiments span two complementary datasets with distinct evaluation regimes: ELI5 (factual QA) and LitBench (open-ended creative writing). We study six cue families: source, temporal, age, gender, ethnicity, and educational status. Beyond measuring verdict shift rates (VSR), we introduce cue acknowledgment rate (CAR) to quantify whether judges explicitly reference the injected cues in their natural-language rationales. Across cues with strong behavioral effects-e.g., provenance hierarchies (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown), recency preferences (New > Old), and educational-status favoritism-CAR is typically at or near zero, indicating that shortcut reliance is largely unreported even when it drives decisions. Crucially, CAR is also dataset-dependent: explicit cue recognition is more likely to surface in the factual ELI5 setting for some models and cues, but often collapses in the open-ended LitBench regime, where large verdict shifts can persist despite zero acknowledgment. The combination of substantial verdict sensitivity and limited cue acknowledgment reveals an explanation gap in LLM-as-judge pipelines, raising concerns about reliability of model-based evaluation in both research and deployment."}

A closely related but distinct problem is training models that are robust to internal perturbations to their weights, which may be an important need for future low-power hardware platforms. In this paper, we explore the usage of two methods, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) and random-weight perturbation (RWP), to find minima robust to a variety of random corruptions to weights. We consider the problem from two angles: generalization (how do we reduce the noise-robust generalization gap) and optimization (how do we maximize performance from optimizers when subject to strong perturbations). First, we establish, both theoretically and empirically, that an over-regularized RWP training objective is optimal for noise-robust generalization. For small-magnitude noise, we find that SAM's adversarial objective further improves performance over any RWP configuration, but performs poorly for large-magnitude noise. We link the cause of this to a vanishing-gradient effect, caused by unevenness in the loss landscape, affecting both SAM and RWP. Lastly, we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the perturbation strength to match the evolution of the loss landscape improves optimizing for these perturbed objectives."}

Concerningly, a pre-registered survey of experts failed to predict this result, highlighting our poor understanding of the inductive biases governing learning and generalisation in LLMs. We use emergent misalignment (EM) as a case study to investigate these inductive biases and find that models can just learn the narrow dataset task, but that the general solution appears to be more stable and more efficient. To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation. More broadly, it offers a detailed case study and preliminary metrics for investigating how inductive biases shape generalisation in LLMs. We open-source all code, datasets and model finetunes."}

We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift. We instantiate ShaPO at two levels: token-level ShaPO stabilizes likelihood-based surrogate optimization, while reward-level ShaPO enforces reward-consistent optimization under noisy supervision. Across diverse safety benchmarks and noisy preference settings, ShaPO consistently improves safety robustness over popular preference optimization methods. Moreover, ShaPO composes cleanly with data-robust objectives, yielding additional gains and empirically supporting the proposed optimization-geometry perspective."}

Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse.

However, existing frameworks encounter a fundamental dilemma between compressing redundant information efficiently and maintaining precise retrieval for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose MemFly, a framework grounded in information bottleneck principles that facilitates on-the-fly memory evolution for LLMs. Our approach minimizes compression entropy while maximizing relevance entropy via a gradient-free optimizer, constructing a stratified memory structure for efficient storage. To fully leverage MemFly, we develop a hybrid retrieval mechanism that seamlessly integrates semantic, symbolic, and topological pathways, incorporating iterative refinement to handle complex multi-hop queries. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MemFly substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in memory coherence, response fidelity, and accuracy."}

Metric-based methods, which extract statistically distinguishable features of MGTs, are often more practical than complex model-based methods that are prone to overfitting. Given their diverse designs, we first place representative metric-based methods within a unified framework, enabling a clear assessment of their advantages and limitations. Our analysis identifies a core challenge across these methods: the token-level detection score is easily biased by the inherent randomness of the MGTs generation process. To address this, we theoretically and empirically reveal two relationships of context detection scores that may aid calibration: Neighbor Similarity and Initial Instability. We then propose a Markov-informed score calibration strategy that models these relationships using Markov random fields, and implements it as a lightweight component via a mean-field approximation, allowing our method to be seamlessly integrated into existing detectors. Extensive experiments in various real-world scenarios, such as cross-LLM and paraphrasing attacks, demonstrate significant gains over baselines with negligible computational overhead.

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings."}

However, existing steering-based alignment methods suffer from limited controllability: steering a target value often unintentionally activates other, non-target values. To characterize this limitation, we introduce value leakage, a diagnostic notion that captures the unintended activation of non-target values during value steering, along with a normalized leakage metric grounded in Schwartz's value theory. In light of this analysis, we propose NeVA, a neuron-level editing framework for controllable value alignment in LLMs. NeVA identifies sparse, value-relevant neurons and performs inference-time activation editing, enabling fine-grained control without parameter updates or retraining. Experiments show that NeVA achieves stronger target value alignment while incurring smaller performance degradation on general capability. Moreover, NeVA significantly reduces the average leakage, with residual effects largely confined to semantically related value classes. Overall, NeVA offers a more controllable and interpretable mechanism for value alignment."}

However, studies find that these methods always propagate the information to very limited neighborhoods with shallow depth, particularly due to over-smoothing. That means most of the existing MPNNs fail to be so `deep'. Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms almost all of the baselines on accuracy, stability, and time consumption. Additionally, the proposed method can be considered as a component that can underpin almost all GCN tasks, with DGCRL being demonstrated in the experiment.

We introduce TDGNet, a temporal dynamic graph framework that formulates hallucination detection as learning over evolving token-level attention graphs. At each denoising step, we sparsify the attention graph and update per-token memories via message passing, then apply temporal attention to aggregate trajectory-wide evidence for final prediction. Experiments on LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across QA benchmarks show consistent AUROC improvements over output-based, latent-based, and static-graph baselines, with single-pass inference and modest overhead. These results highlight the importance of temporal reasoning on attention graphs for robust hallucination detection in diffusion language models."}

Guided by this, we propose Unlearnable Tabular Data via DecOuPled Shortcut EmbeddIng (UTOPIA), which exploits feature redundancy to decouple optimization into two channels: high saliency features for semantic obfuscation and low saliency redundant features for embedding a hyper correlated shortcut, yielding constraint-aware dominant shortcuts while preserving tabular validity. Extensive experiments across tabular datasets and models show UTOPIA drives unauthorized training toward near random performance, outperforming strong UE baselines and transferring well across architectures."}

Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation."}

Deliberation follows a consistent trajectory: an exploration phase where probability mass spreads across candidates, tentative commitment to a frontrunner, and either convergence or backtracking. Backtracking is prevalent (32% of instances), beneficial (34% accuracy gain over non-backtracking instances), and predominantly directed away from the semantically closest distractor toward the correct answer.

To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline.

Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\\%, 13.36\\%, and 12.56\\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

While generally structured, these documents are often dense, bureaucratic, and highly heterogeneous across municipalities, exhibiting significant variation in language, terminology, structure, and overall organization. This heterogeneity makes them difficult for non-experts to interpret and challenging for intelligent automated systems to process, limiting public transparency and civic engagement. To address these challenges, computational methods can be employed to structure and interpret such complex documents. In particular, Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers well-established methods that can enhance the accessibility and interpretability of governmental records. In this focus article, we review foundational NLP tasks that support the structuring of local governance meeting documents. Specifically, we review three core tasks: document segmentation, domain-specific entity extraction and automatic text summarization, which are essential for navigating lengthy deliberations, identifying political actors and personal information, and generating concise representations of complex decision-making processes. In reviewing these tasks, we discuss methodological approaches, evaluation metrics, and publicly available resources, while highlighting domain-specific challenges such as data scarcity, privacy constraints, and source variability. By synthesizing existing work across these foundational tasks, this article provides a structured overview of how NLP can enhance the structuring and accessibility of local governance meeting records."}

Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models."}

The accumulated walk scores are used to select top-k attention blocks, enabling dynamic sparsity with a single training-free algorithm that applies uniformly to both the prefill and decode phases, together with custom sparse attention kernels. Across a wide range of models and tasks, Sketch&Walk maintains near-lossless accuracy at 20% attention density and can slightly outperform dense attention in some settings, while achieving up to 6x inference speedup."}

However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as \"context rot\". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate. We open-source LOCA-bench to provide a platform for evaluating models and scaffolds in long-context, agentic scenarios: https://github.com/hkust-nlp/LOCA-bench"}

However, heterogenous human-AI pairs fail -- suggesting differences in communicative tendencies. In Experiment 2, we ask whether LLMs can be induced to behave more like human conversants, by prompting them to produce superficially humanlike behavior. While the length of their messages matches that of human pairs, accuracy and lexical overlap in human-LLM pairs continues to lag behind that of both human-human and AI-AI pairs. These results suggest that conversational alignment requires more than just the ability to mimic previous interactions, but also shared interpretative biases toward the meanings that are conveyed."}

While recent data-driven methods promise to accelerate parts of this process, they largely fail to support end-to-end scientific discovery. To address this gap, we introduce EXPERIGEN, an agentic framework that operationalizes end-to-end discovery through a Bayesian optimization inspired two-phase search, in which a Generator proposes candidate hypotheses and an Experimenter evaluates them empirically. Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research.

Importantly, this behavior emerges naturally from one-stage pretraining on general text and reduces computation in both training and inference via token-wise adaptive halting.

We propose the first BO algorithm that achieves no-regret guarantee in a general reward setting, requiring only Lipschitz continuity of the objective function and accommodating a broad class of measurement noise. The core of our approach is a novel surrogate model, termed as infinite Gaussian process ($\\infty$-GP). It is a Bayesian nonparametric model that places a prior on the space of reward distributions, enabling it to represent a substantially broader class of reward models than classical Gaussian process (GP). The $\\infty$-GP is used in combination with Thompson Sampling (TS) to enable effective exploration and exploitation. Correspondingly, we develop a new TS regret analysis framework for general rewards, which relates the regret to the total variation distance between the surrogate model and the true reward distribution. Furthermore, with a truncated Gibbs sampling procedure, our method is computationally scalable, incurring minimal additional memory and computational complexities compared to classical GP. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in settings with non-stationary, heavy-tailed, or other ill-conditioned rewards."}

In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework."}

Through layer-wise analysis, we attribute this failure to a parametric suppression phenomenon: specifically, in deep layers, certain FFN layers overwrite context-sensitive representations with memorized priors. To address this, we propose CoRect (Context-Aware Logit Contrast for Hidden State Rectification). By contrasting logits from contextualized and non-contextualized forward passes, CoRect identifies layers that exhibit high parametric bias without requiring ground-truth labels. It then rectifies the hidden states to preserve evidence-grounded information. Across question answering (QA) and summarization benchmarks, CoRect consistently improves faithfulness and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines."}

Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction.

Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation.

To fill this gap, we introduce the first conceptual and methodological framework for unintended CUA behaviors, by defining their key characteristics, automatically eliciting them, and analyzing how they arise from benign inputs. We propose AutoElicit: an agentic framework that iteratively perturbs benign instructions using CUA execution feedback, and elicits severe harms while keeping perturbations realistic and benign. Using AutoElicit, we surface hundreds of harmful unintended behaviors from state-of-the-art CUAs such as Claude 4.5 Haiku and Opus.

While optimal algorithms are known for each measure individually, there is no known algorithm achieving optimal bounds for both simultaneously. Marinov and Zimmert [2021] first showed that such simultaneous optimality is impossible against an adaptive adversary. Our work takes a first step to demonstrate its possibility against an oblivious adversary when losses are deterministic. First, we extend the impossibility result of Marinov and Zimmert [2021] to the case of deterministic losses. Then, we present an algorithm achieving optimal static and dynamic regret simultaneously against an oblivious adversary. Together, they reveal a fundamental separation between adaptive and oblivious adversaries when multiple regret benchmarks are considered simultaneously. It also provides new insight into the long open problem of simultaneously achieving optimal regret against switching benchmarks of different numbers of switches.\n  Our algorithm uses negative static regret to compensate for the exploration overhead incurred when controlling dynamic regret, and leverages Blackwell approachability to jointly control both regrets.

This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions.

In this work, we investigate unsupervised approaches to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs, eliminating the need for heavy human annotations or teacher models' supervision. Specifically, we first replace a few paragraphs with special placeholders in a long document.

Existing evaluators frequently struggle with a critical perception gap we term \"Attention Collapse,\" where models neglect cross-image comparisons and fail to capture fine-grained details, resulting in inaccurate perception and miscalibrated scores. To address these limitations, we propose SpatialReward, a reward model that enforces precise verification via explicit spatial reasoning. By anchoring reasoning to predicted edit regions, SpatialReward grounds semantic judgments in pixel-level evidence, significantly enhancing evaluative accuracy. Trained on a curated 260k spatial-aware dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and outperforms proprietary evaluators on our proposed MultiEditReward-Bench. Furthermore, SpatialReward serves as a robust signal in online RL, boosting OmniGen2 by +0.90 on GEdit-Bench--surpassing the leading discriminative model and doubling the gain of GPT-4.1 (+0.45).

However, a theoretical understanding of why sign-based updates outperform variance-adapted methods remains elusive. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice through the lens of heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon frequently observed in language modeling tasks. Theoretically, we introduce a novel generalized heavy-tailed noise condition that captures the behavior of LLMs more accurately than standard finite variance assumptions. Under this noise model, we establish sharp convergence rates of SignSGD and Lion for generalized smooth function classes, matching or surpassing previous best-known bounds. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to Muon and Muonlight, providing what is, to our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of matrix optimization under heavy-tailed stochasticity. These results offer a strong theoretical justification for the empirical superiority of sign-based optimizers, showcasing that they are naturally suited to handle the noisy gradients associated with heavy tails. Empirically, LLM pretraining experiments validate our theoretical insights and confirm that our proposed noise models are well-aligned with practice."}

We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as \"malloc-only\" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.\n  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%.

While prior work observed that convexity and efficiency co-occur in color naming, the analytical relation between them and why they co-occur have not been well understood. We address this gap by combining analytical and empirical analyses that build on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework for semantic efficiency. First, we show that convexity and efficiency are distinct in the sense that neither entails the other: there are convex systems which are inefficient, and optimally-efficient systems that are non-convex. Crucially, however, the IB-optimal systems are mostly convex in the domain of color naming, explaining the main empirical basis for the convexity approach. Second, we show that efficiency is a stronger predictor for discriminating attested color naming systems from hypothetical variants, with convexity adding negligible improvement on top of that. Finally, we discuss a range of empirical phenomena that convexity cannot account for but efficiency can. Taken together, our work suggests that while convexity and efficiency can yield similar structural observations, they are fundamentally distinct, with efficiency providing a more comprehensive account of semantic typology."}

Although several public waste classification datasets exist, they remain fragmented, inconsistent, and biased toward specific environments. Differences in class names, annotation formats, image conditions, and class distributions make it difficult to combine these datasets or train models that generalize well to real world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the GlobalWasteData (GWD) archive, a large scale dataset of 89,807 images across 14 main categories, annotated with 68 distinct subclasses. We compile this novel integrated GWD archive by merging multiple publicly available datasets into a single, unified resource. This GWD archive offers consistent labeling, improved domain diversity, and more balanced class representation, enabling the development of robust and generalizable waste recognition models. Additional preprocessing steps such as quality filtering, duplicate removal, and metadata generation further improve dataset reliability.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Brep2Shape, a novel self-supervised pre-training method designed to align abstract boundary representations with intuitive shape representations. Our method employs a geometry-aware task where the model learns to predict dense spatial points from parametric Bézier control points, enabling the network to better understand physical manifolds derived from abstract coefficients. To enhance this alignment, we propose a Dual Transformer backbone with parallel streams that independently encode surface and curve tokens to capture their distinct geometric properties. Moreover, the topology attention is integrated to model the interdependencies between surfaces and curves, thereby maintaining topological consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Brep2Shape offers significant scalability, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and faster convergence across various downstream tasks."}

Our findings reveal that representativity-based acquisition functions effectively explore the dataset but do not prioritize boundary decisions, whereas uncertainty-based acquisition functions focus on refining boundary decisions already identified by the neural network.

To address this dilemma, we introduce six aggregation structures: series, parallel, hybrid, adaptive feedback, random exploration, and annealing exploration.

For this reason, an international group of more than 100 researchers at the recent 50th anniversary Asilomar Conference endorsed data controls to prevent the use of AI for harmful applications such as bioweapons development.

For each BDL tier, we propose technical restrictions appropriate to its level of risk. Finally, we outline a novel governance framework for newly created dual-use pathogen data.

At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv.

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data. PAR is compatible with multiple BC regularization paradigms. Extensive experiments across offline RL benchmarks show that PAR consistently improves performance and approaches state-of-the-art when combined with the basic TD3+BC."}

We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased. Empirically, we show that while traditional consensus methods fail under majority collusion, our approach successfully recovers the optimal policy."}

In this work, we align with the former view, proposing a probabilistic framework where capability is defined by instance-level solvability. We hypothesize that the emergence of complex reasoning can be driven by sharpening atomic step probabilities, which enables models to overcome the exponential decay of success rates inherent in multi-step reasoning chains. Utilizing the Algebrarium framework, we train models exclusively on single-step operations and evaluate their performance on unseen multi-step tasks. Our empirical results confirm that: (1) RLVR incentivizes the exploration of previously inaccessible solution paths by amplifying the model's existing skills; (2) composite performance is strictly governed by the joint probability of atomic steps, evidenced by high Pearson correlation coefficients ($ρ\\in [0.69, 0.96]$); and (3) RLVR, acting as a global optimizer, can cause specific skills to be sacrificed to maximize aggregate reward. Our work offers a novel explanation for emergent abilities in RLVR, suggesting that the iterative optimization of solvable problems enables models to develop the capabilities to tackle previously unsolvable scenarios."}

We propose a data-aware sensitivity framework that constrains the sensitive examples to remain close to the dataset, thereby producing realistic and interpretable evidence of model weaknesses. To this end, we develop novel techniques for data-aware search using a combination of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) encodings. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we strengthen the NP-hardness result for sensitivity verification, showing it holds even for trees of depth 1. Second, we develop MILP-optimizations that significantly speed up sensitivity verification for single ensembles and for the first time can also handle multiclass tree ensembles. Third, we introduce a data-aware framework generating realistic examples close to the training distribution. Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on large tree ensembles, demonstrating scalability to ensembles with up to 800 trees of depth 8, achieving substantial improvements over the state of the art.

Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs.

In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \\textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency.

However, conventional practices rely on random sequences of fixed length, overlooking the variable-length nature of LLM inputs. Input length directly influences the activation distribution and, consequently, the weight importance captured by the Hessian, which in turn affects quantization outcomes. As a result, Hessian estimates derived from fixed-length calibration may fail to represent the true importance of weights across diverse input scenarios. We propose MaCa (Matryoshka Calibration), a simple yet effective method for length-aware Hessian construction. MaCa (i) incorporates multi-scale sequence length information into Hessian estimation and (ii) regularizes each sequence as an independent sample, yielding a more stable and fruitful Hessian for accurate quantization. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3, LLaMA3) demonstrate that MaCa consistently improves accuracy under low bit quantization, offering a lightweight enhancement compatible with existing PTQ frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically highlight the role of multi-scale calibration in LLM quantization."}

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction. Findings reveal vulnerabilities requiring mitigation before clinical trials. The HHH framework and user-driven adversarial testing offer replicable methods for evaluating GenAI mental health interventions."}

We present a unified theoretical framework for analyzing the effect of arbitrary contextual information in Transformer-based LLMs. Our analysis characterizes contextual influence through output error dynamics. In a single-layer Transformer, we prove that the context-conditioned error vector decomposes additively into the baseline error vector and a contextual correction vector. This yields necessary geometric conditions for error reduction: the contextual correction must align with the negative baseline error and satisfy a norm constraint. We further show that the contextual correction norm admits an explicit upper bound determined by context-query relevance and complementarity. These results extend to multi-context and multi-layer Transformers.

Thus motivated, we introduce a new performance metric of MAB algorithms termed allocation variability, which is the largest (over arms) standard deviation of an arm's number of pulls. We establish a fundamental trade-off between allocation variability and regret, the canonical performance metric of reward maximization. In particular, for any algorithm, the worst-case regret $R_T$ and worst-case allocation variability $S_T$ must satisfy $R_T \\cdot S_T=Ω(T^{\\frac{3}{2}})$ as $T\\rightarrow\\infty$, as long as $R_T=o(T)$. This indicates that any minimax regret-optimal algorithm must incur worst-case allocation variability $Θ(T)$, the largest possible scale; while any algorithm with sublinear worst-case regret must necessarily incur ${S}_T= ω(\\sqrt{T})$. We further show that this lower bound is essentially tight, and that any point on the Pareto frontier $R_T \\cdot S_T=\\tildeΘ(T^{3/2})$ can be achieved by a simple tunable algorithm UCB-f, a generalization of the classic UCB1.

In this paper, we introduce Recursive Entropy to quantify the risk of resource consumption in reflection, thereby revealing the safety issues inherent in inference itself. Based on Recursive Entropy, we introduce RECUR, a resource exhaustion attack via Recursive Entropy guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection. It constructs counterfactual questions to verify the inherent flaws and risks of LRMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under benign inference, recursive entropy exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend. RECUR disrupts this trend, increasing the output length by up to 11x and decreasing throughput by 90%. Our work provides a new perspective on robust reasoning."}

To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric.

Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability."}

Second, since the thoughts are represented as tokens, they can be learned from natural language supervision, and using teacher-forcing, which is parallelizable. Empirically, Thinking States outperforms other latent reasoning methods on multiple reasoning tasks, narrowing the gap to CoT on math problems, and matching its performance on 2-Hop QA with improved latency.

To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvements on phrase grounding, image--text retrieval, and zero-shot classification, and even rivals pretraining methods that rely on substantial paired data."}

We further derive a simple formula in terms of these statistics that predicts data-limited neural scaling exponents from first principles without any free parameters or synthetic data models.

We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors.

We present UReason, a diagnostic benchmark for reasoning-driven image generation that evaluates whether reasoning can be faithfully executed in pixels. UReason contains 2,000 instances across five task families: Code, Arithmetic, Spatial, Attribute, and Text reasoning. To isolate the role of reasoning traces, we introduce an evaluation framework comparing direct generation, reasoning-guided generation, and de-contextualized generation which conditions only on the refined prompt. Across eight open-source unified models, we observe a consistent Reasoning Paradox: Reasoning traces generally improve performance over direct generation, yet retaining intermediate thoughts as conditioning context often hinders visual synthesis, and conditioning only on the refined prompt yields substantial gains. Our analysis suggests that the bottleneck lies in contextual interference rather than insufficient reasoning capacity. UReason provides a principled testbed for studying reasoning in unified models and motivates future methods that effectively integrate reasoning for visual generation while mitigating interference."}

Maximal Update Parametrization ($μ$P) helps explain why many hyperparameters transfer across width. Yet depth scaling is less understood for modern architectures, whose computation graphs contain multiple parallel paths and residual aggregation. To unify various non-recurrent multi-path neural networks such as CNNs, ResNets, and Transformers, we introduce a graph-based notion of effective depth. Under stabilizing initializations and a maximal-update criterion, we show that the optimal learning rate decays with effective depth following a universal -3/2 power law. Here, the maximal-update criterion maximizes the typical one-step representation change at initialization without causing instability, and effective depth is the minimal path length from input to output, counting layers and residual additions. Experiments across diverse architectures confirm the predicted slope and enable reliable zero-shot transfer of learning rates across depths and widths, turning depth scaling into a predictable hyperparameter-transfer problem."}

In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers.

To evaluate the quality of the dataset and its impact on emotion classification, eight pre-trained Transformer-based models were evaluated under three preprocessing strategies: preserving original emojis with rule-based normalization, converting emojis into textual descriptions, and applying ViSoLex, a model-based lexical normalization system. Results show that converting emojis into text often improves the performance of several BERT-based baselines, while preserving emojis yields the best results for ViSoBERT and CafeBERT. In contrast, removing emojis generally leads to lower performance. ViSoBERT achieved the highest Macro F1-score of 61.50% and Weighted F1-score of 63.26%.

Leveraging these properties, TEAM employs three complementary expert activation and decoding strategies, conservatively selecting necessary experts for decoded and masked tokens and simultaneously performing aggressive speculative exploration across multiple candidates. Experimental results demonstrate that TEAM achieves up to 2.2x speedup over vanilla MoE dLLM, with negligible performance degradation. Code is released at https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/TEAM-MoE-dLLM."}

SIGMA introduces selective multi-attribute tokens, including style, content, subject, and identity tokens, which allow the model to interpret and compose multiple visual conditions in an interleaved text-image sequence. Through post-training on the Bagel unified backbone with 700K interleaved examples, SIGMA supports compositional editing, selective attribute transfer, and fine-grained multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments show that SIGMA improves controllability, cross-condition consistency, and visual quality across diverse editing and generation tasks, with substantial gains over Bagel on compositional tasks."}

However, their sequential autoregressive decoding forces inherently parallel clinical reasoning, such as differential diagnosis, into a single linear reasoning path, limiting both efficiency and reliability for complex medical problems. To address this, we propose MedVerse, a reasoning framework for complex medical inference that reformulates medical reasoning as a parallelizable directed acyclic graph (DAG) process based on Petri net theory. The framework adopts a full-stack design across data, model architecture, and system execution. For data creation, we introduce the MedVerse Curator, an automated pipeline that synthesizes knowledge-grounded medical reasoning paths and transforms them into Petri net-structured representations. At the architectural level, we propose a topology-aware attention mechanism with adaptive position indices that supports parallel reasoning while preserving logical consistency. Systematically, we develop a customized inference engine that supports parallel execution without additional overhead. Empirical evaluations show that MedVerse improves strong general-purpose LLMs by up to 8.9%. Compared to specialized medical LLMs, MedVerse achieves comparable performance while delivering a 1.3x reduction in inference latency and a 1.7x increase in generation throughput, enabled by its parallel decoding capability."}

Whereas machine learning has been described as the automation of automation, generative AI operates by navigating contextual, semantic, and stylistic coherence rather than optimizing predefined objective metrics. This paper introduces the concept of Vibe-Automation to characterize this transition.\n  The central claim is that the significance of GenAI lies in its functional access to operationalized tacit regularities: context-sensitive patterns embedded in practice that cannot be fully specified through explicit algorithmic rules. Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.\n  The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity."}

Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\\mathbf{5.1\\times}$ speedup."}

We formulate compression as selecting a smallest subgraph capturing a prescribed fraction of the probability mass, and reduce to a weighted version of densest $k$-subgraphs in hypergraphs, in the regime where the subgraph has a large fraction of edges. We design efficient approximation algorithms that achieve constant factor coverage and size trade-offs. Crucially, we prove that our relaxation satisfies a monotonicity property, derived from a connection to parametric minimum cuts, which guarantees the nestedness required for valid conformal guarantees. Our results on the one hand bridge efficient conformal prediction with combinatorial graph compression via monotonicity, to provide rigorous guarantees on both statistical validity, and compression or size.

While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct. Finally, initial contexts with a morally right stance elicit stronger sycophantic behavior, emphasizing the vulnerability of VLMs to moral influence and the need for principled strategies to improve ethical consistency and robustness in multimodal AI systems."}

We examine this famous critic from both the perspective in pre-existing literature of linguistics and psychology as well as a research based on an experiment inquiring the capacity of learning both possible and impossible languages among LLMs. We constructed a set of syntactically impossible languages by applying certain transformations to English. These include reversing whole sentences, and adding negation based on word-count parity. Two rounds of controlled experiments were each conducted on GPT-2 small models and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Statistical analysis (Welch's t-test) shows GPT2 small models underperform in learning all of the impossible languages compared to their performance on the possible language (p<.001). On the other hand, LSTM models' performance tallies with Chomsky's argument, suggesting the irreplaceable role of the evolution of transformer architecture. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical findings, we propose a new vision within Chomsky's theory towards LLMs, and a shift of theoretical paradigm outside Chomsky, from his \"rationalist-romantics\" paradigm to functionalism and empiricism in LLMs research."}

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%). This work establishes a subspace-theoretic feature disentanglement framework for collaborative cross-camera cow identification, offering a new paradigm for precise animal monitoring in uncontrolled smart farming environments."}

Numerical investigations show that this task retains key qualitative aspects of how Transformers develop match-and-copy circuits in practice, and separates architectures by their retrieval capabilities. We also analyze the optimization dynamics in a simplified attention setting. Although many solutions are a priori possible under a regression objective, including ones that do not implement retrieval, we identify an implicit-bias regime in which gradient descent drives the parameters to diverge while their direction aligns with the max-margin separator, yielding hard match selection. We prove this max-margin alignment for GD trajectories that reach vanishing empirical loss under explicit technical conditions."}

However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively."}

To address these challenges, we provide a unified perspective. (1) We introduce the ME$^2$ principle to characterize reasoning quality along macro- and micro-level concerning efficiency and effectiveness. (2) Built on this principle, we model reasoning traces as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and develop a DAG-based pairwise evaluation method, capturing complex reasoning structures.

Experiments show that thinking rewards serve as an effective optimization signal. At test time, selecting better reasoning leads to better outcomes (up to 19.3% gain), and during RL training, thinking rewards enhance reasoning and performance (up to 3.9% gain) across diverse tasks."}

However most existing NN-based ensemble methods for TSC train multiple models with identical architectures and configurations. These ensembles aggregate predictions without explicitly promoting diversity which often leads to redundant feature representations and limits the benefits of ensembling. In this work, we introduce a diversity-driven ensemble learning framework that explicitly encourages feature diversity among neural network ensemble members. Our approach employs a decorrelated learning strategy using a feature orthogonality loss applied directly to the learned feature representations. This ensures that each model in the ensemble captures complementary rather than redundant information. We evaluate our framework on 128 datasets from the UCR archive and show that it achieves SOTA performance with fewer models.

A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation.

Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

In this paper, we propose an effect-centric, admissibility-first framework that treats discovered graphs as structural hypotheses and evaluates them by identifiability, stability, and falsification rather than by graph recovery accuracy alone. Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query. Therefore, trustworthy causal conclusions in telemetry-driven systems require prioritizing admissibility and effect-level validation over causal structural recovery alone."}

A Mechanistic Analysis of Cell Location", "comment": null, "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for table-related tasks, the internal mechanisms enabling them to process linearized two-dimensional structured tables remain opaque. In this work, we investigate the process of table understanding by dissecting the atomic task of cell location. Through activation patching and complementary interpretability techniques, we delineate the table understanding mechanism into a sequential three-stage pipeline: Semantic Binding, Coordinate Localization, and Information Extraction. We demonstrate that models locate the target cell via an ordinal mechanism that counts discrete delimiters to resolve coordinates. Furthermore, column indices are encoded within a linear subspace that allows for precise steering of model focus through vector arithmetic. Finally, we reveal that models generalize to multi-cell location tasks by multiplexing the identical attention heads identified during atomic location. Our findings provide a comprehensive explanation of table understanding within Transformer architectures."}

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation."}

When trying to turn these metrics into a single ranking, natural aggregation procedures can become incoherent or unstable to changes in the model set. We formalize this aggregation as a social choice problem where each metric induces a preference ranking over models on each dataset, and a benchmark operator aggregates these votes across metrics. While prior work has focused on Arrow's impossibility result, we argue that the impossibility often originates from pathological examples and identify sufficient conditions under which these disappear, and meaningful multi-criteria benchmarking becomes possible. In particular, we deal with three restrictions on the combinations of rankings and prove that on single-peaked, group-separable and distance-restricted preferences, the benchmark operator allows for the construction of well-behaved rankings of the involved models. Empirically, we investigate several modern benchmark suites like HELM MMLU and verify which structural conditions are fulfilled on which benchmark problems."}

Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in advancing the field of quality estimation of machine translation. However, most of the QE approaches solely rely on scalar quality scores, offering no explicit information about the translation errors that should drive these judgments. Moreover, for low-resource languages where annotated QE data is limited, existing approaches struggle to achieve reliable performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the first segment-level QE dataset for English to Malayalam, a severely resource-scarce language pair in the QE domain, comprising human-annotated Direct Assessment (DA) scores and Translation Quality Remarks (TQR), which are short, contextual, free-form annotator comments that describe translation errors. We further introduce ALOPE-RL, a policy-based reinforcement learning framework that trains efficient adapters based on policy rewards derived from DA score and TQR. Integrating error-aware rewards with ALOPE-RL, enables LLMs to reason about translation quality beyond numeric scores. Despite being trained on a small-scale QE dataset, ALOPE-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance on English to Malayalam QE using compact LLMs (<=4B parameters}) fine-tuned with LoRA and 4-bit quantization, outperforming both larger LLM-based baselines and leading encoder-based QE models. Our results demonstrate that error-aware, policy-based learning can deliver strong QE performance under limited data and compute budgets.

Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time."}

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1.

First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics.

In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

Our findings position evaluation as a learned linguistic capability of LLMs, consistent within models but fragmented across them, and call for new methods that jointly model human and LLM evaluative language to improve reliability and interpretability."}

To provide a rigorous and objective assessment, we curate the UMD dataset comprising 490 whole-body PET/CT and 464 whole-body PET/MRI scans ($\\sim$675k 2D images, $\\sim$12k 3D organ annotations) and conduct a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of representative 3D segmentation foundation models. Through intra-subject controlled comparisons of paired scans, we isolate imaging modality as the primary independent variable to evaluate model robustness in real-world applications. Our evaluation reveals a stark discrepancy between literature-reported benchmarks and real-world efficacy, particularly when transitioning from structural to functional domains. Such systemic failures underscore that current 3D foundation models are far from achieving truly general-purpose status, necessitating a paradigm shift toward multi-modal training and evaluation to bridge the gap between idealized benchmarking and comprehensive clinical utility.

To address the fundamental tension between batch decoding and expert sparsity, we present SERE, a Similarity-based Expert Re-routing method for Efficient batch decoding in MoE models. SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts. It also leverages similarity patterns to identify and preserve critical experts, thereby preventing capability loss. Notably, SERE avoids static expert pruning or merging, instead enabling dynamic expert skipping based on batch-level expert redundancy. Additionally, we provide an efficient custom CUDA kernel for SERE, enabling plug-and-play use in vLLM with only a single-line code change. Extensive experiments on various complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SERE achieves up to 2.0x speedup with minimal quality loss, providing a practical solution for cost-efficient and latency-sensitive large-scale MoE deployment.

Current approaches often rely on unreliable LLMs for safety checks or simply reject unsafe plans without offering repairs. We introduce the Verifiable Iterative Refinement Framework (VIRF), a neuro-symbolic architecture that shifts the paradigm from passive safety gatekeeping to active collaboration. Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents."}

We consider ReLU neural networks subject to natural constraints on weights and input and output dimensions, which model a notion of dense connectivity.

This work evaluates the errors across the reconstruction pipeline and explores the use of voxel and surface-based accuracy metrics for different segmentation algorithms and geometry types. A sphere, a facemask, and an AAA were printed using the SLA technique and scanned using a micro-CT machine. Segmentation was performed using GMM, Otsu and RG based methods. Segmented and reference models aligned using the KU algorithm, were quantitatively compared to evaluate metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, precision. Surface meshes were registered with reference meshes using an ICP-based alignment process. Metrics like chamfer distance, and average Hausdorff distance were evaluated. The Otsu method was found to be the most suitable method for all the geometries. AAA yielded low overlap scores due to its small wall thickness and misalignment. The effect of class imbalance on specificity was observed the most for AAA. Surface-based accuracy metrics differed from the voxel-based trends. The RG method performed best for sphere, while GMM and Otsu perform better for AAA. The facemask surface was most error-prone, possibly due to misalignment during the ICP process. Segmentation accuracy is a cumulative sum of errors across different stages of the reconstruction process. High voxel-based accuracy metrics may be misleading in cases of high class imbalance and sensitivity to alignment. The Jaccard index is found to be more stringent than the Dice and more suitable for accuracy assessment for thin-walled structures. Voxel and point cloud alignment should be ensured to make any reliable assessment of the reconstruction pipeline."}

We show that the resulting operator admits a clear geometric interpretation as a projection of distribution shift onto the sensitivity field of the model, yielding theoretical guarantees. Beyond detecting the presence of a shift, the same construction enables its localisation through a coordinate-wise decomposition, and for image data-provides interpretable per-pixel diagnostics.

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility."}

A Study on the Effect of Images on Clarifying Questions in Conversational Search", "comment": "Accepted at CHIIR 2025", "summary": "Conversational search systems increasingly employ clarifying questions to refine user queries and improve the search experience. Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of text-based clarifying questions in enhancing both retrieval performance and user experience. While images have been shown to improve retrieval performance in various contexts, their impact on user performance when incorporated into clarifying questions remains largely unexplored. We conduct a user study with 73 participants to investigate the role of images in conversational search, specifically examining their effects on two search-related tasks: (i) answering clarifying questions and (ii) query reformulation. We compare the effect of multimodal and text-only clarifying questions in both tasks within a conversational search context from various perspectives. Our findings reveal that while participants showed a strong preference for multimodal questions when answering clarifying questions, preferences were more balanced in the query reformulation task. The impact of images varied with both task type and user expertise. In answering clarifying questions, images helped maintain engagement across different expertise levels, while in query reformulation they led to more precise queries and improved retrieval performance. Interestingly, for clarifying question answering, text-only setups demonstrated better user performance as they provided more comprehensive textual information in the absence of images. These results provide valuable insights for designing effective multimodal conversational search systems, highlighting that the benefits of visual augmentation are task-dependent and should be strategically implemented based on the specific search context and user characteristics."}

In this research, we propose an augmentation to this framework, making a case for the audio modality as an additional source of information to understand the driver, and in the evolving autonomy landscape, also the passengers and those outside the vehicle. We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient.

Using a compact trading-strategy DSL with four semantic components (long/short entry and exit), we learn a matching block-factorized embedding and compare isotropic Gaussian mutation over the full latent space to geometry-compiled mutation that restricts updates to semantically paired entry--exit subspaces and proposes directions using a learned flow-based model trained on logged mutation outcomes.\n  Under identical $(μ+λ)$ evolution strategies and fixed evaluation budgets across five assets, the learned mutation operator discovers strong strategies using an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieves the highest median out-of-sample Sharpe ratio.

This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a novel, fully automated methodology for assessing the factual consistency of such summaries. The method is based on measuring the similarity between the claims in a given summary with those from the original reviews, measuring the coverage and consistency of the generated summary. To do so, we rely on a simple approach to extract factual assessment from texts that we then compare and summarize in a suitable score. We demonstrate that the proposed metric attributes higher scores to similar claims, regardless of whether the claim is negated, paraphrased, or expanded, and that the score has a high correlation to human judgment when compared to state-of-the-art metrics."}

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

Using KernelBench as our testbed and a 120B-parameter model (GPT-OSS-120B with LoRA adaptation), we find that search outperforms minimal adaptation (1-5 gradient steps): Best-of-N sampling achieves 90% task success (18/20 tasks) at K=64 across the full KernelBench L1 eval set while TTT's best checkpoint reaches only 30.6% (3-seed mean), with TTT's \"equivalent K\" falling below 1, worse than single-sample inference. The failure mode is over-sharpening: gradient updates collapse diversity toward mediocre solutions rather than discovering optimal ones. Our main contribution is surprisal-guided selection: selecting the highest-surprisal (lowest-confidence) correct sample yields 80% success vs. 50% for most-confident selection, a 30% improvement. Extending to surprisal-guided-top3 matches oracle performance at 100%. This zero-cost strategy, validated through length-controlled analysis, recovers oracle performance.

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow."}

Other debate-rich platforms such as Reddit and Kialo also offer promising material: Reddit provides linguistic diversity and scale but lacks clear argumentative structure, while Kialo supplies explicit pro/con graphs but remains overly concise and detached from natural discourse. We introduce PERSPECTRA, a pluralist benchmark that integrates the structural clarity of Kialo debate graphs with the linguistic diversity of real Reddit discussions. Using a controlled retrieval-and-expansion pipeline, we construct 3,810 enriched arguments spanning 762 pro/con stances on 100 controversial topics. Each opinion is expanded to multiple naturalistic variants, enabling robust evaluation of pluralism. We initialise three tasks with PERSPECTRA: opinion counting (identifying distinct viewpoints), opinion matching (aligning supporting stances and discourse to source opinions), and polarity check (inferring aggregate stance in mixed discourse). Experiments with state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, highlight systematic failures, such as overestimating the number of viewpoints and misclassifying concessive structures, underscoring the difficulty of pluralism-aware understanding and reasoning. By combining diversity with structure, PERSPECTRA establishes the first scalable, configurable benchmark for evaluating how well models represent, distinguish, and reason over multiple perspectives."}

PoT interleaves (i) temporal evidence selection, (ii) step-wise state updates, and (iii) constrained answer synthesis, enabling the model to progressively refine hypotheses while maintaining traceability to video evidence. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools. We further introduce a unified representation for PoT traces that aligns intermediate decisions with temporal segments, which improves robustness to distractors and reduces hallucinated explanations. Extensive experiments on standard video reasoning tasks demonstrate that PoT consistently improves factual correctness and temporal grounding, while providing interpretable reasoning traces for diagnosis and downstream use."}

Existing methods often fail to address distribution shift across clients and distribution drift over time, or they rely on unrealistic assumptions such as known number of client clusters and data heterogeneity types, which limits their generalizability. We introduce Feroma, a novel FL framework that explicitly handles both distribution shift and drift without relying on client or cluster identity. Feroma builds on client distribution profiles-compact, privacy-preserving representations of local data-that guide model aggregation and test-time model assignment through adaptive similarity-based weighting. This design allows Feroma to dynamically select aggregation strategies during training, ranging from clustered to personalized, and deploy suitable models to unseen, and unlabeled test clients without retraining, online adaptation, or prior knowledge on clients' data. Extensive experiments show that compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods, Feroma improves performance and stability under dynamic data heterogeneity conditions-an average accuracy gain of up to 12 percentage points over the best baselines across 6 benchmarks-while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg. These results highlight that distribution-profile-based aggregation offers a practical path toward robust FL under both data distribution shifts and drifts."}

They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch. Our approach utilizes a constrained tree-structure perspective to systematically model data relationships, and it can also easily be combined with other methods to extend more usages, such as asynchronous execution and variable-length data computation. Detailed examples and benchmarks show TreeTensor not only provides powerful usability in various problems, especially one of the most complicated AI systems at present: AlphaStar for StarCraftII, but also exhibits excellent runtime efficiency without any overhead.

These characteristics weaken the stability and regularity assumptions that many anomaly detection methods rely on in structured industrial settings, leading to notable performance degradation. To support evaluation and comparison in this setting, we construct \\textbf{CoalAD}, a benchmark for unsupervised foreign-object anomaly detection with pixel-level localization in coal-stream scenes.

Algorithmic recourse provides actionable input modifications to achieve more favorable outcomes, typically relying on counterfactual explanations to suggest such changes.

We introduce ElliCE, a novel framework for robust algorithmic recourse that optimizes counterfactuals over an ellipsoidal approximation of the Rashomon set. The resulting explanations are provably valid over this ellipsoid, with theoretical guarantees on uniqueness, stability, and alignment with key feature directions. Empirically, ElliCE generates counterfactuals that are not only more robust but also more flexible, adapting to user-specified feature constraints while being substantially faster than existing baselines. This provides a principled and practical solution for reliable recourse under model uncertainty, ensuring stable recommendations for users even as models evolve."}

Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture.

Our approach operates directly on embedding matrices, encouraging spectral balance, subspace consistency, and feature orthogonality through objectives defined entirely in terms of linear algebraic properties. Without relying on labels or generative reconstruction, dense feature learning produces representations with higher effective rank, improved conditioning, and greater stability across time. Empirical evaluations across longitudinal EHR data, clinical text, and multimodal patient representations demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream linear performance, robustness, and subspace alignment compared to supervised and self supervised baselines.

Built on Self Forcing (trained on only 5s clips), Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to ultra-long durations (e.g., 5-30 minutes at 16 FPS) at test time, with consistent subjects, stable colors, coherent structures, and smooth motions. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, Rolling Sink achieves superior long-horizon visual fidelity and temporal consistency compared to SOTA baselines.

While recent years have seen an increasing development of explainability methods, current evaluation metrics (e.g., fidelity, sparsity) often fail to assess whether an explanation identifies the true underlying causal variables. To address this, we propose the Explanation-Generalization Score (EGS), a metric that quantifies the causal relevance of GNN explanations. EGS is founded on the principle of feature invariance and posits that if an explanation captures true causal drivers, it should lead to stable predictions across distribution shifts. To quantify this, we introduce a framework that trains GNNs using explanatory subgraphs and evaluates their performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings (here, OOD generalization serves as a rigorous proxy for the explanation's causal validity). Through large-scale validation involving 11,200 model combinations across synthetic and real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that EGS provides a principled benchmark for ranking explainers based on their ability to capture causal substructures, offering a robust alternative to traditional fidelity-based metrics."}

Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization."}

Yet, automated systems that extract locations from text often reproduce existing geographic and socioeconomic biases, leading to uneven visibility of crisis-affected regions. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these geographic disparities in extracting location information from humanitarian documents. We introduce a two-step framework that combines few-shot LLM-based named entity recognition with an agent-based geocoding module that leverages context to resolve ambiguous toponyms. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art pretrained and rule-based systems using both accuracy and fairness metrics across geographic and socioeconomic dimensions. Our evaluation uses an extended version of the HumSet dataset with refined literal toponym annotations. Results show that LLM-based methods substantially improve both the precision and fairness of geolocation extraction from humanitarian texts, particularly for underrepresented regions. By bridging advances in LLM reasoning with principles of responsible and inclusive AI, this work contributes to more equitable geospatial data systems for humanitarian response, advancing the goal of leaving no place behind in crisis analytics."}

Empirical scaling laws are widely used to predict loss as model size and training data grow, however, almost all existing studies fix the optimizer (typically AdamW). At the same time, a new generation of optimizers (e.g., Muon, Shampoo, SOAP) promises faster and more stable convergence, but their relationship with model and data scaling is not yet well understood. In this work, we study scaling laws across different optimizers. Empirically, we show that 1) separate Chinchilla-style scaling laws for each optimizer are ill-conditioned and have highly correlated parameters. Instead, 2) we propose a more robust law with shared power-law exponents and optimizer-specific rescaling factors, which enable direct comparison between optimizers. Finally, 3) we provide a theoretical analysis of gradient-based methods for the proxy task of a convex quadratic objective, demonstrating that Chinchilla-style scaling laws emerge naturally as a result of loss decomposition into irreducible, approximation, and optimization errors."}

This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3. Interestingly, this last result implies that proving DQC lower bounds of log(n) + 6 for languages in P would yield new circuit lower bounds, connecting debate query complexity to central questions in circuit complexity."}

A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference."}

To address this, recent agentic thinking-with-videos paradigms have emerged, adopting a localize-clip-answer pipeline in which the model actively identifies relevant video segments, performs dense sampling within those clips, and then produces answers. However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance on both long video understanding and grounding."}

In this work we propose a rigorous analysis of such approximate posterior-samplers, relying on a Gaussianity assumption of the prior. Under this regime, we show that both the ideal posterior sampler and diffusion-based reconstruction algorithms can be expressed in closed-form, enabling their thorough analysis and comparisons in the spectral domain. Building on these representations, we also introduce a principled framework for parameter design, replacing heuristic selection strategies used to date. The proposed approach is method-agnostic and yields tailored parameter choices for each algorithm, jointly accounting for the characteristics of the prior, the degraded signal, and the diffusion dynamics. We show that our spectral recommendations differ structurally from standard heuristics and vary with the diffusion step size, resulting in a consistent balance between perceptual quality and signal fidelity."}

While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of \"trust\" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems."}

However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity.

Accepted AAMAS'26 submission", "summary": "Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) requires computing policies under imperfect state information. Despite recent advances, the scalability of existing POMDP solvers remains limited. Moreover, many settings require a policy that is robust across multiple POMDPs, further aggravating the scalability issue. We propose the Lexpop framework for POMDP solving. Lexpop (1) employs deep reinforcement learning to train a neural policy, represented by a recurrent neural network, and (2) constructs a finite-state controller mimicking the neural policy through efficient extraction methods. Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP. Using a set of such POMDPs, we iteratively train a robust neural policy and consequently extract a robust controller. Our experiments show that on problems with large state spaces, Lexpop outperforms state-of-the-art solvers for POMDPs as well as HM-POMDPs."}

They not only expose CUAs to safety risks, but also degrade task efficiency and reliability. This work makes the first effort to define and study misaligned action detection in CUAs, with comprehensive coverage of both externally induced and internally arising misaligned actions. We further identify three common categories in real-world CUA deployment and construct MisActBench, a benchmark of realistic trajectories with human-annotated, action-level alignment labels. Moreover, we propose DeAction, a practical and universal guardrail that detects misaligned actions before execution and iteratively corrects them through structured feedback. DeAction outperforms all existing baselines across offline and online evaluations with moderate latency overhead: (1) On MisActBench, it outperforms baselines by over 15% absolute in F1 score; (2) In online evaluation, it reduces attack success rate by over 90% under adversarial settings while preserving or even improving task success rate in benign environments."}

These limitations prevent existing methods from simultaneously supporting rich semantic understanding and multi-target detection. To address this, we propose OTA-Det, the first unified framework that bridges both paradigms into a cohesive architecture. Specifically, we introduce a task reformulation strategy that unifies task objectives and supervision mechanisms, enabling joint training across datasets from both paradigms with dense supervision signals. Furthermore, we propose a dense semantic alignment strategy that establishes explicit correspondence at multiple granularities, from holistic expressions to individual attributes, enabling fine-grained semantic understanding. To ensure real-time efficiency, OTA-Det builds upon the RT-DETR architecture, extending it from closed-set detection to open-text detection by introducing several high efficient modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning both OVAD and RSVG tasks while maintaining real-time inference at 34 FPS."}

LK constructs a task-agnostic library of options from these eigenvectors, forming a behavior basis guaranteed to contain the optimal policy for any reward within the linear span. A meta-policy learns to stitch these options dynamically, enabling efficient learning of policies outside the original linear constraints. We establish theoretical bounds on zero-shot approximation error and demonstrate empirically that LK surpasses zero-shot solutions while achieving improved sample efficiency compared to standard RL methods."}

These properties create two practical tensions. First, dense FFNs spend the same compute on every token regardless of context, and they allocate capacity uniformly even when language exhibits highly clustered context structure. Second, continual learning, in the sense of updating the model while serving a data stream, often produces interference because a small update touches broadly shared weights.\n  We propose Attractor Patch Networks (APN), a plug-compatible replacement for the Transformer FFN. APN is a bank of patch experts. A similarity router selects a small top-k set of patches for each token by matching the token representation to learned prototypes. Each selected patch emits a low-rank residual update conditioned on a compact code. The architecture yields conditional, context-specialized nonlinear transformations while preserving the standard Transformer interface.\n  This paper focuses on APN as an architectural primitive. We formalize APN, analyze its expressivity as a piecewise low-rank residual function class, and derive simple interference and stability arguments that make APN naturally compatible with continual learning. In experiments on character-level language modeling, APN achieves competitive perplexity (4.57 vs 4.32 PPL) while enabling dramatically better continual adaptation: when adapting to a shifted domain, APN achieves 2.6 times better retention (11.1 vs 29.4 PPL on the original domain) and 2.8 times better adaptation (6.4 vs 17.8 PPL on the new domain) compared to global fine-tuning of a dense FFN baseline."}

Adaptive Data Analysis (ADA) mechanisms address this challenge; however, there is a fundamental tension between computational efficiency and sample complexity. For $T$ rounds of adaptive analysis, computationally efficient algorithms typically incur suboptimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ sample complexity, whereas statistically optimal $O(\\log T)$ algorithms are computationally intractable under standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we shed light on this trade-off by identifying a natural class of data distributions under which both computational efficiency and optimal sample complexity are achievable. We propose a computationally efficient ADA mechanism that attains optimal $O(\\log T)$ sample complexity when the data distribution is dense with respect to a known prior. This setting includes, in particular, feature--label data distributions arising in distribution-specific learning. As a consequence, our mechanism also yields a sample-efficient (i.e., $O(\\log T)$ samples) statistical query oracle in the distribution-specific setting. Moreover, although our algorithm is not based on differential privacy, it satisfies a relaxed privacy notion known as Predicate Singling Out (PSO) security (Cohen and Nissim, 2020). Our results thus reveal an inherent connection between adaptive data analysis and privacy beyond differential privacy."}

We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment.

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities."}

We challenge this paradigm with a critical hypothesis: full all-atom resolution is unnecessary for accurate small molecule pose and binding affinity prediction. TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_β$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.\n  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

While diffusion models (DM) have recently gained attention for their ability to capture complex predictive distributions, two gaps remain: (i) the generative path is conditioned only on positive evidence, overlooking informative negative context, and (ii) training objectives are dominated by cross-entropy ranking, which improves candidate ordering but provides little supervision over the calibration of the denoised embedding. To bridge this gap, we introduce Negative-Aware Diffusion model for TKG Extrapolation (NADEx). Specifically, NADEx encodes subject-centric histories of entities, relations and temporal intervals into sequential embeddings. NADEx perturbs the query object in the forward process and reconstructs it in reverse with a Transformer denoiser conditioned on the temporal-relational context. We further derive a cosine-alignment regularizer derived from batch-wise negative prototypes, which tightens the decision boundary against implausible candidates. Comprehensive experiments on four public TKG benchmarks demonstrate that NADEx delivers state-of-the-art performance."}

A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation.

We introduce $D^3PO$, a PPO-based framework that reorganizes multi-objective policy optimization to address these issues directly. $D^3PO$ preserves per-objective learning signals through a decomposed optimization pipeline and integrates preferences only after stabilization, enabling reliable credit assignment. In addition, a scaled diversity regularizer enforces sensitivity of policy behavior to preference changes, preventing collapse. Across standard MORL benchmarks, including high-dimensional and many-objective control tasks, $D^3PO$ consistently discovers broader and higher-quality Pareto fronts than prior single- and multi-policy methods, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art hypervolume and expected utility while using a single deployable policy."}

We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35.

Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models.

While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To our knowledge, SAGE pioneers the adaptation of geometric foundation models via Internet video, establishing a scalable paradigm for general-purpose 3D learning."}

With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), state-of-the-art performance in tabular anomaly detection has been achieved by converting tabular data into text and fine-tuning LLMs. However, these methods randomly order columns during conversion, without considering the causal relationships between them, which is crucial for accurately detecting anomalies. In this paper, we present CausalTaD, a method that injects causal knowledge into LLMs for tabular anomaly detection. We first identify the causal relationships between columns and reorder them to align with these causal relationships. This reordering can be modeled as a linear ordering problem. Since each column contributes differently to the causal relationships, we further propose a reweighting strategy to assign different weights to different columns to enhance this effect. Experiments across more than 30 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

We propose Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing. Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes."}

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone.

In this work, we rethink what PTQ calibration should align with in VLMs and propose the Token-level Importance-aware Layer-wise Quantization framework (TLQ). Guided by gradient information, we design a token-level importance integration mechanism for quantization error, and use it to construct a token-level calibration set, enabling a more fine-grained calibration strategy. Furthermore, TLQ introduces a multi-GPU, quantization-exposed layer-wise calibration scheme. This scheme keeps the layer-wise calibration procedure consistent with the true quantized inference path and distributes the complex layer-wise calibration workload across multiple RTX3090 GPUs, thereby reducing reliance on the large memory of A100 GPUs. TLQ is evaluated across two models, three model scales, and two quantization settings, consistently achieving performance improvements across all settings, indicating its strong quantization stability.

To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications. Our work highlights the need for psychological grounding and validation in AI simulations before real-world use."}

Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods."}

Controlling how LLMs internally represent concepts typically requires sophisticated methods to first identify, then intervene on the model's existing feature geometry. We bypass all of this.\n  We finetune an LLM with a simple auxiliary loss, training 16 of its 3072 residual stream dimensions to be inert interpretability flags that simply indicate what concepts are required for generation. The model reorganizes around them anyway, learning to rely on these flags during actual generation tasks. As a result, these inert flags become genuine internal features: interpretable control switches that allow us to steer generation at inference time. Why does this work? When a feature is reliably supplied at a fixed location, gradient descent gradually eliminates redundant encodings elsewhere, and the model erodes its own alternative representations. A model's efficiency pressure is a lever - exploitable to induce interpretable, controllable representations."}

We introduce CoRefine, a confidence-guided self-refinement method that achieves competitive accuracy using a fraction of the tokens via a lightweight 211k-parameter Conv1D controller atop a frozen LLM. The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers."}

In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice through the lens of heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon frequently observed in language modeling tasks. Theoretically, we introduce a novel generalized heavy-tailed noise condition that captures the behavior of LLMs more accurately than standard finite variance assumptions. Under this noise model, we establish sharp convergence rates of SignSGD and Lion for generalized smooth function classes, matching or surpassing previous best-known bounds. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to Muon and Muonlight, providing what is, to our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of matrix optimization under heavy-tailed stochasticity. These results offer a strong theoretical justification for the empirical superiority of sign-based optimizers, showcasing that they are naturally suited to handle the noisy gradients associated with heavy tails. Empirically, LLM pretraining experiments validate our theoretical insights and confirm that our proposed noise models are well-aligned with practice."}

To this end, we propose to leverage local and global density characteristics to guide the model of crowd counting for unseen surveillance scenes. Specifically, to enable the model to adapt to the varying density variations in the target scene, we propose the multiple local density learner to learn multi prototypes which represent different density distributions in the support scene. Subsequently, these multiple local density similarity matrixes are encoded. And they are utilized to guide the model in a local way. To further adapt to the global density in the target scene, the global density features are extracted from the support image, then it is used to guide the model in a global way. Experiments on three surveillance datasets shows that proposed method can adapt to the unseen surveillance scene and outperform recent state-of-the-art methods in the few-shot crowd counting."}

In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods. We further show the application of our trained PRM in test-time training, test-time scaling, and providing an early signal for training hard problems.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining.

However, conventional practices rely on random sequences of fixed length, overlooking the variable-length nature of LLM inputs. Input length directly influences the activation distribution and, consequently, the weight importance captured by the Hessian, which in turn affects quantization outcomes. As a result, Hessian estimates derived from fixed-length calibration may fail to represent the true importance of weights across diverse input scenarios. We propose MaCa (Matryoshka Calibration), a simple yet effective method for length-aware Hessian construction. MaCa (i) incorporates multi-scale sequence length information into Hessian estimation and (ii) regularizes each sequence as an independent sample, yielding a more stable and fruitful Hessian for accurate quantization. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3, LLaMA3) demonstrate that MaCa consistently improves accuracy under low bit quantization, offering a lightweight enhancement compatible with existing PTQ frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically highlight the role of multi-scale calibration in LLM quantization."}

We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

Recent studies have shown that using differentiable rewards to directly align the preference of diffusion models yields promising results. However, these methods suffer from (1) inefficient and coarse-grained optimization with (2) high memory consumption. In this work, we first theoretically and empirically identify the key reason of these limitations: the recursive dependence between different steps in the denoising trajectory. Inspired by this insight, we propose EasyTune, which fine-tunes diffusion at each denoising step rather than over the entire trajectory. This decouples the recursive dependence, allowing us to perform (1) a dense and fine-grained, and (2) memory-efficient optimization. Furthermore, the scarcity of preference motion pairs restricts the availability of motion reward model training. To this end, we further introduce a Self-refinement Preference Learning (SPL) mechanism that dynamically identifies preference pairs and conducts preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasyTune outperforms DRaFT-50 by 8.2% in alignment (MM-Dist) improvement while requiring only 31.16% of its additional memory overhead and achieving a 7.3x training speedup.

In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference Framework with Self-Search Scaling (MARTI-MARS2), which integrates policy learning with multi-agent tree search by formulating the multi-agent collaborative exploration process as a dynamic and learnable environment. By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time. We conduct extensive experiments across varied model scales (8B, 14B, and 32B) on challenging code generation benchmarks. Utilizing two collaborating 32B models, MARTI-MARS2 achieves 77.7%, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-5.1. Furthermore, MARTI-MARS2 reveals a novel scaling law: shifting from single-agent to homogeneous multi-role and ultimately to heterogeneous multi-agent paradigms progressively yields higher RL performance ceilings, robust TTS capabilities, and greater policy diversity, suggesting that policy diversity is critical for scaling intelligence via multi-agent reinforcement learning."}

However, under ultra-low-dose conditions, the sharply degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in energy-specific projections poses a significant challenge, leading to severe artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images. To address this, we propose FSP-Diff, a full-spectrum prior-enhanced dual-domain latent diffusion framework for ultra-low-dose spectral CT reconstruction. Our framework integrates three core strategies: 1) Complementary Feature Construction: We integrate direct image reconstructions with projection-domain denoised results. While the former preserves latent textural nuances amidst heavy noise, the latter provides a stable structural scaffold to balance detail fidelity and noise suppression. 2) Full-Spectrum Prior Integration: By fusing multi-energy projections into a high-SNR full-spectrum image, we establish a unified structural reference that guides the reconstruction across all energy bins. 3) Efficient Latent Diffusion Synthesis: To alleviate the high computational burden of high-dimensional spectral data, multi-path features are embedded into a compact latent space. This allows the diffusion process to facilitate interactive feature fusion in a lower-dimensional manifold, achieving accelerated reconstruction while maintaining fine-grained detail restoration. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that FSP-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency, underscoring its potential for clinically viable ultra-low-dose spectral CT imaging."}

Such loads are characterized by fast workload-driven variability and protection-driven disconnection and reconnection behavior that are not captured by conventional load models. Existing data center load modeling includes physics-based approaches, which provide interpretable structure for grid simulation, and data-driven approaches, which capture empirical workload variability from data. However, physics-based models are typically uncalibrated to facility-level operation, while trajectory alignment in data-driven methods often leads to overfitting and unrealistic dynamic behavior. To resolve these limitations, we design the framework to leverage both physics-based structure and data-driven adaptability. The physics-based structure is parameterized to enable data-driven pattern-consistent calibration from real operational data, supporting facility-level grid planning. We further show that trajectory-level alignment is limited for inherently stochastic data center loads. Therefore, we design the calibration to align temporal and statistical patterns using temporal contrastive learning (TCL). This calibration is performed locally at the facility, and only calibrated parameters are shared with utilities, preserving data privacy. The proposed load model is calibrated by real-world operational load data from the MIT Supercloud, ASU Sol, Blue Waters, and ASHRAE datasets. Then it is integrated into the ANDES platform and evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus, NPCC 140-bus, and WECC 179-bus systems.

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\\% and 79.64\\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively. Ablations further show that the refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO variants, benefits from a generative judge, and alters learning dynamics by delaying entropy collapse. These results underscore the potential of iterative, self-feedback-based RL for advancing verifiable mathematical reasoning."}

However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments."}

Ultra-sparse angular sampling, employed to reduce dose, introduces severe undersampling artifacts and inter-slice inconsistencies, compromising diagnostic reliability. Existing reconstruction methods often struggle to balance angular continuity with spatial detail fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose a Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN) for ultra-sparse-view CBCT reconstruction. Neural priors are introduced as a structural foundation to encode a continuous threedimensional attenuation representation, enabling the synthesis of physically consistent dense projections from ultra-sparse measurements. Building upon this neural-prior-based initialization, a synergistic diffusion strategy is developed, consisting of two collaborative refinement paths: a Sinogram Refinement Diffusion (Sino-RD) process that restores angular continuity and a Digital Radiography Refinement Diffusion (DR-RD) process that enforces inter-slice consistency from the projection image perspective. The outputs of the two diffusion paths are adaptively fused by the Dual-Projection Reconstruction Fusion (DPRF) module to achieve coherent volumetric reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSDN effectively suppresses artifacts and recovers fine textures under ultra-sparse-view conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques."}

However, realizing such soft policies in practice remains challenging. Existing approaches either depend on parametric policies with limited expressivity or employ diffusion-based policies whose intractable likelihoods hinder reliable entropy estimation in soft policy objectives. We address this challenge by directly realizing soft-policy sampling via Langevin dynamics driven by the action gradient of the Q-function. This perspective leads to Langevin Q-Learning (LQL), which samples actions from the target Boltzmann distribution without explicitly parameterizing the policy. However, directly applying Langevin dynamics suffers from slow mixing in high-dimensional and non-convex Q-landscapes, limiting its practical effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose Noise-Conditioned Langevin Q-Learning (NC-LQL), which integrates multi-scale noise perturbations into the value function. NC-LQL learns a noise-conditioned Q-function that induces a sequence of progressively smoothed value landscapes, enabling sampling to transition from global exploration to precise mode refinement. On OpenAI Gym MuJoCo benchmarks, NC-LQL achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL."}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."}

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art deepfake detection techniques, including human evaluation experiments against cutting-edge synthesis methods.

To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics.

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework.

Our results show that, despite visual rendering, reintegrating a text tokenizer into the architecture reintroduces the same issue that pixel-based language modeling aims to resolve, which is the tokenizer misalignment problem. Despite having lower OOV and fertility rates, we show that the Llama 2 tokenizer performs significantly worse than a custom tokenizer, with improvements of up to 30.15 chrF++.

To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation. More broadly, it offers a detailed case study and preliminary metrics for investigating how inductive biases shape generalisation in LLMs. We open-source all code, datasets and model finetunes."}

Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface.

The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video.

In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in synthesizing realistic visual data. However, they often struggle to capture complex and diverse data distributions, particularly in scenarios involving incomplete inputs or significant missing regions. These challenges arise mainly from the high computational requirements and the difficulty of modeling heterogeneous and structurally intricate data, which restrict their applicability in real-world settings. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising solution to these limitations. By dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant expert sub-networks for a given input, MoEs improve both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the integration of Deep 3D Convolutional GANs (CGANs) with a MoE framework to generate high-quality 3D models and reconstruct incomplete or damaged objects. The proposed architecture incorporates multiple generators, each specialized to capture distinct modalities within the dataset. Furthermore, an auxiliary loss-free dynamic capacity constraint (DCC) mechanism is introduced to guide the selection of categorical generators, ensuring a balance between specialization, training stability, and computational efficiency, which is critical for 3D voxel processing. We evaluated the model's ability to generate and complete shapes with missing regions of varying sizes and compared its performance with state-of-the-art approaches.

To demonstrate the practical utility of CausalCompass, we conduct extensive benchmarking of representative TSCD algorithms across eight assumption-violation scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that no single method consistently attains optimal performance across all settings.

First, YOLO 11x detects and crops human portraits frame-by-frame, and DINOv2-Base extracts visual features from the cropped regions. Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts. Each modality is first pre-trained in isolation, then fine-tuned jointly, with pseudo-labeled samples merged into the training set for further gains. Experiments demonstrate that, despite severe class imbalance, the proposed approach lifts accuracy from under 0.6 in prior work to over 0.69, establishing a new public benchmark.

Traditional machine learning (ML) models, though widely applied to PD detection, often rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture complex feature interactions. This study investigates the effectiveness of attention-based deep learning models for early PD detection using tabular biomedical data. We present a comparative evaluation of four classification models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boosting, TabNet, and SAINT, using a benchmark dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository consisting of biomedical voice measurements from PD patients and healthy controls.\n  Experimental results show that SAINT consistently outperformed all baseline models across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving a weighted precision of 0.98, weighted recall of 0.97, weighted F1-score of 0.97, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.9990, and the highest Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC). TabNet and MLP demonstrated competitive performance, while Gradient Boosting yielded the lowest overall scores. The superior performance of SAINT is attributed to its dual attention mechanism, which effectively models feature interactions within and across samples.\n  These findings demonstrate the diagnostic potential of attention-based deep learning architectures for early Parkinson's disease detection and highlight the importance of dynamic feature representation in clinical prediction tasks."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce Vectra, to the best of our knowledge, the first reference-free, MLLM-driven visual quality assessment framework for e-commerce IIMT.

In long-horizon settings, however, payoffs are shaped by latent strategic externalities that evolve over time, so myopic optimization and variation-based regret analyses can become vacuous even when the dynamics are predictable. To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known.

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition."}

In Part~I of this series, we modeled learning as a transport process in the space of parameter distributions and derived the Epistemic Speed Limit, which lower-bounds entropy production under finite-time learning.\n  In this work (Part~II), we study the consequences of this irreversibility for continual learning from a trajectory-level perspective. We show that finite dissipation constrains not only which solutions are reachable, but which learning paths remain dynamically accessible.\n  Although a continuum of task-equivalent realizations can achieve identical task performance, finite-time learning irreversibly selects among these realizations. This selection occurs through the progressive elimination of degrees of freedom that would otherwise enable structural reconfiguration. We refer to this phenomenon as \\emph{critical period closure}: beyond a certain stage of learning, transitions between compatible representations become dynamically inaccessible under any finite dissipation budget.\n  As a result, continual learning failure arises not from the absence of solutions satisfying multiple tasks, but from an irreversible loss of representational freedom induced by prior learning. This reframes catastrophic forgetting as a dynamical constraint imposed by finite-time dissipation, rather than direct task interference."}

However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems."}

Prior attempts to combine their strengths typically lead to a stability-performance trade-off. We attribute this phenomenon to a structural incompatibility within a single-stream design: Any application of the Post-Norm operation inevitably obstructs the clean identity gradient preserved by Pre-Norm. To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity. Extensive pre-training experiments on 1.3B-parameter models demonstrate that SiameseNorm exhibits exceptional optimization robustness and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry."}

Consequently, this multi-task scenario requires addressing critical questions: which tasks are similar, and how and why do they exhibit similarity? In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fréchet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting. The results demonstrate that the measure aligns with intuitive expectations of task similarity across both tabular and non-tabular data, making it a valuable tool for exploring relationships between tasks and supporting informed decision-making."}

Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill \"concept vectors\" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue). We observe that the geometric overlap between these vectors strongly correlates with specific error patterns, offering a grounded quantitative framework to understand how internal representations shape model behavior and drive visual failures."}

We present \\textit{Online Bayesian Imbalanced Learning} (OBIL), a principled framework that decouples likelihood-ratio estimation from class-prior assumptions, enabling real-time adaptation to distribution shifts without model retraining. Our approach builds on the established connection between Bregman divergences and proper scoring rules to show that deep networks trained with such losses produce posterior probability estimates from which prior-invariant likelihood ratios can be extracted. We prove that these likelihood-ratio estimates remain valid under arbitrary changes in class priors and cost structures, requiring only a threshold adjustment for optimal Bayes decisions. We derive finite-sample regret bounds demonstrating that OBIL achieves $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ regret against an oracle with perfect prior knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and medical diagnosis benchmarks under simulated deployment shifts demonstrate that OBIL maintains robust performance under severe distribution shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in F1 Score when test distributions deviate significantly from the training conditions."}

While relative camera pose embeddings defined between arbitrary view pairs offer a more robust alternative, integrating them into pre-trained video diffusion models without prohibitive training costs or architectural changes remains challenging. We introduce ReRoPE, a plug-and-play framework that incorporates relative camera information into pre-trained video diffusion models without compromising their generation capability. Our approach is based on the insight that Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in existing models underutilize their full spectral bandwidth, particularly in the low-frequency components. By seamlessly injecting relative camera pose information into these underutilized bands, ReRoPE achieves precise control while preserving strong pre-trained generative priors. We evaluate our method on both image-to-video (I2V) and video-to-video (V2V) tasks in terms of camera control accuracy and visual fidelity.

Learning in this setting proceeds by first computing (a subset of) the possible combinations of labels that satisfy the formula and then computing a loss using those combinations and the classifiers' scores. One challenge is that the space of label combinations can grow exponentially, making learning difficult. We propose a technique that prunes this space by exploiting the intuition that instances with similar latent representations are likely to share the same label. While this intuition has been widely used in weakly supervised learning, its application in our setting is challenging due to label dependencies imposed by logical constraints. We formulate the pruning process as an integer linear program that discards inconsistent label combinations while respecting logical structure. Our approach, CLIPPER, is orthogonal to existing training algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Across 16 benchmarks over complex neurosymbolic tasks, we demonstrate that CLIPPER boosts the performance of state-of-the-art neurosymbolic engines like Scallop, Dolphin, and ISED by up to 48%, 53%, and 8%, leading to state-of-the-art accuracies."}

In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs."}

This works in static regimes but breaks under distributional shift, task permutation, and continual learning, where even mild topological changes can invalidate learned solutions and trigger catastrophic forgetting. We propose Metric-Topology Factorization (MTF) as a unifying geometric principle: intelligence is not navigation through a fixed maze, but the ability to reshape representational geometry so desired behaviors become stable attractors. Learning corresponds to metric contraction (a controlled deformation of Riemannian structure), while task identity and environmental variation are encoded topologically and stored separately in memory. We show any fixed metric is geometrically incomplete: for any local metric representation, some topological transformations make it singular or incoherent, implying an unavoidable stability-plasticity tradeoff for weight-based systems. MTF resolves this by factorizing stable topology from plastic metric warps, enabling rapid adaptation via geometric switching rather than re-optimization. Building on this, we introduce the Topological Urysohn Machine (TUM), implementing MTF through memory-amortized metric inference (MAMI): spectral task signatures index amortized metric transformations, letting a single learned geometry be reused across permuted, reflected, or parity-altered environments. This explains robustness to task reordering, resistance to catastrophic forgetting, and generalization across transformations that defeat conventional continual learning methods (e.g., EWC)."}

This work compares standard CNNs (ConvNet, VGG, ResNet18) with their ANFIS-augmented counterparts on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under gradient-based (PGD) and gradient-free (Square) attacks. Results show that ANFIS integration does not consistently improve clean accuracy and has architecture-dependent effects on robustness: ResNet18-ANFIS exhibits improved adversarial robustness, while VGG-ANFIS often underperforms its baseline. These findings suggest that neuro-fuzzy augmentation can enhance robustness in specific architectures but is not universally beneficial."}

We characterize the geometry of correctness representations across 9 models from 5 architecture families. The structure is simple: the discriminative signal occupies 3-8 dimensions, performance degrades with additional dimensions, and no nonlinear classifier improves over linear separation. Centroid distance in the low-dimensional subspace matches trained probe performance (0.90 AUC), enabling few-shot detection: on GPT-2, 25 labeled examples achieve 89% of full-data accuracy. We validate causally through activation steering: the learned direction produces 10.9 percentage point changes in error rates while random directions show no effect. Internal probes achieve 0.80-0.97 AUC; output-based methods (P(True), semantic entropy) achieve only 0.44-0.64 AUC. The correctness signal exists internally but is not expressed in outputs. That centroid distance matches probe performance indicates class separation is a mean shift, making detection geometric rather than learned."}

We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision.

Despite this progress, it remains unclear which compositional problems are learnable in this setting using outcome-level feedback alone. In this work, we theoretically study the learnability of compositional problems in autoregressive models under RLVR training. We identify a quantity that we call the task-advantage ratio, a joint property of the compositional problem and the base model, that characterizes which tasks and compositions are learnable from outcome-level feedback. On the positive side, using this characterization, we show that compositional problems where correct intermediate steps provide a clear advantage are efficiently learnable with RLVR. We also analyze how such an advantage naturally arises in different problems. On the negative side, when the structural advantage is not present, RLVR may converge to suboptimal compositions. We prove that, in some cases, the quality of the base model determines if such an advantage exists and whether RLVR will converge to a suboptimal solution. We hope our analysis can provide a principled theoretical understanding of when and why RLVR succeeds and when it does not."}

However, standard approaches typically rely on activation addition, a geometric operation that inevitably alters the magnitude of hidden representations. This raises concerns about representation collapse and degradation of open-ended generation capabilities. In this work, we explore Spherical Steering, a training-free primitive that resolves this trade-off through activation rotation. Rather than shifting activations with a fixed vector, our method rotates them along a geodesic toward a target direction, guiding the activation toward the target concept while preserving the integrity of the signal. To further enhance adaptivity, we incorporate a confidence gate that dynamically modulates steering strength based on input uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that Spherical Steering significantly outperforms addition-based baselines (notably by +10% on TruthfulQA, COPA, and Storycloze), while simultaneously maintaining the model's general open-ended generation quality. This work highlights the value of geometric consistency, suggesting that norm-preserving rotation is a robust and effective primitive for precise inference-time control."}

To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail.

Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget. We test our approach in two question answering datasets and one binary sentiment classification dataset: MEDMCQA, MMLU, and IMDB movie reviews. Across all datasets, we observe that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines under the same query budget."}

We propose TSR, which brings two-sided low-rank communication to Adam-family updates (TSR-Adam) by synchronizing a compact core $U^\\top G V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$, reducing the dominant per-step payload from $O(mn)$ to $O(r^2)$ while keeping moment states in low-dimensional cores.

We additionally extend low-rank communication to embedding gradients with embedding-specific ranks and refresh schedules, yielding additional communication and memory savings over keeping embeddings dense. Across pretraining from 60M to 1B model scales, TSR-Adam reduces average communicated bytes per step by $13\\times$, and on GLUE fine-tuning it reduces communication by $25\\times$, while achieving comparable performance; we further provide a theoretical stationarity analysis for the proposed update.

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions."}

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens.

Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve."}

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment."}

It not only enhance downstream applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal in various horizontal domains, but also exhibit broad applicability across vertical domains. Despite the growing popularity and application of MoE models across various domains, there lacks a systematic exploration of recent advancements of MoE in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE suffer from limitations such as lack coverage or none extensively exploration of key areas. This survey seeks to fill these gaps. In this paper, Firstly, we examine the foundational principles of MoE, with an in-depth exploration of its core components-the routing network and expert network. Subsequently, we extend beyond the centralized paradigm to the decentralized paradigm, which unlocks the immense untapped potential of decentralized infrastructure, enables democratization of MoE development for broader communities, and delivers greater scalability and cost-efficiency. Furthermore we focus on exploring its vertical domain applications. Finally, we also identify key challenges and promising future research directions.

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off.

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute.

Key results on 1 million synthetic maze pairs include:\n  - 192x reduction in training loss over 100 epochs\n  - 22.7x improvement in L2 distance to ground truth\n  - Only 10 Euler steps required (vs. 100-1000 for typical diffusion models)\n  Quantitative analysis reveals a striking phase transition phenomenon: the solution remains invisible for 68% of the transformation (zero recall), then emerges abruptly at t=0.70 within just 2% of the process.

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility."}

Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called \"boundary offset encodings,\" aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator.

Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps.

However, this paradigm compels the model to learn the conditional expectation, which may yield misleading predictions when the underlying posterior distribution is multimodal or heavy-tailed -- a common phenomenon in pathological scenarios.

For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels.

In this paper, we view latent chain-of-thought as a manipulable causal process in representation space by modeling latent steps as variables in a structural causal model (SCM) and analyzing their effects through step-wise $\\mathrm{do}$-interventions. We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment. These results motivate mode-conditional and stability-aware analyses -- and corresponding training/decoding objectives -- as more reliable tools for interpreting and improving latent reasoning systems."}

Standard reinitialization methods, which reinitialize weights toward their original values, are widely used but difficult to tune: conservative reinitializations fail to restore plasticity, while aggressive ones erase useful knowledge. We propose FIRE, a principled reinitialization method that explicitly balances the stability-plasticity tradeoff. FIRE quantifies stability through Squared Frobenius Error (SFE), measuring proximity to past weights, and plasticity through Deviation from Isometry (DfI), reflecting weight isotropy. The reinitialization point is obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem, minimizing SFE subject to DfI being zero, which is efficiently approximated by Newton-Schulz iteration. FIRE is evaluated on continual visual learning (CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18), language modeling (OpenWebText with GPT-0.1B), and reinforcement learning (HumanoidBench with SAC and Atari games with DQN).

However, existing visual language models (VLMs) have very weak capabilities in spatial reasoning due to the lack of knowledge about 3D spatial information, especially when the reasoning task involve complex spatial relations across multiple video frames. In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \\emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks. Our basic idea is to integrate fragmented spatial information from multiple frames into a unified space representation of global semantic map, and further guide the VLM's spatial reasoning over the semantic map via a visual prompt. Experiment results show that our technique can greatly enhance the accuracy of cross-frame spatial reasoning on resource-constrained embodied AI devices, over reasoning tasks with diverse types and complexities."}

Although there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SAM2, most of them focus on retraining a lightweight backbone, with little exploration into post-training acceleration. In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection. With negligible additional parameters and minimal training overhead, Efficient-SAM2 delivers 1.68x speedup on SAM2.1-L model with only 1.0% accuracy drop on SA-V test set."}

To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known. Experiments in 6-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em and competitive Pokemon show consistent improvements in long-term return over strong LLM and RL baselines, and graceful degradation under controlled prediction noise."}

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{WorldEdit}, a dataset specifically designed to enable world-driven image editing. WorldEdit consists of high-quality editing samples, guided by paraphrased instructions that align with real-world causal logic. Furthermore, we provide \\textbf{WorldEdit-Test} for evaluating the existing model's performance on causal editing scenarios. With WorldEdit, we use a two-stage training framework for fine-tuning models like Bagel, integrating with a causal verification reward. Our results show that the proposed dataset and methods significantly narrow the gap with GPT-4o and Nano-Banana, demonstrating competitive performance not only in instruction following but also in knowledge plausibility, where many open-source systems typically struggle."}

As RL is increasingly applied to settings such as verifiable rewards and multi-objective alignment, RMs are expected to encode more complex and multifaceted preference distributions. However, classifier RMs remain static once trained, limiting their adaptability at test time. We propose Variational In-Context Reward Modeling (ICRM), a novel Bayesian reward modeling objective that enables test-time steerability via in-context preference demonstrations. ICRM casts reward modeling as amortized variational inference over a latent preference probability under the Bradley-Terry model using a conjugate Beta prior. We show that ICRM adapt to unseen preference distributions at test time for both single and multi-objective settings. With more in-context demonstrations, ICRM gains 34% accuracy on SafeRLHF and 9% accuracy on RM-Bench in the single-objective setting, while widening the Pareto frontier with a 4% gain in hypervolume on helpfulness and refusal benchmarks. We further study the practical applicability of ICRM for RL training, showing that it can effectively encode verifiable rewards by outperforming a conventional RM in math reasoning. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees that the variational objective admits a global interior optimum with finite confidence, and we analyze how KL regularization mitigates reward over-optimization."}

This is primarily due to the non-differentiable nature of mainstream event representations, which hinders the extension of gradient-based attack methods. In this paper, we propose MA-ADV, a novel \\textbf{M}otion-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{Adv}ersarial framework.

MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search. Extensive experimental results validate that MA-ADV ensures a 100\\% attack success rate with minimal perturbation cost, and also demonstrate enhanced robustness against defenses, underscoring the critical security challenges facing future event-based perception systems."}

We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\\times$ for BF16, representing a \\textbf{6--48$\\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions.

Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real model weights (LLaMA-7B, GPT-2, ViT) demonstrate V-ABFT's effectiveness across diverse distributions.

While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D."}

The idea is to faithfully re-parameterize a Transformer as a RASP program and then apply causal interventions to discover a small sufficient sub-program. In experiments on small Transformers trained on algorithmic and formal language tasks, we show that our method often recovers simple and interpretable RASP programs from length-generalizing transformers.

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning."}

The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification.

In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends.

To address this, we propose Epigraph-Guided Flow Matching (EpiFlow), a framework that formulates safe offline RL as a state-constrained optimal control problem to co-optimize safety and performance. We learn a feasibility value function derived from an epigraph reformulation of the optimal control problem, thereby avoiding the decoupled objectives or post-hoc filtering common in prior work. Policies are synthesized by reweighting the behavior distribution based on this epigraph value function and fitting a generative policy via flow matching, enabling efficient, distribution-consistent sampling.

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives."}

In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

Among many approaches to mitigate the inefficiencies of sequential token-by-token generation, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique. However, SD at the edge is hindered by two major challenges: (1) integrating SD into a compiler-based workflow without sacrificing performance or programmability, and (2) exploiting the heterogeneous compute resources of modern SoCs through carefully designed partitioning strategies. This work addresses these challenges by using an analytical cost model that explores heterogeneous hardware configurations and guides coarse-grained partitioning of LLM subgraphs, particularly with edge-typical short input sequence lengths. The cost model predicts when speculative sampling and heterogeneous execution are jointly beneficial and is validated on an edge device featuring a hexacore Cortex-A CPU and a Mali GPU, revealing up to 1.68$\\times$ speedup for translation tasks, closely matching analytic expectations."}

In many applications, the parameters being tuned come with a carefully engineered default configuration, and practitioners only want to deviate from this default when necessary. Standard BO, however, does not aim to minimize deviation from the default and, in practice, often pushes weakly relevant parameters to the boundary of the search space. This makes it difficult to distinguish between important and spurious changes and increases the burden of vetting recommendations when the optimization objective omits relevant operational considerations. We introduce BONSAI, a default-aware BO policy that prunes low-impact deviations from a default configuration while explicitly controlling the loss in acquisition value. BONSAI is compatible with a variety of acquisition functions, including expected improvement and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We theoretically bound the regret incurred by BONSAI, showing that, under certain conditions, it enjoys the same no-regret property as vanilla GP-UCB. Across many real-world applications, we empirically find that BONSAI substantially reduces the number of non-default parameters in recommended configurations while maintaining competitive optimization performance, with little effect on wall time."}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."}

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts."}

However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability.\n  To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems."}

Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope.

CASTE dynamically balances spatial and temporal relations by evaluating frame-level audio-visual agreement, ensuring that key information is captured from both preceding and subsequent frames under misalignment. CASE injects cross-modal semantic guidance into selected spatio-temporal positions, leveraging high-level semantic cues to further alleviate misalignment. In addition, we design lightweight objectives, caption-to-modality InfoNCE, visual-audio consistency, and entropy regularization to guide token selection and strengthen cross-modal semantic alignment.

In this paper, we devise a novel algorithmic and theoretical framework to approximate an unknown probability distribution $\\mathbb{P}$ from a finite set of samples by an approximate discrete distribution $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while bounding the Wasserstein distance between $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$. Our framework leverages optimal transport, nonlinear optimization, and concentration inequalities.

This enables us to develop intelligent clustering algorithms to optimally find the support of $\\widehat{\\mathbb{P}}$ while minimizing the Wasserstein distance error.

In this paradigm, increasing the number of tokens is a common approach to improving motion reconstruction quality, but more tokens make it more difficult for generative models to learn. To maintain high reconstruction quality while reducing generation complexity, we propose leveraging language to achieve efficient motion tokenization, which we term Language-Guided Tokenization (LG-Tok). LG-Tok aligns natural language with motion at the tokenization stage, yielding compact, high-level semantic representations. This approach not only strengthens both tokenization and detokenization but also simplifies the learning of generative models. Furthermore, existing tokenizers predominantly adopt convolutional architectures, whose local receptive fields struggle to support global language guidance. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based Tokenizer that leverages attention mechanisms to enable effective alignment between language and motion. Additionally, we design a language-drop scheme, in which language conditions are randomly removed during training, enabling the detokenizer to support language-free guidance during generation. On the HumanML3D and Motion-X generation benchmarks, LG-Tok achieves Top-1 scores of 0.542 and 0.582, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (MARDM: 0.500 and 0.528), and with FID scores of 0.057 and 0.088, respectively, versus 0.114 and 0.147.

To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity.

Existing bandit-based methods treat time merely as a timestamp, neglecting its explicit relationship with user preferences and leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, online learning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration-exploitation during the early online phase. To address these issues, we propose HyperBandit+, a novel contextual bandit policy that integrates a time-aware hypernetwork to adapt to time-varying user preferences and employs a large language model-assisted warm-start mechanism (LLM Start) to enhance exploration-exploitation efficiency in the early online phase. Specifically, HyperBandit+ leverages a neural network that takes time features as input and generates parameters for estimating time-varying rewards by capturing the correlation between time and user preferences. Additionally, the LLM Start mechanism employs multi-step data augmentation to simulate realistic interaction data for effective offline learning, providing warm-start parameters for the bandit policy in the early online phase. To meet real-time streaming recommendation demands, we adopt low-rank factorization to reduce hypernetwork training complexity. Theoretically, we rigorously establish a sublinear regret upper bound that accounts for both the hypernetwork and the LLM warm-start mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperBandit+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accumulated rewards."}

In Alzheimers disease (AD), multimodal neuroimaging offers complementary signals but VAE-based normative models often (i) fit the healthy reference distribution imperfectly, inflating false positives, and (ii) use posterior aggregation (e.g., PoE/MoE) that can yield weak multimodal fusion in the shared latent space. We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts. Deviation maps highlight region-level patterns aligned with established AD-related changes. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of training objectives that prioritize reference-distribution fidelity and robust multimodal posterior aggregation for normative modeling, with implications for deviation-based analysis across multimodal clinical data."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a similar flexibility in adopting different personas and behaviors. Existing approaches, however, typically adapt such behavior through external knowledge such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning. We ask: do LLMs really need external context or parameters to adapt to different behaviors, or do they already have such knowledge embedded in their parameters? In this work, we show that LLMs already contain persona-specialized subnetworks in their parameter space. Using small calibration datasets, we identify distinct activation signatures associated with different personas. Guided by these statistics, we develop a masking strategy that isolates lightweight persona subnetworks. Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing subnetwork from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? To further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free and relies solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that require external knowledge while being more efficient. Our findings suggest that diverse human-like behaviors are not merely induced in LLMs, but are already embedded in their parameter space, pointing toward a new perspective on controllable and interpretable personalization in large language models."}

To address these issues, we propose GeoEdit, a framework that leverages in-context generation through a diffusion transformer module, which integrates geometric transformations for precise object edits. Moreover, we introduce Effects-Sensitive Attention, which enhances the modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects for improved realism. To further support training, we construct RS-Objects, a large-scale geometric editing dataset containing over 120,000 high-quality image pairs, enabling the model to learn precise geometric editing while generating realistic lighting and shadows.

In practice, domain knowledge evolves continuously through new regulations, products, services, and interaction patterns. Retraining or fine-tuning LLMs for every new instance is computationally infeasible. Additionally, real-world environments also exhibit temporal dynamics with shifting data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining. In response, we introduce Online Domain-aware Decoding framework (ODD). ODD performs probability-level fusion between a base LLM and a prefix-tree prior, guided by adaptive confidence modulation using disagreement and continuity signals. Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics. It yields an absolute ROUGE-L gain of 0.065 and a 13.6% relative improvement in Cosine Similarity over the best baseline.

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes."}

This repurposes neural MI estimators for dimensionality estimation. We show that standard neural estimators with separable/bilinear critics systematically inflate the inferred dimension, and we address this by introducing a hybrid critic that retains an explicit dimensional bottleneck while allowing flexible nonlinear cross-view interactions, thereby preserving the latent geometry. We further propose a one-shot protocol that reads off the effective dimension from a single over-parameterized hybrid model, without sweeping over bottleneck sizes. We validate the approach on synthetic problems with known task-relevant dimension. We extend the approach to intrinsic dimensionality by constructing paired views of a single dataset, enabling comparison with classical geometric dimension estimators. In noisy regimes where those estimators degrade, our approach remains reliable. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the method on multiple physics datasets."}

Yet in implicit-feedback, a single global temperature and equal treatment of uniformly sampled negatives can lead to brittle training, because sampled sets may contain varying degrees of relevant or informative competitors. The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances. This helps explain the empirically observed improvements in accuracy and robustness."}

We present \\textit{Online Bayesian Imbalanced Learning} (OBIL), a principled framework that decouples likelihood-ratio estimation from class-prior assumptions, enabling real-time adaptation to distribution shifts without model retraining. Our approach builds on the established connection between Bregman divergences and proper scoring rules to show that deep networks trained with such losses produce posterior probability estimates from which prior-invariant likelihood ratios can be extracted. We prove that these likelihood-ratio estimates remain valid under arbitrary changes in class priors and cost structures, requiring only a threshold adjustment for optimal Bayes decisions. We derive finite-sample regret bounds demonstrating that OBIL achieves $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ regret against an oracle with perfect prior knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and medical diagnosis benchmarks under simulated deployment shifts demonstrate that OBIL maintains robust performance under severe distribution shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in F1 Score when test distributions deviate significantly from the training conditions."}

A common approach is to use predictive distributions from Bayesian or approximation methods and additively decompose uncertainty into aleatoric (i.e., data-related) and epistemic (i.e., model-related) components. However, additive decomposition has recently been questioned, with evidence that it breaks down when using finite-ensemble sampling and/or mismatched predictive distributions. This paper introduces Variance-Gated Ensembles (VGE), an intuitive, differentiable framework that injects epistemic sensitivity via a signal-to-noise gate computed from ensemble statistics. VGE provides: (i) a Variance-Gated Margin Uncertainty (VGMU) score that couples decision margins with ensemble predictive variance; and (ii) a Variance-Gated Normalization (VGN) layer that generalizes the variance-gated uncertainty mechanism to training via per-class, learnable normalization of ensemble member probabilities. We derive closed-form vector-Jacobian products enabling end-to-end training through ensemble sample mean and variance. VGE matches or exceeds state-of-the-art information-theoretic baselines while remaining computationally efficient.

Existing solutions relying on fixed-size memory or naive compression often suffer from context loss or memory overflow, limiting their effectiveness in long-form, real-time scenarios. We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on StreamingBench demonstrate that Vista achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a strong baseline for real-world streaming video understanding."}

Existing watermarks insert a signal into generated tokens that either flags LM-generated text (zero-bit watermarking) or encodes more complex messages (multi-bit watermarking). Though a number of recent multi-bit watermarks insert several bits into text without perturbing average next-token predictions, they largely extend design principles from the zero-bit setting, such as encoding a single bit per token. Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel. In practice, ArcMark outperforms competing multi-bit watermarks in terms of bit rate per token and detection accuracy. Our work demonstrates that LM watermarking is fundamentally a channel coding problem, paving the way for principled coding-theoretic approaches to watermark design."}

This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset.

Centroid distance in the low-dimensional subspace matches trained probe performance (0.90 AUC), enabling few-shot detection: on GPT-2, 25 labeled examples achieve 89% of full-data accuracy.

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs."}

In this work, we explore Spherical Steering, a training-free primitive that resolves this trade-off through activation rotation. Rather than shifting activations with a fixed vector, our method rotates them along a geodesic toward a target direction, guiding the activation toward the target concept while preserving the integrity of the signal. To further enhance adaptivity, we incorporate a confidence gate that dynamically modulates steering strength based on input uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that Spherical Steering significantly outperforms addition-based baselines (notably by +10% on TruthfulQA, COPA, and Storycloze), while simultaneously maintaining the model's general open-ended generation quality.

A critical question is whether statistically detectable heterogeneity translates into improved treatment decisions -- these are distinct questions that can yield contradictory answers. We present a modular causal machine learning framework that evaluates each question separately: permutation importance identifies which features predict heterogeneity, best linear predictor (BLP) testing assesses statistical significance, and doubly robust policy evaluation measures whether acting on the heterogeneity improves patient outcomes. We apply this framework to patient-level data from the UNIFI maintenance trial of ustekinumab in ulcerative colitis, comparing placebo, standard-dose ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and dose-intensified ustekinumab every 8 weeks, using cross-fitted X-learner models with baseline demographics, medication history, week-8 clinical scores, laboratory biomarkers, and video-derived endoscopic features. BLP testing identified strong associations between endoscopic features and treatment effect heterogeneity for ustekinumab versus placebo, yet doubly robust policy evaluation showed no improvement in expected remission from incorporating endoscopic features, and out-of-fold multi-arm evaluation showed worse performance. Diagnostic comparison of prognostic contribution against policy value revealed that endoscopic scores behaved as disease severity markers -- improving outcome prediction in untreated patients but adding noise to treatment selection -- while clinical variables (fecal calprotectin, age, CRP) captured the decision-relevant variation. These results demonstrate that causal machine learning applications to clinical trials should include policy-level evaluation alongside heterogeneity testing."}

We propose Laplacian-LoRA, a simple and interpretable low-rank spectral adaptation of standard GCNs. Rather than redesigning message passing, Laplacian-LoRA introduces a learnable, spectrally anchored correction to the fixed Laplacian propagation operator, selectively weakening contraction while preserving stability and the low-pass inductive bias. Across multiple benchmark datasets and depths, Laplacian-LoRA consistently delays the onset of oversmoothing, extending the effective depth of GCNs by up to a factor of two. Embedding variance diagnostics confirm that these gains arise from delayed representational collapse, while learned spectral analysis demonstrates that the correction is smooth, bounded, and well behaved.

Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fréchet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms."}

However, existing hallucination standards and evaluation metrics focus primarily on factual correctness, treating all errors as equally severe. This obscures clinically relevant failure modes, particularly when models generate unsupported but actionable medical language. We propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework that quantifies hallucinations through the presence of risk-bearing language, including treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-risk medications. Rather than assessing clinical correctness, our approach evaluates the potential impact of hallucinated content if acted upon. We further combine risk scoring with a relevance measure to identify high-risk, low-grounding failures. We apply this framework to three instruction-tuned language models using controlled patient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behavior exhibit substantially different risk profiles and that standard evaluation metrics fail to capture these distinctions. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating risk sensitivity into hallucination evaluation and suggest that evaluation validity is critically dependent on task and prompt design."}

As such data often co-evolves with multiple variables interacting with each other, estimating the time-varying dependencies between variables (i.e., the dynamic network structure) has become crucial for accurate modeling. However, real-world data is often represented as tensor time series with multiple modes, resulting in large, entangled networks that are hard to interpret and computationally intensive to estimate. In this paper, we propose Kronecker Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (KTVGL), a method designed for modeling tensor time series. Our approach estimates mode-specific dynamic networks in a Kronecker product form, thereby avoiding overly complex entangled structures and producing interpretable modeling results. Moreover, the partitioned network structure prevents the exponential growth of computational time with data dimension. In addition, our method can be extended to stream algorithms, making the computational time independent of the sequence length. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed method achieves higher edge estimation accuracy than existing methods while requiring less computation time. To further demonstrate its practical value, we also present a case study using real-world data. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Higashiguchi-Shingo/KTVGL."}

Users often employ follow-up questions to refine their intent, expecting LLMs to adapt dynamically. However, recent research reveals that LLMs suffer a substantial performance drop in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn interactions with fully specified instructions, a phenomenon termed ``Lost in Conversation'' (LiC). While this prior work attributes LiC to model unreliability, we argue that the root cause lies in an intent alignment gap rather than intrinsic capability deficits. In this paper, we first demonstrate that LiC is not a failure of model capability but rather a breakdown in interaction between users and LLMs. We theoretically show that scaling model size or improving training alone cannot resolve this gap, as it arises from structural ambiguity in conversational context rather than representational limitations. To address this, we propose to decouple intent understanding from task execution through a Mediator-Assistant architecture. By utilizing an experience-driven Mediator to explicate user inputs into explicit, well-structured instructions based on historical interaction patterns, our approach effectively bridges the gap between vague user intent and model interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly mitigates performance degradation in multi-turn conversations across diverse LLMs."}

To adapt these components to thermal data, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline to enhance input suitability and modify core SLAM modules to handle sparse and outlier-prone feature matches.

However, we argue that the dominant Supervised Learning (SL) training paradigm suffers from a fundamental objective mismatch: minimizing imitation loss (e.g., cross-entropy) does not guarantee solution cost minimization. We dissect this mismatch into two deficiencies: Decoder-Blindness (being oblivious to the non-differentiable decoding process) and Cost-Blindness (prioritizing structural imitation over solution quality). We empirically demonstrate that these intrinsic flaws impose a hard performance ceiling. To overcome this limitation, we propose CADO (Cost-Aware Diffusion models for Optimization), a streamlined Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that formulates the diffusion denoising process as an MDP to directly optimize the post-decoded solution cost. We introduce Label-Centered Reward, which repurposes ground-truth labels as unbiased baselines rather than imitation targets, and Hybrid Fine-Tuning for parameter-efficient adaptation. CADO achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, validating that objective alignment is essential for unlocking the full potential of heatmap-based solvers."}

Hence, we propose CLARITY that dynamically adapts its fusion strategy to the detected scene condition. Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects.

In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods."}

To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process.

To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking."}

We, therefore, propose a novel application of conformal prediction to produce distribution-free uncertainty quantification over the function spaces mapped by neural operators. We then demonstrate how such prediction regions enable a formal regret characterization if leveraged in downstream robust decision-making tasks. We further demonstrate how such posited robust decision-making tasks can be efficiently solved using an infinite-dimensional generalization of Danskin's Theorem and calculus of variations and empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over more restrictive modeling paradigms, such as Gaussian Processes, across several engineering tasks."}

Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLAG-4D achieves higher-fidelity and more temporally coherent reconstructions with finer detail preservation than state-of-the-art methods."}

We show that the softmax function corresponds to the unique thermodynamic equilibrium state that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy of the information gas. In addition, we identify the query-key interaction as an electrodynamic coupling between an external field and an intrinsic dipole moment. This theory establishes the first law of information thermodynamics, unifying inference (mechanical work) and learning (chemical evolution). It also explains emergent phenomena, such as scaling laws and grokking, as phase transitions characterized by the divergence of specific heat.

In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction.

While deep learning shows promise in processing B-rep models, existing methods suffer from a representation gap: continuous approaches offer analytical precision but are visually abstract, whereas discrete methods provide intuitive clarity at the expense of geometric precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce Brep2Shape, a novel self-supervised pre-training method designed to align abstract boundary representations with intuitive shape representations. Our method employs a geometry-aware task where the model learns to predict dense spatial points from parametric Bézier control points, enabling the network to better understand physical manifolds derived from abstract coefficients. To enhance this alignment, we propose a Dual Transformer backbone with parallel streams that independently encode surface and curve tokens to capture their distinct geometric properties. Moreover, the topology attention is integrated to model the interdependencies between surfaces and curves, thereby maintaining topological consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Brep2Shape offers significant scalability, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and faster convergence across various downstream tasks."}

Given two input images, our model produces diverse, visually coherent compositions that reveal latent relationships between inputs, without relying on user-specified text prompts. Our approach is feed-forward, trained on synthetic triplets of decomposed visual aspects derived entirely through visual means: we use CLIP Sparse Autoencoders to extract editing directions in CLIP latent space and isolate concept pairs. By removing the reliance on language and enabling fast, intuitive recombination, our method supports visual ideation at the early and ambiguous stages of creative work."}

Yet, the mechanisms underlying their training performance and generalization remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide several insights into such fine-tuning through the lens of linearization. Fine-tuned models are often implicitly encouraged to remain close to the pretrained model. By making this explicit, using an Euclidean distance inductive bias in parameter space, we show that fine-tuning dynamics become equivalent to learning with the positive-definite neural tangent kernel (NTK). We specifically analyze how close the fully linear and the linearized fine-tuning optimizations are, based on the strength of the regularization. This allows us to be pragmatic about how good a model linearization is when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When linearization is a good model, our findings reveal a strong correlation between the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK and the performance of model adaptation. Motivated by this, we give spectral perturbation bounds on the NTK induced by the choice of layers selected for fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theory on Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on LLMs. These insights not only characterize fine-tuning but also have the potential to enhance PEFT techniques, paving the way to better informed and more nimble adaptation in LLMs."}

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data. PAR is compatible with multiple BC regularization paradigms. Extensive experiments across offline RL benchmarks show that PAR consistently improves performance and approaches state-of-the-art when combined with the basic TD3+BC."}

We further observe that the resulting high-dimensional, information-rich latent make decoders sensitive to latent perturbations, causing severe artifacts when decoding generated latent and consequently degrading generation quality. Our analysis suggests that this sensitivity primarily stems from excessive decoder responses along directions off the data manifold. Building on these insights, we propose fine-tuning the decoder to increase its robustness and smoothing the generated latent via controlled noise injection, thereby enhancing generation quality. Experiments demonstrate that LV-RAE significantly improves reconstruction fidelity while preserving the semantic abstraction and achieving strong generative quality.

However, existing ICRL methods rely on explicit reward signals during pretraining, which limits their applicability when rewards are ambiguous, hard to specify, or costly to obtain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new learning paradigm, In-Context Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (ICPRL), in which both pretraining and deployment rely solely on preference feedback, eliminating the need for reward supervision. We study two variants that differ in the granularity of feedback: Immediate Preference-based RL (I-PRL) with per-step preferences, and Trajectory Preference-based RL (T-PRL) with trajectory-level comparisons. We first show that supervised pretraining, a standard approach in ICRL, remains effective under preference-only context datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of in-context reinforcement learning using only preference signals. To further improve data efficiency, we introduce alternative preference-native frameworks for I-PRL and T-PRL that directly optimize TM policies from preference data without requiring reward signals nor optimal action labels.Experiments on dueling bandits, navigation, and continuous control tasks demonstrate that ICPRL enables strong in-context generalization to unseen tasks, achieving performance comparable to ICRL methods trained with full reward supervision."}

We further derive a simple formula in terms of these statistics that predicts data-limited neural scaling exponents from first principles without any free parameters or synthetic data models.

In this work, we investigate the friction between global and local feature learning under different pre-training strategies by analyzing the interactions between class and patch tokens. Our analysis reveals that standard normalization layers introduce an implicit differentiation between these token types. Building on this insight, we propose specialized processing paths that selectively disentangle the computational flow of class and patch tokens, particularly within normalization layers and early query-key-value projections. This targeted specialization leads to significantly improved patch representation quality for dense prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate segmentation performance gains of over 2 mIoU points on standard benchmarks, while maintaining strong classification accuracy. The proposed modifications introduce only an 8% increase in parameters, with no additional computational overhead. Through comprehensive ablations, we provide insights into which architectural components benefit most from specialization and how our approach generalizes across model scales and learning frameworks."}

Although Decision Transformers provide powerful sequence modeling capabilities, applying them to this constrained setting encounters two challenges: 1) standard Return-to-Go conditioning causes state aliasing by neglecting the cost dimension, preventing precise resource pacing; and 2) standard regression forces the policy to mimic average historical behaviors, thereby limiting the capacity to optimize performance toward the constraint boundary. To address these challenges, we propose PRO-Bid, a constraint-aware generative auto-bidding framework based on two synergistic mechanisms: 1) Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation (CDPR) decomposes global constraints into recursive cost and value contexts to restore resource perception, while reweighting trajectories based on the Pareto frontier to focus on high-efficiency data; and 2) Counterfactual Regret Optimization (CRO) facilitates active improvement by utilizing a global outcome predictor to identify superior counterfactual actions. By treating these high-utility outcomes as weighted regression targets, the model transcends historical averages to approach the optimal constraint boundary. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and online A/B tests demonstrate that PRO-Bid achieves superior constraint satisfaction and value acquisition compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

Unlike vision-based approaches such as two-dimensional deep residual networks that treat Channel State Information (CSI) as images, WiFlow employs an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures spatio-temporal features of CSI using temporal and asymmetric convolutions, preserving the original sequential structure of signals. It then refines keypoint features of human bodies to be tracked and capture their structural dependencies via axial attention. The decoder subsequently maps the encoded high-dimensional features into keypoint coordinates. Trained on a self-collected dataset of 360,000 synchronized CSI-pose samples from 5 subjects performing continuous sequences of 8 daily activities, WiFlow achieves a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 97.00% at a threshold of 20% (PCK@20) and 99.48% at PCK@50, with a mean per-joint position error of 0.008m.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments. These theoretical insights clarify empirical inconsistencies and provide practical criteria for deploying MARL strategies effectively in complex LLM scenarios."}

Meanwhile, a comprehensive data pipeline consisting of audio-video captioning, quality control, etc., is carefully designed to collect high-quality finetuning data. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to perform a comprehensive model test and comparison. After continue pretraining and finetuning on million-level high-quality data, ALIVE demonstrates outstanding performance, consistently outperforming open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions.

However, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the system is challenging due to the presence of potentially malicious or faulty nodes that can degrade the model's performance. This paper proposes a novel trust-based incentive mechanism designed to evaluate and reward the quality of contributions in FL systems. By dynamically assessing trust scores based on fac-tors such as data quality, model accuracy, consistency, and contribution fre-quency, the system encourages honest participation and penalizes unreliable or malicious behavior. These trust scores form the basis of an incentive mechanism that rewards high-trust nodes with greater participation opportunities and penal-ties for low-trust participants. We further explore the integration of blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the trust evaluation and incentive distribution processes, ensuring transparency and decentralization. Our proposed theoretical framework aims to create a more robust, fair, and transparent FL eco-system, reducing the risks posed by untrustworthy participants."}

To disentangle the two, we introduce Gaussian Match-and-Copy (GMC), a minimalist benchmark that isolates long-range retrieval through pure second-order correlation signals. Numerical investigations show that this task retains key qualitative aspects of how Transformers develop match-and-copy circuits in practice, and separates architectures by their retrieval capabilities. We also analyze the optimization dynamics in a simplified attention setting. Although many solutions are a priori possible under a regression objective, including ones that do not implement retrieval, we identify an implicit-bias regime in which gradient descent drives the parameters to diverge while their direction aligns with the max-margin separator, yielding hard match selection. We prove this max-margin alignment for GD trajectories that reach vanishing empirical loss under explicit technical conditions."}

Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.\n  Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.\n  Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists."}

We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term."}

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%). This work establishes a subspace-theoretic feature disentanglement framework for collaborative cross-camera cow identification, offering a new paradigm for precise animal monitoring in uncontrolled smart farming environments."}

In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. The framework is called View-aware Low-light Video Enhancement (VLLVE). We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Building upon VLLVE, we propose a more comprehensive decomposition strategy by introducing an additive residual term, resulting in VLLVE++. This residual term can simulate scene-adaptive degradations, which are difficult to model using a decomposition formulation for common scenes, thereby further enhancing the ability to capture the overall content of videos. In addition, VLLVE++ enables bidirectional learning for both enhancement and degradation-aware correspondence refinement (end-to-end manner), effectively increasing reliable correspondences while filtering out incorrect ones. Notably, VLLVE++ demonstrates strong capability in handling challenging cases, such as real-world scenes and videos with high dynamics.

To address this challenge, we propose TextResNet, a framework that reformulates the optimization process to achieve precise signal routing via four key innovations. Firstly, in the forward pass, it enforces Additive Semantic Deltas to preserve an Identity Highway for gradient flow. Secondly, in the backward pass, it introduces Semantic Gradient Decomposition via a Semantic Projector to disentangle feedback into causally independent subspaces. Thirdly, it implements Causal Routing, which routes projected signals to their specific components. Finally, it performs Density-Aware Optimization Scheduling to leverage the disentangled signals to dynamically allocate resources to key system bottlenecks.

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation."}

To bridge this gap, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves a sublinear regret guarantee for contextual episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with personalized feedback. Technically, we extend the reward-estimator construction of Zhang et al.

Building on this estimator, we design an Inverse-Gap-Weighting (IGW) algorithm for policy optimization.

Interestingly, we find that the reverse direction of this asymmetry behaves differently: learning to self-verify can effectively improve generation performance, achieving accuracy comparable to standard generation training while yielding more efficient and effective reasoning traces. Building on this observation, we further explore integrating self-verification into generation training by formulating a multi-task reinforcement learning framework, where generation and self-verification are optimized as two independent but complementary objectives. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models demonstrate performance gains over generation-only training in both generation and verification capabilities."}

In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to \"see\". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only.

To generate reliable, high-fidelity supervision, we first train a dedicated semantically-preserved compressor on mathematical CoT data with fine-grained annotations.

To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time."}

They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts.

Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline."}

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

In ReLU-based models, the activation pattern induced by a given input determines the piecewise-linear region in which the network behaves affinely. Motivated by this geometry, we investigate whether training exhibits a two-timescale behavior: an early stage with substantial changes in activation patterns and a later stage where weight updates predominantly refine the model within largely stable activation regimes. We first prove a local stability property: outside measure-zero sets of parameters and inputs, sufficiently small parameter perturbations preserve the activation pattern of a fixed input, implying locally affine behavior within activation regions. We then empirically track per-iteration changes in weights and activation patterns across fully-connected and convolutional architectures, as well as Transformer-based models, where activation patterns are recorded in the ReLU feed-forward (MLP/FFN) submodules, using fixed validation subsets. Across the evaluated settings, activation-pattern changes decay 3 times earlier than weight-update magnitudes, showing that late-stage training often proceeds within relatively stable activation regimes. These findings provide a concrete, architecture-agnostic instrument for monitoring training dynamics and motivate further study of decoupled optimization strategies for piecewise-linear networks.

SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts. It also leverages similarity patterns to identify and preserve critical experts, thereby preventing capability loss. Notably, SERE avoids static expert pruning or merging, instead enabling dynamic expert skipping based on batch-level expert redundancy. Additionally, we provide an efficient custom CUDA kernel for SERE, enabling plug-and-play use in vLLM with only a single-line code change.

To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy.

Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios.

We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret.

Using a compact trading-strategy DSL with four semantic components (long/short entry and exit), we learn a matching block-factorized embedding and compare isotropic Gaussian mutation over the full latent space to geometry-compiled mutation that restricts updates to semantically paired entry--exit subspaces and proposes directions using a learned flow-based model trained on logged mutation outcomes.\n  Under identical $(μ+λ)$ evolution strategies and fixed evaluation budgets across five assets, the learned mutation operator discovers strong strategies using an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieves the highest median out-of-sample Sharpe ratio.

For dense-reward VEG tasks, compute should be allocated to sample diversity and intelligent selection rather than gradient adaptation. The surprisal-guided selection principle may generalize to other execution-grounded domains where optimal solutions occupy the distribution tail."}

Therefore, we introduce MVAnimate, a novel framework that synthesizes both 2D and 3D information of dynamic figures based on multi-view prior information, to enhance the generated video quality. Our approach leverages multi-view prior information to produce temporally consistent and spatially coherent animation outputs, demonstrating improvements over existing animation methods. Our MVAnimate also optimizes the multi-view videos of the target character, enhancing the video quality from different views.

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility."}

To propose a stability-preserving way to inject spectral capacity into existing MLP/FFN layers under fixed parameter and training budgets, we introduce Spectral Gating Networks (SGN), a drop-in spectral reparameterization. SGN augments a standard activation pathway with a compact spectral pathway and learnable gates that allow the model to start from a stable base behavior and progressively allocate capacity to spectral features during training. The spectral pathway is instantiated with trainable Random Fourier Features (learned frequencies and phases), replacing grid-based splines and removing resolution dependence. A hybrid GELU-Fourier formulation further improves optimization robustness while enhancing high-frequency fidelity. Across vision, NLP, audio, and PDE benchmarks, SGN consistently improves accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under comparable computational budgets, achieving 93.15% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and up to 11.7x faster inference than spline-based KAN variants.

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations."}

Recent work has improved the training stability of deep PC networks (PCNs) by leveraging some BP-inspired reparameterisations. However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs."}

However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized."}

Although recent works incorporate structural information, they implicitly condition adaptation on the smoothness priors of sourcetrained GNNs, thereby limiting their generalization to structurally distinct targets. This dependency becomes a critical bottleneck under significant topological shifts, where the source model misinterprets distinct topological patterns unseen in the source domain as noise, rendering pseudo-label-based adaptation unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Universal Structural Basis Distillation, a framework that shifts the paradigm from adapting a biased model to learning a universal structural basis for SF-GDA. Instead of adapting a biased source model to a specific target, our core idea is to construct a structure-agnostic basis that proactively covers the full spectrum of potential topological patterns. Specifically, USBD employs a bi-level optimization framework to distill the source dataset into a compact structural basis. By enforcing the prototypes to span the full Dirichlet energy spectrum, the learned basis explicitly captures diverse topological motifs, ranging from low-frequency clusters to high-frequency chains, beyond those present in the source. This ensures that the learned basis creates a comprehensive structural covering capable of handling targets with disparate structures. For inference, we introduce a spectral-aware ensemble mechanism that dynamically activates the optimal prototype combination based on the spectral fingerprint of the target graph. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that USBD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with severe structural shifts, while achieving superior computational efficiency by decoupling the adaptation cost from the target data scale."}

LK constructs a task-agnostic library of options from these eigenvectors, forming a behavior basis guaranteed to contain the optimal policy for any reward within the linear span. A meta-policy learns to stitch these options dynamically, enabling efficient learning of policies outside the original linear constraints.

Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks."}

We introduce $D^3PO$, a PPO-based framework that reorganizes multi-objective policy optimization to address these issues directly. $D^3PO$ preserves per-objective learning signals through a decomposed optimization pipeline and integrates preferences only after stabilization, enabling reliable credit assignment. In addition, a scaled diversity regularizer enforces sensitivity of policy behavior to preference changes, preventing collapse. Across standard MORL benchmarks, including high-dimensional and many-objective control tasks, $D^3PO$ consistently discovers broader and higher-quality Pareto fronts than prior single- and multi-policy methods, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art hypervolume and expected utility while using a single deployable policy."}

However, current ways of entire-block pruning suffer from risks of discarding meaningful cues learned in those blocks, leading to substantial performance degradation. As another line of model compression, channel pruning can better preserve performance, while it cannot reduce model depth and is challenged by inconsistent pruning ratios for individual layers. To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \\textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance. It outperforms existing pruning methods in both zero-shot accuracies and WikiText-2 perplexity across various model types and parameter sizes. On LLaMA-2/3 and Qwen-1.5 models, FlattenGPT retains 90-96\\% of zero-shot performance with a compression ratio of 20\\%.

A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames.

To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data.

Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions. Together, these findings provide evidence that LLMs dynamically construct and use structured, latent representations in context for inference, offering insights into the computational processes underlying flexible adaptation."}

Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions.

In this paper, we present CausalTaD, a method that injects causal knowledge into LLMs for tabular anomaly detection. We first identify the causal relationships between columns and reorder them to align with these causal relationships. This reordering can be modeled as a linear ordering problem. Since each column contributes differently to the causal relationships, we further propose a reweighting strategy to assign different weights to different columns to enhance this effect.

Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse.

Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps.

This leads to noisy supervision, poor sample efficiency, and suboptimal policy updates. We address these issues by formulating rollout scheduling in RLVR as a contextual bandit problem and proposing a unified neural scheduling framework that adaptively selects high-value rollouts throughout training. Each rollout is treated as an arm whose reward is defined by the induced performance gain between consecutive optimization steps. The resulting scheduler supports both noise-aware intra-group selection and adaptive global reuse of historical rollouts within a single principled framework.

A key challenge is that most post-hoc GNN explainers are designed for homogeneous graphs, and naive adaptations to heterogeneous neighborhoods can mix semantics and confound perturbations. To enable a controlled empirical analysis, we introduce MetaXplain, a meta-path-aware post-hoc explanation protocol that applies existing explainers in the native meta-path view domain via (i) view-factorized explanations, (ii) schema-valid channel-wise perturbations, and (iii) fusion-aware attribution, without modifying the underlying predictor.

However, existing approaches generally depend on static heuristic rules and fail to account for the interdependencies among layers, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the pruning process. To this end, this paper proposes a game-theoretic framework that formulates layer pruning as a cooperative game in which each layer acts as a player and model performance serves as the utility. As computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible for large language models (LLMs), we propose using a lightweight surrogate network to estimate layer-wise marginal contributions. This network can predict LLM performance for arbitrary layer combinations at a low computational cost. Additionally, we employ stratified Monte Carlo mask sampling to further reduce the cost of Sharpley value estimation. This approach captures inter-layer dependencies and dynamically identifies critical layers for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method in terms of perplexity and zero-shot accuracy, achieving more efficient and effective layer-wise pruning for large language models."}

Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://worldarena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI."}

We present the first comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art detection methods, comprising 23 pretrained detector variants (due to multiple released versions of certain detectors), across 12 diverse datasets, comprising 2.6~million image samples spanning 291 unique generators including modern diffusion models.

Furthermore, traditional text generation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore), originally developed for machine translation and summarization, fail to capture the unique aspects of sports feedback quality. To address the first problem, using rock climbing as our case study, we propose using auxiliary freely-available web data from the target domain, such as competition videos and coaching manuals, in addition to existing sports feedback from a disjoint, source domain to improve sports feedback generation performance on the target domain.

This leads to numerical instability and spurious correlations. In this work, we introduce the Causal Schrödinger Bridge (CSB), a framework that reformulates counterfactual inference as Entropic Optimal Transport. Unlike deterministic approaches that require strict invertibility, CSB leverages diffusion processes (SDEs) to robustly \"tunnel\" through support mismatches while strictly enforcing structural admissibility constraints. We prove the Structural Decomposition Theorem, showing that the global high-dimensional bridge factorizes into local, robust transitions. Empirical validation on high-dimensional interventions (Morpho-MNIST) demonstrates that CSB significantly outperforms deterministic baselines in structural consistency, particularly in regimes of strong, out-of-distribution treatments."}

Controlling how LLMs internally represent concepts typically requires sophisticated methods to first identify, then intervene on the model's existing feature geometry. We bypass all of this.\n  We finetune an LLM with a simple auxiliary loss, training 16 of its 3072 residual stream dimensions to be inert interpretability flags that simply indicate what concepts are required for generation. The model reorganizes around them anyway, learning to rely on these flags during actual generation tasks. As a result, these inert flags become genuine internal features: interpretable control switches that allow us to steer generation at inference time. Why does this work? When a feature is reliably supplied at a fixed location, gradient descent gradually eliminates redundant encodings elsewhere, and the model erodes its own alternative representations. A model's efficiency pressure is a lever - exploitable to induce interpretable, controllable representations."}

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of ArcFlow both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods.

To this end, we propose Raster2Seq, framing floorplan reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence task in which floorplan elements--such as rooms, windows, and doors--are represented as labeled polygon sequences that jointly encode geometry and semantics. Our approach introduces an autoregressive decoder that learns to predict the next corner conditioned on image features and previously generated corners using guidance from learnable anchors. These anchors represent spatial coordinates in image space, hence allowing for effectively directing the attention mechanism to focus on informative image regions. By embracing the autoregressive mechanism, our method offers flexibility in the output format, enabling for efficiently handling complex floorplans with numerous rooms and diverse polygon structures.

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

Model merging offers a compelling alternative by directly integrating the weights of multiple source models without requiring additional data or extensive training. However, conventional model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging, often suffer from the unintended combination of non-generalizable features, especially when source models exhibit significant weight disparities. Comparatively, model ensembling generally provides more stable and superior performance that aggregates multiple models by averaging outputs. However, it incurs higher inference costs and increased storage requirements. While previous studies experimentally showed the similarities between model merging and ensembling, theoretical evidence and evaluation metrics remain lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the compatibility of merging source models using very limited unlabeled data. By measuring the discrepancy between parameter averaging and model ensembling at layer and node levels, M-Loss facilitates more effective merging strategies. Specifically, M-Loss serves both as a quantitative criterion of the theoretical feasibility of model merging, and a guide for parameter significance in model pruning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating M-Loss into the merging process significantly improves the alignment between merged models and model ensembling, providing a scalable and efficient framework for accurate model consolidation."}

We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods.

We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits.

Specifically, an Arithmetic Method Algorithm (AMA) is adopted to assess the efficiency of the introduced arithmetic method, while an Arithmetic Method Regression (AMR) algorithm is proposed as an optimization of k-NN adopting the potentiality of AMA. Such algorithm is compared with other regression algorithms, according to an introduced optimal inference decision rule, and evaluated on certain real world data sources, which are publicly available. Results are promising since the proposed AMR algorithm has comparable performance with the other algorithms, while in most cases it achieves better performance than the k-NN.

Existing approaches either depend on parametric policies with limited expressivity or employ diffusion-based policies whose intractable likelihoods hinder reliable entropy estimation in soft policy objectives. We address this challenge by directly realizing soft-policy sampling via Langevin dynamics driven by the action gradient of the Q-function. This perspective leads to Langevin Q-Learning (LQL), which samples actions from the target Boltzmann distribution without explicitly parameterizing the policy. However, directly applying Langevin dynamics suffers from slow mixing in high-dimensional and non-convex Q-landscapes, limiting its practical effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose Noise-Conditioned Langevin Q-Learning (NC-LQL), which integrates multi-scale noise perturbations into the value function. NC-LQL learns a noise-conditioned Q-function that induces a sequence of progressively smoothed value landscapes, enabling sampling to transition from global exploration to precise mode refinement.

Departing from particle-centric SDE analyses, we employ an SPDE framework to model the evolution of the probability density field under stochastic drift perturbations. Under a simplified setting, we utilize this framework to interpret the robustness of generative models through the lens of geometric stability and displacement convexity. Furthermore, we introduce a candidate evaluation metric derived from the quadratic variation of the SPDE solution projected onto a radial test function. Preliminary observations suggest that this metric remains effective using only the initial 10% of the sampling trajectory, indicating a potential for computational efficiency."}

We propose GRAFT (Gated Residual Accelerated Failure Time), a novel AFT model that decouples prognostic ranking from calibration. GRAFT's hybrid architecture combines a linear AFT model with a non-linear residual neural network, and it also integrates stochastic gates for automatic, end-to-end feature selection. The model is trained by directly optimizing a differentiable, C-index-aligned ranking loss using stochastic conditional imputation from local Kaplan-Meier estimators. In public benchmarks, GRAFT outperforms baselines in discrimination and calibration, while remaining robust and sparse in high-noise settings."}

This thesis presents EMSYNC (EMotion and SYNChronization), a fast, free, and automatic solution that generates music tailored to the input video, enabling content creators to enhance their productions without composing or licensing music. Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called \"boundary offset encodings,\" aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator. User studies show that it consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of music richness, emotional alignment, temporal synchronization, and overall preference, setting a new state-of-the-art in video-based music generation."}

In practice, deployment requirements often vary across scenarios, necessitating a single policy that can adapt zero-shot to different cost thresholds. However, most existing offline safe RL methods are trained under a pre-specified threshold, yielding policies with limited generalization and deployment flexibility across cost thresholds. Motivated by recent progress in conditional sequence modeling (CSM), which enables flexible goal-conditioned control by specifying target returns, we propose RCDT, a CSM-based method that supports zero-shot deployment across multiple cost thresholds within a single trained policy. RCDT is the first CSM-based offline safe RL algorithm that integrates a Lagrangian-style cost penalty with an auto-adaptive penalty coefficient. To avoid overly conservative behavior and achieve a more favorable return--cost trade-off, a reward--cost-aware trajectory reweighting mechanism and Q-value regularization are further incorporated. Extensive experiments on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that RCDT consistently improves return--cost trade-offs over representative baselines, advancing the state-of-the-art in offline safe RL."}

While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To our knowledge, SAGE pioneers the adaptation of geometric foundation models via Internet video, establishing a scalable paradigm for general-purpose 3D learning."}

Current KV cache eviction methods typically rely on instantaneous heuristic metrics, implicitly assuming that score magnitudes are consistent proxies for importance across all heads. However, this overlooks the heterogeneity in predictive fidelity across attention heads. While certain heads prioritize the instantaneous contribution of tokens, others are dedicated to capturing long-horizon utility. In this paper, we propose that optimal budget allocation should be governed by the marginal utility in preserving long-term semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose LU-KV, a novel framework that optimizes head-level budget allocation through a convex-hull relaxation and a marginal-utility-based greedy solver to achieve near-optimal precision. Furthermore, we implement a data-driven offline profiling protocol to facilitate the practical deployment of LU-KV. Extensive evaluations on LongBench and RULER benchmarks demonstrate that LU-KV achieves an 80% reduction in KV cache size with minimal performance degradation, while simultaneously reducing inference latency and GPU memory footprint."}

To address this, we introduce LMABO, a novel framework that casts a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) as a zero-shot, online strategist for the BO process. At each iteration, LMABO uses a structured state representation to prompt the LLM to select the most suitable acquisition function from a diverse portfolio. In an evaluation across 50 benchmark problems, LMABO demonstrates a significant performance improvement over strong static, adaptive portfolio, and other LLM-based baselines. We show that the LLM's behavior is a comprehensive strategy that adapts to real-time progress, proving its advantage stems from its ability to process and synthesize the complete optimization state into an effective, adaptive policy."}

At present, principled algorithms for this problem are lacking - some cannot guarantee that a target fairness level is achieved, while others do not feature optimality guarantees. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we put forth a unified in-processing convex optimization framework, termed FairRARI, for tackling different group-fairness criteria in a ``plug and play'' fashion. Leveraging a variational formulation of PR, the framework computes fair PR vectors by solving a strongly convex optimization problem with fairness constraints, thereby ensuring that a target fairness level is achieved. We further introduce three different fairness criteria which can be efficiently tackled using FairRARI to compute fair PR vectors with the same asymptotic time-complexity as the original PR algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets showcase that FairRARI outperforms existing methods in terms of utility, while achieving the desired fairness levels across multiple vertex groups; thereby highlighting its effectiveness."}

In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization. We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA.

However, existing approaches typically enforce a unified prompt structure and length across clients, which is inadequate under practical client heterogeneity in both data distributions and system resources, and may further introduce conflicts between globally shared and locally optimal knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SDFed}, a heterogeneous federated prompt learning framework that bridges Local-Global Discrepancy via Subspace Refinement and Divergence Control. SDFed maintains a fixed-length global prompt for efficient aggregation while allowing each client to learn a variable-length local prompt to better match its data characteristics and capacity. To mitigate local-global conflicts and facilitate effective knowledge transfer, SDFed introduces a subspace refinement method for local prompts and an information retention and divergence control strategy that preserves key local information while maintaining appropriate separability between global and local representations. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SDFed consistently improves performance and robustness in heterogeneous federated settings."}

To demonstrate the practical utility of CausalCompass, we conduct extensive benchmarking of representative TSCD algorithms across eight assumption-violation scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that no single method consistently attains optimal performance across all settings. Nevertheless, the methods exhibiting superior overall performance across diverse scenarios are almost invariably deep learning-based approaches. We further provide hyperparameter sensitivity analyses to deepen the understanding of these findings. We also find, somewhat surprisingly, that NTS-NOTEARS relies heavily on standardized preprocessing in practice, performing poorly in the vanilla setting but exhibiting strong performance after standardization.

However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning.

UReason contains 2,000 instances across five task families: Code, Arithmetic, Spatial, Attribute, and Text reasoning. To isolate the role of reasoning traces, we introduce an evaluation framework comparing direct generation, reasoning-guided generation, and de-contextualized generation which conditions only on the refined prompt. Across eight open-source unified models, we observe a consistent Reasoning Paradox: Reasoning traces generally improve performance over direct generation, yet retaining intermediate thoughts as conditioning context often hinders visual synthesis, and conditioning only on the refined prompt yields substantial gains. Our analysis suggests that the bottleneck lies in contextual interference rather than insufficient reasoning capacity. UReason provides a principled testbed for studying reasoning in unified models and motivates future methods that effectively integrate reasoning for visual generation while mitigating interference."}

ERIS combines a model partitioning strategy, distributing aggregation across multiple client-side aggregators, with a distributed shifted gradient compression mechanism. We theoretically prove that ERIS (i) converges at the same rate as FedAvg under standard assumptions, and (ii) bounds mutual information leakage inversely with the number of aggregators, enabling strong privacy guarantees with no accuracy degradation. Experiments across image and text tasks, including large language models, confirm that ERIS achieves FedAvg-level accuracy while substantially reducing communication cost and improving robustness to membership inference and reconstruction attacks, without relying on heavy cryptography or noise injection."}

A Comparative Study on the Cross-Lingual Transfer of Composite Harms", "comment": "Accepted at the AICS Workshop, AAAI 2026", "summary": "Most safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) remain anchored in English. Translation is often used as a shortcut to probe multilingual behavior, but it rarely captures the full picture, especially when harmful intent or structure morphs across languages. Some types of harm survive translation almost intact, while others distort or disappear. To study this effect, we introduce CompositeHarm, a translation-based benchmark designed to examine how safety alignment holds up as both syntax and semantics shift. It combines two complementary English datasets, AttaQ, which targets structured adversarial attacks, and MMSafetyBench, which covers contextual, real-world harms, and extends them into six languages: English, Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati. Using three large models, we find that attack success rates rise sharply in Indic languages, especially under adversarial syntax, while contextual harms transfer more moderately. To ensure scalability and energy efficiency, our study adopts lightweight inference strategies inspired by edge-AI design principles, reducing redundant evaluation passes while preserving cross-lingual fidelity. This design makes large-scale multilingual safety testing both computationally feasible and environmentally conscious. Overall, our results show that translated benchmarks are a necessary first step, but not a sufficient one, toward building grounded, resource-aware, language-adaptive safety systems."}

A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Ablations confirm that each component contributes to more interpretable and human-aligned visual reasoning."}

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively.

Consequently, this multi-task scenario requires addressing critical questions: which tasks are similar, and how and why do they exhibit similarity? In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fréchet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting.

Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\\mathbf{5.1\\times}$ speedup."}

CauScale improves time efficiency via a reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps. To keep high causal discovery accuracy, CauScale adopts a two-stream design: a data stream extracts relational evidence from high-dimensional observations, while a graph stream integrates statistical graph priors and preserves key structural signals. CauScale successfully scales to 500-node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations.

To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics. Experimental results on CIE-Bench demonstrate that MCIE-E1 consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving a 23.96% improvement in instruction compliance."}

A key challenge in unsupervised TSAD is that many anomalies are too subtle to exhibit detectable deviation in any single view (e.g., time domain), and instead manifest as inconsistencies across multiple views like time, frequency, and a mixture of resolutions. However, most cross-view methods rely on feature or score fusion and do not enforce analysis-synthesis consistency, meaning the frequency branch is not required to reconstruct the time signal through an inverse transform, and vice versa. In this paper, we present Learnable Fusion of Tri-view Tokens (LEFT), a unified unsupervised TSAD framework that models anomalies as inconsistencies across complementary representations. LEFT learns feature tokens from three views of the same input time series: frequency-domain tokens that embed periodicity information, time-domain tokens that capture local dynamics, and multi-scale tokens that learns abnormal patterns at varying time series granularities. By learning a set of adaptive Nyquist-constrained spectral filters, the original time series is rescaled into multiple resolutions and then encoded, allowing these multi-scale tokens to complement the extracted frequency- and time-domain information. When generating the fused representation, we introduce a novel objective that reconstructs fine-grained targets from coarser multi-scale structure, and put forward an innovative time-frequency cycle consistency constraint to explicitly regularize cross-view agreement. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that LEFT yields the best detection accuracy against SOTA baselines, while achieving a 5x reduction on FLOPs and 8x speed-up for training."}

We formulate budgeted ensemble selection as maximizing the mutual information between the true label and predictions of the selected models. Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget.

In this work, we make test-time optimization both efficient and reliable by replacing soft regularization with hard white Gaussian noise constraints enforced via projected gradient ascent. Our method applies a closed-form projection after each update to keep the latent vector explicitly noise-like throughout optimization, preventing the drift that leads to unrealistic artifacts. This enforcement adds minimal cost: the projection matches the $O(N \\log N)$ complexity of standard algorithms such as sorting or FFT and does not practically increase wall-clock time. In experiments, our approach reaches a comparable Aesthetic Score using only 30% of the wall-clock time required by the SOTA regularization-based method, while preventing reward hacking."}

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps.

In the first stage, we introduce a synthesis-then-hybrid strategy, which involves a synthesis operation to generate pure synthetic data, followed by a hybrid operation that fuses the synthetic data with the original data. In the second stage, we present a kernel ridge regression (KRR)-based synthesis strategy, where a KRR model is first trained on the original data and then used to generate synthetic outputs based on the synthetic inputs produced in the first stage. By leveraging the theoretical strengths of KRR and the covariant distribution retention achieved in the first stage, our proposed two-stage synthesis strategy enables a statistics-driven restricted privacy--prediction trade-off and guarantee optimal prediction performance.

We additionally extend low-rank communication to embedding gradients with embedding-specific ranks and refresh schedules, yielding additional communication and memory savings over keeping embeddings dense. Across pretraining from 60M to 1B model scales, TSR-Adam reduces average communicated bytes per step by $13\\times$, and on GLUE fine-tuning it reduces communication by $25\\times$, while achieving comparable performance; we further provide a theoretical stationarity analysis for the proposed update.

To address this limitation, we introduce a new fairness definition for generative models, termed as equalized generative treatment (EGT), which requires comparable generation quality across all sensitive groups, with quality measured via a reference f-divergence. We further analyze the trade-offs induced by EGT, demonstrating that enforcing fairness constraints necessarily couples the overall model quality to that of the most challenging group to approximate. This indicates that a simple yet efficient min-max fine-tuning method should be able to balance f-divergences across sensitive groups to satisfy EGT.

In this paper, Firstly, we examine the foundational principles of MoE, with an in-depth exploration of its core components-the routing network and expert network. Subsequently, we extend beyond the centralized paradigm to the decentralized paradigm, which unlocks the immense untapped potential of decentralized infrastructure, enables democratization of MoE development for broader communities, and delivers greater scalability and cost-efficiency. Furthermore we focus on exploring its vertical domain applications. Finally, we also identify key challenges and promising future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is currently the most comprehensive review in the field of MoE. We aim for this article to serve as a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling them to navigate and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements."}

Today, we unveil LLaDA2.1, a paradigm shift designed to transcend this trade-off. By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade. Furthering this evolution, underpinned by an expansive context window, we implement the first large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework specifically tailored for dLLMs, anchored by specialized techniques for stable gradient estimation. This alignment not only sharpens reasoning precision but also elevates instruction-following fidelity, bridging the chasm between diffusion dynamics and complex human intent. We culminate this work by releasing LLaDA2.1-Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1-Flash (100B). Across 33 rigorous benchmarks, LLaDA2.1 delivers strong task performance and lightning-fast decoding speed.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

In this paper, we first reveal that even the state-of-the-art plug-and-play defense can be bypassed by adaptive attacks, exposing a critical limitation of existing runtime defenses. We then propose Dashed Line Defense (DLD), a plug-and-play post-processing method specifically designed to withstand adaptive query strategies. By introducing ambiguity in how the observed loss reflects the true adversarial strength of candidate examples, DLD prevents attackers from reliably analyzing and adapting their queries, effectively disrupting the AE generation process. We provide theoretical guarantees of DLD's defense capability and validate its effectiveness through experiments on ImageNet, demonstrating that DLD consistently outperforms prior defenses--even under worst-case adaptive attacks--while preserving the model's predicted labels."}

FIRE quantifies stability through Squared Frobenius Error (SFE), measuring proximity to past weights, and plasticity through Deviation from Isometry (DfI), reflecting weight isotropy. The reinitialization point is obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem, minimizing SFE subject to DfI being zero, which is efficiently approximated by Newton-Schulz iteration. FIRE is evaluated on continual visual learning (CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18), language modeling (OpenWebText with GPT-0.1B), and reinforcement learning (HumanoidBench with SAC and Atari games with DQN).

To address these challenges, we propose CompilerKV, a risk-adaptive and head-aware compression framework that compiles offline experience into reusable decision tables for prefill-only deployment. CompilerKV integrates two key synergistic components: (i) a Head Heterogeneity Table, learned via offline contextual bandits, which assigns head-specific reliability weights to govern functional differences across attention heads explicitly; and (ii) a Risk-Adaptive Threshold Gating mechanism that jointly models attention entropy and local perplexity, transforming prompt-level risk into deployable retention thresholds.

To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known. Experiments in 6-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em and competitive Pokemon show consistent improvements in long-term return over strong LLM and RL baselines, and graceful degradation under controlled prediction noise."}

In this work, we introduce an inverse reinforcement learning framework for learning sampling strategies without retraining the denoiser. We formulate the diffusion sampling procedure as a discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process, where actions correspond to optional modifications of the sampling dynamics. To optimize action scheduling, we avoid defining an explicit reward function. Instead, we directly match the target behavior expected from the sampler using policy gradient techniques. We provide experimental evidence that this approach can improve the quality of samples generated by pretrained diffusion models and automatically tune sampling hyperparameters."}

We present V-ABFT, a variance-based adaptive threshold algorithm that achieves tighter error bounds by directly modeling the verification difference. By leveraging statistical variance estimation, V-ABFT reduces the threshold-to-actual-error ratio to approximately $7$--$20\\times$ for FP32/FP64 and $48$--$158\\times$ for BF16, representing a \\textbf{6--48$\\times$ improvement} over A-ABFT while maintaining zero false positive rate across BF16, FP16, FP32, and FP64 precisions.

Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real model weights (LLaMA-7B, GPT-2, ViT) demonstrate V-ABFT's effectiveness across diverse distributions. V-ABFT is platform-agnostic and has been integrated into fault-tolerant GEMM implementations on both NPUs and GPUs."}

In this paper, we identify and systematize 11 methodological pitfalls that frequently occur in DRL for cybersecurity (DRL4Sec) literature across the stages of environment modeling, agent training, performance evaluation, and system deployment. By analyzing 66 significant DRL4Sec papers (2018-2025), we quantify the prevalence of each pitfall and find an average of over five pitfalls per paper.

To address this, we propose Epigraph-Guided Flow Matching (EpiFlow), a framework that formulates safe offline RL as a state-constrained optimal control problem to co-optimize safety and performance. We learn a feasibility value function derived from an epigraph reformulation of the optimal control problem, thereby avoiding the decoupled objectives or post-hoc filtering common in prior work. Policies are synthesized by reweighting the behavior distribution based on this epigraph value function and fitting a generative policy via flow matching, enabling efficient, distribution-consistent sampling. Across various safety-critical tasks, including Safety-Gymnasium benchmarks, EpiFlow achieves competitive returns with near-zero empirical safety violations, demonstrating the effectiveness of epigraph-guided policy synthesis."}

To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition."}

Here, we study noise-robust learning: are transformers trained on data with noisy features able to find a target function that correctly predicts labels for noiseless features? We show that transformers succeed at noise-robust learning for a selection of $k$-sparse parity and majority functions, compared to LSTMs which fail at this task for even modest feature noise. However, we find that transformers typically fail at noise-robust learning of random $k$-juntas, especially when the boolean sensitivity of the optimal solution is smaller than that of the target function. We argue that this failure is due to a combination of two factors: transformers' bias toward simpler functions, combined with an observation that the optimal function for noise-robust learning typically has lower sensitivity than the target function for random boolean functions. We test this hypothesis by exploiting transformers' simplicity bias to trap them in an incorrect solution, but show that transformers can escape this trap by training with an additional loss term penalizing high-sensitivity solutions. Overall, we find that transformers are particularly ineffective for learning boolean functions in the presence of feature noise."}

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition."}

By prioritizing these low cosine similarity queries, the behavior of full attention during the prefill stage can be closely approximated. QUOKA leverages this observation, accelerating attention by (1) first retaining a small set of representative queries and (2) then subselectin the keys most aligned with those queries.

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry."}

Experiments demonstrate that augmenting several existing reconstruction methods with sample splitting consistently improves reconstruction performance."}

Prior attempts to combine their strengths typically lead to a stability-performance trade-off. We attribute this phenomenon to a structural incompatibility within a single-stream design: Any application of the Post-Norm operation inevitably obstructs the clean identity gradient preserved by Pre-Norm. To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity. Extensive pre-training experiments on 1.3B-parameter models demonstrate that SiameseNorm exhibits exceptional optimization robustness and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

In Alzheimers disease (AD), multimodal neuroimaging offers complementary signals but VAE-based normative models often (i) fit the healthy reference distribution imperfectly, inflating false positives, and (ii) use posterior aggregation (e.g., PoE/MoE) that can yield weak multimodal fusion in the shared latent space. We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts.

As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances. To quantify expressivity needs in practice, we conduct experiments on random instances from the G4SAT benchmark and industrial instances from the International SAT Competition. Our results suggest that while random instances are largely distinguishable, industrial instances often require more expressivity to predict a satisfying assignment."}

In practice, domain knowledge evolves continuously through new regulations, products, services, and interaction patterns. Retraining or fine-tuning LLMs for every new instance is computationally infeasible. Additionally, real-world environments also exhibit temporal dynamics with shifting data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining. In response, we introduce Online Domain-aware Decoding framework (ODD). ODD performs probability-level fusion between a base LLM and a prefix-tree prior, guided by adaptive confidence modulation using disagreement and continuity signals. Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics. It yields an absolute ROUGE-L gain of 0.065 and a 13.6% relative improvement in Cosine Similarity over the best baseline. These results demonstrate ODD 's robustness to evolving lexical and contextual patterns, making it suitable for dynamic LLM applications."}

Existing approaches often struggle with flexible view configurations, including arbitrary view combinations, numbers of views, and heterogeneous modalities. Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose RALIS, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views. To address residual discrepancies not captured by contrastive learning, we employ a mixture-of-experts module with a specialized load balancing strategy, tasked with adapting to arbitrary view combinations. We highlight the geometric relationship among components in our model and how they combine well in the latent space. RALIS is validated on four datasets encompassing inertial and human pose modalities, with the number of views ranging from three to nine, demonstrating its performance and flexibility."}

We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information.

However, training GNNs without protection may leak sensitive personal information in graph data, including links and node features. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an advanced technique for protecting data privacy in decentralized networks. Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph. Concretely, HoGS first collects the link and feature information of the graph under LDP, and then utilizes the phenomenon of homophily in graph data to reconstruct the graph structure and node features separately, thereby effectively mitigating the negative impact of LDP on the downstream GNN training. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of HoGS and conduct experiments using the generated synthetic graph as input to various state-of-the-art GNN architectures. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that HoGS significantly outperforms baseline methods in the accuracy of training GNNs."}

Deliberation follows a consistent trajectory: an exploration phase where probability mass spreads across candidates, tentative commitment to a frontrunner, and either convergence or backtracking. Backtracking is prevalent (32% of instances), beneficial (34% accuracy gain over non-backtracking instances), and predominantly directed away from the semantically closest distractor toward the correct answer. The search is adaptive: replacing distractors with implausible alternatives shortens exploration by 54%.

While most BO pipelines begin with uniform random initialization, default hyperparameter values shipped with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn encode implicit expert knowledge and could serve as informative starting points that accelerate convergence. This hypothesis, despite its intuitive appeal, has remained largely unexamined. We formalize the idea by initializing BO with points drawn from truncated Gaussian distributions centered at library defaults and compare the resulting trajectories against a uniform-random baseline. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation spanning three BO back-ends (BoTorch, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize), three model families (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons), and five benchmark datasets covering classification and regression tasks. Performance is assessed through convergence speed and final predictive quality, and statistical significance is determined via one-sided binomial tests. Across all conditions, default-informed initialization yields no statistically significant advantage over purely random sampling, with p-values ranging from 0.141 to 0.908. A sensitivity analysis on the prior variance confirms that, while tighter concentration around the defaults improves early evaluations, this transient benefit vanishes as optimization progresses, leaving final performance unchanged. Our results provide no evidence that default hyperparameters encode useful directional information for optimization. We therefore recommend that practitioners treat hyperparameter tuning as an integral part of model development and favor principled, data-driven search strategies over heuristic reliance on library defaults."}

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment."}

Centroid distance in the low-dimensional subspace matches trained probe performance (0.90 AUC), enabling few-shot detection: on GPT-2, 25 labeled examples achieve 89% of full-data accuracy. We validate causally through activation steering: the learned direction produces 10.9 percentage point changes in error rates while random directions show no effect. Internal probes achieve 0.80-0.97 AUC; output-based methods (P(True), semantic entropy) achieve only 0.44-0.64 AUC. The correctness signal exists internally but is not expressed in outputs.

To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail.

Yet even small downstream updates can compromise earlier learned behaviors (e.g., safety), exposing a brittleness known as catastrophic forgetting. This suggests standard RLHF objectives do not guarantee robustness to future adaptation. To address it, most prior work designs downstream-time methods to preserve previously learned behaviors. We argue that preventing this requires pre-finetuning robustness: the base policy should avoid brittle high-reward solutions whose reward drops sharply under standard fine-tuning.\n  We propose Fine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO), a robust RLHF framework that optimizes reward not only at the current policy, but across a KL-bounded neighborhood of policies reachable by downstream adaptation. The key idea is to ensure reward stability under policy shifts via a max-min formulation. By modifying GRPO, we develop an algorithm with no extra computation, and empirically show it substantially reduces safety degradation across multiple base models and downstream fine-tuning regimes (SFT and RL) while preserving downstream task performance. We further study a math-focused RL setting, demonstrating that FRPO preserves accuracy under subsequent fine-tuning."}

In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy.

To address this, we propose CoRect (Context-Aware Logit Contrast for Hidden State Rectification). By contrasting logits from contextualized and non-contextualized forward passes, CoRect identifies layers that exhibit high parametric bias without requiring ground-truth labels. It then rectifies the hidden states to preserve evidence-grounded information.

Here, we introduce FlexMoRE, a Flexible Mixture of Rank-heterogenous Experts, which may be either full-sized experts or adapters of a suitable rank. We systematically investigate the trade-off between expert rank and downstream task performance by evaluating $6$ experts with ranks $2^0$ to $2^{14}$ resulting in experiments covering 150 mixtures (96 with 2 experts, 54 with 7 experts) that are evaluated across $120$ tasks. For our experiments, we build on FlexOlmo and turn its pre-trained experts into low-rank versions. Our regression analysis from expert rank to downstream task performance reveals that the best-performing rank is substantially higher for reasoning-heavy benchmarks than for knowledge-heavy benchmarks. These findings on rank sensitivity come with direct implications for memory efficiency: Using optimal ranks, FlexMoRE yields improved downstream task performance (average score $47.18$) compared to the baseline FlexOlmo-style mixture of full-sized experts (average score $45.46$) at less than one third the parameters ($10.75$B for FlexMoRE vs. $33.27$B for FlexOlmo).

As RL is increasingly applied to settings such as verifiable rewards and multi-objective alignment, RMs are expected to encode more complex and multifaceted preference distributions. However, classifier RMs remain static once trained, limiting their adaptability at test time. We propose Variational In-Context Reward Modeling (ICRM), a novel Bayesian reward modeling objective that enables test-time steerability via in-context preference demonstrations. ICRM casts reward modeling as amortized variational inference over a latent preference probability under the Bradley-Terry model using a conjugate Beta prior. We show that ICRM adapt to unseen preference distributions at test time for both single and multi-objective settings. With more in-context demonstrations, ICRM gains 34% accuracy on SafeRLHF and 9% accuracy on RM-Bench in the single-objective setting, while widening the Pareto frontier with a 4% gain in hypervolume on helpfulness and refusal benchmarks. We further study the practical applicability of ICRM for RL training, showing that it can effectively encode verifiable rewards by outperforming a conventional RM in math reasoning. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees that the variational objective admits a global interior optimum with finite confidence, and we analyze how KL regularization mitigates reward over-optimization."}

To fill this gap, we introduce the first conceptual and methodological framework for unintended CUA behaviors, by defining their key characteristics, automatically eliciting them, and analyzing how they arise from benign inputs. We propose AutoElicit: an agentic framework that iteratively perturbs benign instructions using CUA execution feedback, and elicits severe harms while keeping perturbations realistic and benign. Using AutoElicit, we surface hundreds of harmful unintended behaviors from state-of-the-art CUAs such as Claude 4.5 Haiku and Opus. We further evaluate the transferability of human-verified successful perturbations, identifying persistent susceptibility to unintended behaviors across various other frontier CUAs.

Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends.

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens.

In this work, we focus on a prevalent yet under-explored phenomenon in graph generalization, Minimal Shift Flip (MSF),where test samples that slightly deviate from the training distribution are abruptly misclassified. To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that E2A consistently improves graph OOD generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."}

Yet, the mechanisms underlying their training performance and generalization remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide several insights into such fine-tuning through the lens of linearization. Fine-tuned models are often implicitly encouraged to remain close to the pretrained model. By making this explicit, using an Euclidean distance inductive bias in parameter space, we show that fine-tuning dynamics become equivalent to learning with the positive-definite neural tangent kernel (NTK). We specifically analyze how close the fully linear and the linearized fine-tuning optimizations are, based on the strength of the regularization. This allows us to be pragmatic about how good a model linearization is when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When linearization is a good model, our findings reveal a strong correlation between the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK and the performance of model adaptation. Motivated by this, we give spectral perturbation bounds on the NTK induced by the choice of layers selected for fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theory on Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on LLMs. These insights not only characterize fine-tuning but also have the potential to enhance PEFT techniques, paving the way to better informed and more nimble adaptation in LLMs."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a new learning paradigm, In-Context Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (ICPRL), in which both pretraining and deployment rely solely on preference feedback, eliminating the need for reward supervision. We study two variants that differ in the granularity of feedback: Immediate Preference-based RL (I-PRL) with per-step preferences, and Trajectory Preference-based RL (T-PRL) with trajectory-level comparisons. We first show that supervised pretraining, a standard approach in ICRL, remains effective under preference-only context datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of in-context reinforcement learning using only preference signals. To further improve data efficiency, we introduce alternative preference-native frameworks for I-PRL and T-PRL that directly optimize TM policies from preference data without requiring reward signals nor optimal action labels.Experiments on dueling bandits, navigation, and continuous control tasks demonstrate that ICPRL enables strong in-context generalization to unseen tasks, achieving performance comparable to ICRL methods trained with full reward supervision."}

We prove several theoretical properties of magnitude distance, including its limiting behavior across scales and conditions under which it satisfies key metric properties. In contrast to classical distances, we show that magnitude distance remains discriminative in high-dimensional settings when the scale is appropriately tuned. We further demonstrate how magnitude distance can be used as a training objective for push-forward generative models. Our experimental results support our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that magnitude distance provides meaningful signals, comparable to established distance-based generative approaches."}

Analysing the Learning Efficiency of Agentic Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for training or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), enabling adaptive, task-specific optimizations through interactive feedback. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments. These theoretical insights clarify empirical inconsistencies and provide practical criteria for deploying MARL strategies effectively in complex LLM scenarios."}

At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv.

In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics.

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts."}

Noise stability expresses a model's robustness to correlated noise applied to all input coordinates simultaneously. We provide a theoretical analysis of noise stability for single-layer attention and ReLU MLP layers and tackle the multi-layer propagation problem with a covariance interval propagation approach. Building on this theory, we develop a practical noise stability regularization method. Experiments on algorithmic and next-token-prediction tasks show that our regularizer consistently catalyzes grokking and accelerates training by approximately $35\\%$ and $75\\%$ respectively.

We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term."}

Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline."}

In ReLU-based models, the activation pattern induced by a given input determines the piecewise-linear region in which the network behaves affinely. Motivated by this geometry, we investigate whether training exhibits a two-timescale behavior: an early stage with substantial changes in activation patterns and a later stage where weight updates predominantly refine the model within largely stable activation regimes. We first prove a local stability property: outside measure-zero sets of parameters and inputs, sufficiently small parameter perturbations preserve the activation pattern of a fixed input, implying locally affine behavior within activation regions. We then empirically track per-iteration changes in weights and activation patterns across fully-connected and convolutional architectures, as well as Transformer-based models, where activation patterns are recorded in the ReLU feed-forward (MLP/FFN) submodules, using fixed validation subsets. Across the evaluated settings, activation-pattern changes decay 3 times earlier than weight-update magnitudes, showing that late-stage training often proceeds within relatively stable activation regimes. These findings provide a concrete, architecture-agnostic instrument for monitoring training dynamics and motivate further study of decoupled optimization strategies for piecewise-linear networks. For reproducibility, code and experiment configurations will be released upon acceptance."}

We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate.

We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals.

As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives."}

We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret.

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility."}

In this work, we first formalize this misalignment and prove that rotary position embedding (RoPE) is mathematically incapable of representing non-affine temporal warping. To address this, we propose Symplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE), a learnable encoding framework derived from Hamiltonian mechanics. SyPE strictly generalizes RoPE by extending the rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ to the symplectic group $\\mathrm{Sp}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, modulated by a novel input-dependent adaptive warp module. By allowing the attention mechanism to adaptively dilate or contract temporal coordinates end-to-end, our approach captures locally varying periodicities without requiring pre-defined warping functions.

The framework segments long inputs into chunks and encodes each chunk into compressed memory representations using a learned compressor. A gating module dynamically selects relevant memory blocks, which are then iteratively processed by a reasoning module with an evolving working memory to solve downstream tasks. The compressor and reasoner are jointly optimized via end-to-end reinforcement learning, while the gating module is trained separately as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks such as RULER-HQA, extrapolates context length from 7K to 1.75M tokens, and offers a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to strong long-context baselines. In particular, it achieves up to a 2 times reduction in peak GPU memory usage and a 6 times inference speedup over MemAgent."}

To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score. We also show our approach aids convolutional networks on challenging tasks, as in situations with suboptimal encoders or limited data."}

We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\\mathbf{5.1\\times}$ speedup."}

This design fundamentally disentangles the core routing problems: expert selection, modeled by a Bernoulli component, and expert contribution among chosen experts, handled by a Dirichlet component.

This leads to noisy supervision, poor sample efficiency, and suboptimal policy updates. We address these issues by formulating rollout scheduling in RLVR as a contextual bandit problem and proposing a unified neural scheduling framework that adaptively selects high-value rollouts throughout training. Each rollout is treated as an arm whose reward is defined by the induced performance gain between consecutive optimization steps. The resulting scheduler supports both noise-aware intra-group selection and adaptive global reuse of historical rollouts within a single principled framework. We provide theoretical justification by deriving sublinear regret bounds and showing that enlarging the rollout buffer improves the achievable performance upper bound.

Various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such agents. However, existing benchmarks often construct queries backward from answers, producing unnatural tasks misaligned with real-world needs. Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes a live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization. Notably, GISA provides complete human search trajectories for every query, offering gold-standard references for process-level supervision and imitation learning. Experiments on mainstream LLMs and commercial search products reveal that even the best-performing model achieves only 19.30\\% exact match score, with performance notably degrading on tasks requiring complex planning and comprehensive information gathering. These findings highlight substantial room for future improvement."}

In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking."}

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning. Finally, we discuss detection challenges and outline directions for stress-testing and evaluation, with the goal of anticipating and controlling future developments.

We investigate a fundamental question, does visual rendering truly decouple a model from tokenization constraints? Focusing on four Indonesian low-resource local languages that have their own non-Latin scripts (i.e., Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, and Lampungnese), we evaluate the impact of script-tokenizer alignment within the DualGPT architecture. Our results show that, despite visual rendering, reintegrating a text tokenizer into the architecture reintroduces the same issue that pixel-based language modeling aims to resolve, which is the tokenizer misalignment problem. Despite having lower OOV and fertility rates, we show that the Llama 2 tokenizer performs significantly worse than a custom tokenizer, with improvements of up to 30.15 chrF++. Our findings serve as a warning for future multimodal variants, as text tokenizers remain a significant barrier to equitable models."}

Current KV cache eviction methods typically rely on instantaneous heuristic metrics, implicitly assuming that score magnitudes are consistent proxies for importance across all heads. However, this overlooks the heterogeneity in predictive fidelity across attention heads. While certain heads prioritize the instantaneous contribution of tokens, others are dedicated to capturing long-horizon utility. In this paper, we propose that optimal budget allocation should be governed by the marginal utility in preserving long-term semantic information. Based on this insight, we propose LU-KV, a novel framework that optimizes head-level budget allocation through a convex-hull relaxation and a marginal-utility-based greedy solver to achieve near-optimal precision. Furthermore, we implement a data-driven offline profiling protocol to facilitate the practical deployment of LU-KV. Extensive evaluations on LongBench and RULER benchmarks demonstrate that LU-KV achieves an 80% reduction in KV cache size with minimal performance degradation, while simultaneously reducing inference latency and GPU memory footprint."}

In this paper, we propose ILA-agent, a general ILA framework that equips LLMs with a set of behavioral primitives. By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment. To provide a rigorous evaluation in a low-resource setting, we construct Cangjie-bench, a multi-task benchmark based on the novel statically-typed language Cangjie. We instantiate ILA-agent for Cangjie and evaluate its performance across code generation, translation, and program repair tasks.

Unlike prior methods, SDN leverages a semantic embedding space to perform stochastic volumetric exploration, provably providing full support over a local trust region. Complementing this, DBU transforms policy optimization into a stable regression task, decoupling gradient variance from action space cardinality and guaranteeing monotonic policy improvement. DGRL naturally generalizes to hybrid continuous-discrete action spaces without requiring hierarchical dependencies. We demonstrate performance improvements of up to 66% against state-of-the-art benchmarks across regularly and irregularly structured environments, while simultaneously improving convergence speed and computational complexity."}

Dey"], "title": "Scalable spatial point process models for forensic footwear analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Shoe print evidence recovered from crime scenes plays a key role in forensic investigations. By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis."}

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE."}

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability."}

CauScale improves time efficiency via a reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps. To keep high causal discovery accuracy, CauScale adopts a two-stream design: a data stream extracts relational evidence from high-dimensional observations, while a graph stream integrates statistical graph priors and preserves key structural signals. CauScale successfully scales to 500-node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations.

A key challenge in unsupervised TSAD is that many anomalies are too subtle to exhibit detectable deviation in any single view (e.g., time domain), and instead manifest as inconsistencies across multiple views like time, frequency, and a mixture of resolutions. However, most cross-view methods rely on feature or score fusion and do not enforce analysis-synthesis consistency, meaning the frequency branch is not required to reconstruct the time signal through an inverse transform, and vice versa. In this paper, we present Learnable Fusion of Tri-view Tokens (LEFT), a unified unsupervised TSAD framework that models anomalies as inconsistencies across complementary representations. LEFT learns feature tokens from three views of the same input time series: frequency-domain tokens that embed periodicity information, time-domain tokens that capture local dynamics, and multi-scale tokens that learns abnormal patterns at varying time series granularities. By learning a set of adaptive Nyquist-constrained spectral filters, the original time series is rescaled into multiple resolutions and then encoded, allowing these multi-scale tokens to complement the extracted frequency- and time-domain information. When generating the fused representation, we introduce a novel objective that reconstructs fine-grained targets from coarser multi-scale structure, and put forward an innovative time-frequency cycle consistency constraint to explicitly regularize cross-view agreement. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that LEFT yields the best detection accuracy against SOTA baselines, while achieving a 5x reduction on FLOPs and 8x speed-up for training."}

We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks."}

Existing fairness notions for generative models are largely adapted from classification and focus on balancing the probability of generating samples from each sensitive group. We show that such criteria are brittle, as they can be met even when different sensitive groups are modeled with widely varying quality. To address this limitation, we introduce a new fairness definition for generative models, termed as equalized generative treatment (EGT), which requires comparable generation quality across all sensitive groups, with quality measured via a reference f-divergence. We further analyze the trade-offs induced by EGT, demonstrating that enforcing fairness constraints necessarily couples the overall model quality to that of the most challenging group to approximate. This indicates that a simple yet efficient min-max fine-tuning method should be able to balance f-divergences across sensitive groups to satisfy EGT. We validate this theoretical insight through a set of experiments on both image and text generation tasks. We demonstrate that min-max methods consistently achieve fairer outcomes compared to other approaches from the literature, while maintaining competitive overall performance for both tasks."}

Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return.

To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable. Designed as an early-stage assistive tool, OMNI-Dent helps users identify potential abnormalities and determine when professional evaluation may be needed, offering a practical option for individuals with limited access to in-person care."}

Existing KV compression methods rely either on static thresholds and attention-only heuristics or on coarse memory budget allocation. Under tight memory budgets, these methods overlook two key factors: prompt-dependent variation in compression risk and functional heterogeneity across attention heads, which destabilize token selection and lead to tail failures. To address these challenges, we propose CompilerKV, a risk-adaptive and head-aware compression framework that compiles offline experience into reusable decision tables for prefill-only deployment. CompilerKV integrates two key synergistic components: (i) a Head Heterogeneity Table, learned via offline contextual bandits, which assigns head-specific reliability weights to govern functional differences across attention heads explicitly; and (ii) a Risk-Adaptive Threshold Gating mechanism that jointly models attention entropy and local perplexity, transforming prompt-level risk into deployable retention thresholds. Experiments on LongBench show CompilerKV dominates SOTA methods under a 512-token budget, recovering 97.7\\% of FullKV performance while achieving up to +5.2 points gain over the strongest competitor."}

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans."}

We propose and systematically evaluate three training-free pipelines: (1) a segmentation-driven rule-based system leveraging pre-trained multi-organ segmentation models, (2) a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) guided by radiologist-defined rules, and (3) a segmentation-aware MLLM that combines visual input with explicit anatomical evidence. All methods are evaluated on 887 heterogeneous CT and MR scans with manually verified anatomical region labels. The segmentation-driven rule-based approach achieves the strongest and most consistent performance, with weighted F1-scores of 0.947 (CT) and 0.914 (MR), demonstrating robustness across modalities and atypical scan coverage.

Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines.

The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training.

By prioritizing these low cosine similarity queries, the behavior of full attention during the prefill stage can be closely approximated. QUOKA leverages this observation, accelerating attention by (1) first retaining a small set of representative queries and (2) then subselectin the keys most aligned with those queries. Through experiments on Needle-In-A-Haystack, LongBench, RULER, and Math500, we show that, while realizing a 3x reduction in time-to-first-token, 5x speedup in attention on Nvidia GPUs and up to nearly a 7x speedup on Intel Xeon CPUs, QUOKA achieves near-baseline accuracy, utilizing 88% fewer key-value pairs per attention evaluation."}

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead.

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off. Our results demonstrate that FADE achieves strong concept erasure and high retainability across various domains, making it a suitable solution for selective unlearning in diffusion-based image generation models."}

As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances. To quantify expressivity needs in practice, we conduct experiments on random instances from the G4SAT benchmark and industrial instances from the International SAT Competition. Our results suggest that while random instances are largely distinguishable, industrial instances often require more expressivity to predict a satisfying assignment."}

Unlike methods that attempt to improve and enrich the $(q,k)$ scoring distribution, FEM treats it as a prior and yields a value-aware posterior read at unchanged complexity, smoothly moving from averaging to per-channel selection as the learnable inverse temperature increases, while still preserving parallelism and the original asymptotic complexity ($O(T^2)$ for softmax; $O(T)$ for linearizable variants). We instantiate a two-level gated FEM that is plug-and-play with standard and linear attention, linear RNNs and SSMs. It consistently outperforms strong baselines on NLP, vision, and time-series at matched parameter budgets."}

We find clear evidence of developer-specific efficiency advantages, but their importance depends on where models lie in the performance distribution. At the frontier, 80-90% of performance differences are explained by higher training compute, implying that scale--not proprietary technology--drives frontier advances. Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds.

While most BO pipelines begin with uniform random initialization, default hyperparameter values shipped with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn encode implicit expert knowledge and could serve as informative starting points that accelerate convergence. This hypothesis, despite its intuitive appeal, has remained largely unexamined. We formalize the idea by initializing BO with points drawn from truncated Gaussian distributions centered at library defaults and compare the resulting trajectories against a uniform-random baseline. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation spanning three BO back-ends (BoTorch, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize), three model families (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons), and five benchmark datasets covering classification and regression tasks. Performance is assessed through convergence speed and final predictive quality, and statistical significance is determined via one-sided binomial tests. Across all conditions, default-informed initialization yields no statistically significant advantage over purely random sampling, with p-values ranging from 0.141 to 0.908. A sensitivity analysis on the prior variance confirms that, while tighter concentration around the defaults improves early evaluations, this transient benefit vanishes as optimization progresses, leaving final performance unchanged. Our results provide no evidence that default hyperparameters encode useful directional information for optimization. We therefore recommend that practitioners treat hyperparameter tuning as an integral part of model development and favor principled, data-driven search strategies over heuristic reliance on library defaults."}

Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations."}

In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%.

Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings."}

However, it remains open whether trained models actually implement simple interpretable programs. In this paper, we present a general method to extract such programs from trained Transformers. The idea is to faithfully re-parameterize a Transformer as a RASP program and then apply causal interventions to discover a small sufficient sub-program. In experiments on small Transformers trained on algorithmic and formal language tasks, we show that our method often recovers simple and interpretable RASP programs from length-generalizing transformers.

In this work, we propose a lightweight post-training pruning framework based on first-order statistical properties of model weights and activations. During pruning, channel-wise statistics are used to calibrate magnitude-based importance scores, reducing bias from activation-dominated channels. After pruning, we apply an analytic energy compensation to correct distributional distortions caused by weight removal. Both steps operate without retraining, gradients, or second-order information. Experiments across multiple LLM families, sparsity patterns, and evaluation tasks show that the proposed approach improves pruning performance while maintaining computational cost comparable to heuristic methods.

FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance.

We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors.

Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny.

We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

To address this issue, we propose LR-DLLM, a length-regularized inference framework for DLLMs that treats generation length as an explicit variable and achieves reliable length determination at inference time. It decouples semantic compatibility from lengthinduced uncertainty through an explicit length regularization that corrects biased confidence estimates. Based on this, LR-DLLM enables dynamic expansion or contraction of the generation span without modifying the underlying DLLM or its training procedure. Experiments show that LRDLLM achieves 51.3% Pass@1 on HumanEvalInfilling under fully unknown lengths (+13.4% vs. DreamOn) and 51.5% average Pass@1 on four-language McEval (+14.3% vs. DreamOn)."}

Code available", "summary": "AI-text detectors face a critical robustness challenge: adversarial paraphrasing attacks that preserve semantics while evading detection. We introduce StealthRL, a reinforcement learning framework that stress-tests detector robustness under realistic adversarial conditions. StealthRL trains a paraphrase policy against a multi-detector ensemble using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with LoRA adapters on Qwen3-4B, optimizing a composite reward that balances detector evasion with semantic preservation. We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results expose significant robustness gaps in current AI-text detection and establish StealthRL as a principled adversarial evaluation protocol.

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation."}

To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical dual-encoder design: a Macro-Encoder to model full-night temporal dependencies and a Micro-Encoder to capture short-term characteristics from biosignals. Macro-Encoder is trained via Demographic-Guided Contrastive Learning, which aligns overnight sleep patterns with objective subject metadata, such as age, sex and BMI to refine global representations. Micro-Encoder is optimized via a hybrid Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and multi-modal contrastive objective.

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives."}

However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation. Through extensive experiments on a newly constructed dataset comprising 88,161 training and 9,819 testing samples across 8 benchmarks with 48,504 unique tables, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods by 7.0% in retrieval recall and 6.1% in answer accuracy, offering a practical solution for real-world table understanding tasks."}

In this work, we first formalize this misalignment and prove that rotary position embedding (RoPE) is mathematically incapable of representing non-affine temporal warping. To address this, we propose Symplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE), a learnable encoding framework derived from Hamiltonian mechanics. SyPE strictly generalizes RoPE by extending the rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ to the symplectic group $\\mathrm{Sp}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, modulated by a novel input-dependent adaptive warp module. By allowing the attention mechanism to adaptively dilate or contract temporal coordinates end-to-end, our approach captures locally varying periodicities without requiring pre-defined warping functions. We implement this mechanism in StretchTime, a multivariate forecasting architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness on datasets exhibiting non-stationary temporal dynamics."}

We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient.

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score. We also show our approach aids convolutional networks on challenging tasks, as in situations with suboptimal encoders or limited data."}

ARO accelerates LLM training by performing normed steepest descent in a rotated coordinate system, where the rotation is determined by a novel norm-informed policy.

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation.

We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving."}

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions.

Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community."}

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents."}

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow."}

Our analysis demonstrates that hand position and movement velocity are especially discriminative in distinguishing between gesture classes, achieving a classification accuracy score of 87%. These findings not only improve the perceptual capabilities of AV systems but also contribute to the broader understanding of pedestrian behaviour in traffic contexts."}

To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking."}

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations."}

We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors. Third, we use this framework to conduct a systematic analysis of token-level adaptive computation across alignment with complexity, generalization, and decision timing. Our results show that compute allocation aligned with task complexity can emerge without explicit difficulty supervision, but such alignment does not imply algorithmic generalization: models fail to extrapolate to unseen input sizes despite allocating additional computation. We further find that early compute decisions rely on static structural cues, whereas online halting more closely tracks algorithmic execution state."}

We term these Rendering-Optimal References (RORs) and analyze their statistical properties, revealing stable patterns: mixture-structured scales and bimodal radiance across diverse scenes. To understand what determines these parameters, we apply learnability probes by training predictors to reconstruct RORs from point clouds without rendering supervision. Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions. This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential. We provide density-aware strategies that improve training robustness and discuss architectural implications for systems that adaptively balance feed-forward prediction and rendering-based refinement."}

The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.
