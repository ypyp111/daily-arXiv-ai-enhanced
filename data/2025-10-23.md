Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的隐形标记，能自然地融入现实环境，提供隐蔽的6自由度位置追踪，适用于AR、机器人等领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标记在美学上过于显眼，在某些场景中不受欢迎，需要开发能自然融入环境的隐形标记。

Method: 使用端到端的深度隐写术方法，通过编码器网络将任意图像转换为Ninja Codes，并联合训练创建和检测模块。

Result: 实验表明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能提供可靠的位置追踪，同时成功隐藏在多样环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在传统标记因外观显眼而不适用的场景中具有特殊价值，能提供隐蔽的位置追踪解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段的自动驾驶视觉语言问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，显著提升了高级感知、预测和规划问题的回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决自动驾驶中高级感知、预测和规划问题的视觉语言问答挑战，通过增强上下文信息和优化提示工程来提升模型性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用大型多模态LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-32B）处理六摄像头输入和历史时序信息，结合思维链提示和自一致性集成；第二阶段通过添加场景元数据和任务特定指令进一步优化。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中显著超越基线模型，第一阶段使用5帧历史和10-shot提示达到65.1%准确率，自一致性提升至66.85%，第二阶段达到67.37%，在严重视觉干扰下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和上下文增强可以大幅提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [DARE: A Deformable Adaptive Regularization Estimator for Learning-Based Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19353)
*Ahsan Raza Siyal,Markus Haltmeier,Ruth Steiger,Malik Galijasevic,Elke Ruth Gizewski,Astrid Ellen Grams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARE是一个可变形医学图像配准框架，通过动态调整弹性正则化来平衡稳定性和灵活性，包含折叠预防机制确保物理真实的变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像配准中往往忽视正则化的重要性，导致缺乏鲁棒性和解剖学合理性。

Method: 提出DARE框架，基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，集成应变和剪切能量项，并包含折叠预防机制惩罚负变形雅可比区域。

Result: 该方法减轻了非物理伪影如折叠，避免过度平滑，提高了配准精度和解剖学合理性。

Conclusion: DARE通过自适应正则化策略在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和解剖学合理性。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

### [5] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D是一种新颖的状态空间架构，用于纵向医学图像分析，能够有效处理高分辨率图像序列和不规则时间间隔，在乳腺癌风险预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向分析序列医学图像面临数据挑战：如何有效建模高分辨率图像序列和不规则时间间隔。现有方法要么压缩空间信息，要么使用计算效率低且不兼容非均匀时间步的时空模型。

Method: 提出Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，采用连续时间选择性扫描机制，将真实检查时间差整合到状态转换中，并配备多尺度3D邻域融合模块来捕获时空关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，该模型表现优异，验证c-index提高2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分高于现有的循环、transformer和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型凭借线性复杂度能够高效处理长而复杂的患者筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间来改进文本到视频扩散模型，使其生成更具时间一致性和物理合理性的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型在生成复杂运动时缺乏时间一致性和物理合理性，主要原因是模型对自然视频中复杂运动的理解不足。现有方法通过将扩散模型特征与预训练视频编码器特征对齐，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态信息，限制了对齐效果。

Method: 提出运动中心对齐框架：1）从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，该子空间通过预测真实光流进行优化以确保捕捉真实运动动态；2）将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与这个新子空间对齐，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试中改进了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识，同时保持了与文本提示的契合度，用户研究也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过解耦运动子空间的对齐方法，能够有效提升文本到视频扩散模型生成视频的时间一致性和物理合理性，同时不损害与文本提示的匹配度。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [7] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLM作为评判者，相比现有指标能更好地反映人类评分。同时提出了DOCENT数据集来验证该指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像描述评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本中的属性和关系错误，需要更细粒度的错误定位能力。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，指导大型语言模型作为评判者进行细粒度错误分析。同时构建了DOCENT数据集，包含艺术作品、专家参考描述和艺术史学生的质量评估。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类评估的相关性比最佳开源替代指标高0.05 Spearman ρ，对不同类型的图像都表现稳健，并能作为有效的奖励函数。

Conclusion: PoSh是一个可复制、可解释的评估指标，能更好地反映人类评分，为详细图像描述评估提供了新的基准。通过PoSh和DOCENT，可以推动辅助文本生成等重要领域的发展。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR是一个统一的人体姿态表示学习框架，通过创新的基于奇异值的对比学习损失，对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，在人体姿态估计任务中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对不同模态人体姿态表示之间相关性的系统研究，特别是在对比学习范式下。人体姿态表示作为人本应用的重要组成部分，需要统一的表示框架来支持多模态融合和生成。

Method: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习管道，使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失来同时对齐多个数据表示，包括图像、2D和3D人体姿态。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm（跨域评估）。同时实现了2D和3D姿态检索，检索误差为9.24mm MPJPE。

Conclusion: UniHPR通过创新的对比学习损失有效对齐了多模态人体姿态表示，在人体姿态估计和姿态检索任务中表现出色，为多模态人体姿态分析提供了统一的表示框架。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在脑肿瘤分割中难以准确描绘不规则形状和模糊边界，且处理高分辨率MRI数据需要大量计算资源并面临类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并优先处理信息丰富区域；同时使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

TL;DR: 本研究应用联邦近端学习(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据，结合改进的U-Net模型和注意力机制，在保护患者隐私的同时实现了96%的肿瘤分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。超声成像作为可靠且经济有效的工具，但医疗数据的敏感性使得开发准确且私密的人工智能模型具有挑战性。联邦学习虽然能保护患者隐私，但在非独立同分布数据集上训练会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 应用联邦近端学习(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，并采用改进的U-Net模型结合注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割精度。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型具有巨大潜力，能够平衡隐私保护和模型性能的需求。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和跨自我对比学习(CECL)方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，通过同步的第一人称视角视频流促进团队战术意识学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解研究大多依赖第三人称视角，忽视了多智能体学习的同步自我中心特性。团队战术源于每个玩家的个体视角及其预测、解释和适应队友意图的能力。

Method: 引入X-Ego-CS数据集，包含45场职业级Counter-Strike 2比赛的124小时游戏录像，提供同步的第一人称视角视频流和状态-动作轨迹。提出跨自我对比学习(CECL)，通过对齐队友的自我中心视觉流来培养团队战术情境意识。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台，对虚拟和现实领域的时空推理和人机协作具有意义。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

motion dynamics directly from visual input. On multiple datasets, FootFormer
achieves statistically significantly better or equivalent estimates of foot
pressure distributions, foot contact maps, and center of mass (CoM), as
compared with existing methods that generate one or two of those measures.
Furthermore, FootFormer achieves SOTA performance in estimating
stability-predictive components (CoP, CoM, BoS) used in classic kinesiology
metrics. Code and data are available at

### [13] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN）来自动检测疟疾感染的血细胞图像，其中残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾诊断依赖专家手动观察血涂片图像，缺乏专业知识可能导致误诊。因此需要计算机辅助的自动诊断方法来提高准确性和减少人工参与。

Method: 使用六种深度卷积网络从血细胞图像中提取深层特征，并将其分类为疟疾感染细胞或健康细胞。

Result: 残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最好，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的自动检测方法在疟疾诊断中具有现实可行性，能够实现可靠检测并最小化人工参与。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练、基于自适应KV缓存剪枝的方法，通过增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注来减轻多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题仍然是一个主要挑战，现有解决方案要么需要额外训练数据，要么在推理时引入额外计算成本。研究发现幻觉与模型对视觉token注意力不足密切相关，冗余的视觉token分散了模型注意力。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存剪枝来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注。该方法无需额外训练，几乎不增加推理成本，且与不同解码策略兼容。

Result: 在多个主流幻觉评估基准上使用四种主流MLLMs进行评估，获得了稳健且出色的结果，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将token剪枝应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有训练无关、低计算成本和模型无关的优点，能有效减轻幻觉问题。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时序一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务中的时序一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于奖励的微调方法主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量提升，但在图像到视频生成任务中时序一致性往往受到影响，需要专门解决时序一致性的方法。

Method: 提出VCD指标，在视频帧特征频率空间中定义，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，结合基于奖励的微调框架对视频生成模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验结果表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著提升了时序一致性，且不会降低其他性能表现。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的时序一致性增强指标，能够在不牺牲其他性能的前提下显著改善图像到视频生成任务的时序一致性。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于增强下游感知任务的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和3D资产渲染生成多视角真实视频，显著提升自动驾驶中的边缘案例感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务的评估。现有方法通常采用先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调的策略，导致训练周期加倍，当基线方法也加倍训练周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型以生成编辑后的多视角真实视频，这些视频可用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: Dream4Drive能够以前所未有的灵活性大规模生成多视角边缘案例，显著提升自动驾驶中的边缘案例感知能力。实验表明，Dream4Drive在各种训练周期下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能。

Conclusion: Dream4Drive提供了一个有效的合成数据生成框架，能够显著增强自动驾驶下游感知任务的性能，特别是在边缘案例处理方面。同时贡献了DriveObj3D大规模3D资产数据集，为未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景中表现不一致，缺乏能有效处理所有动态挑战的统一方法。

Method: 使用专家混合框架，通过体积感知像素路由器将高斯级权重投影到像素空间，实现专家输出的自适应融合；采用单次多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略优化效率。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的实验表明，MoE-GS在保持效率的同时，持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将专家混合技术整合到动态高斯溅射中的方法，通过统一的专家融合框架显著提升了动态场景重建的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达融合检测网络，通过估计物体二次曲面参数增强空间表示和跨模态交互，生成密集伪点云缓解雷达点稀疏问题，在BEV空间实现多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、远距离检测和精确速度测量等优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示和多模态融合效果。

Method: 通过图像和雷达数据估计物体二次曲面参数，生成密集伪点云；使用预测深度指导图像特征从透视视图到BEV空间的转换；采用基于柱体的方法处理点云特征，最后使用标准2D骨干网络和检测头进行预测。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft (VoD)物体检测基准测试中表现出优越性能，有效融合了相机和4D雷达特征。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合引导的多模态融合方法，成功解决了4D雷达点云稀疏性问题，提升了物体检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了GEO空间目标检测中的关键问题，通过小波变换和优化的多帧匹配策略显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

TL;DR: FadeLead是一个前景感知协作感知框架，通过在训练过程中学习将背景上下文信息封装到紧凑的前景特征中，解决了传统方法丢弃背景信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作感知通过车辆间共享互补信息提升自动驾驶的可靠性，但带宽限制使得传输完整特征图不可行。现有方法只传输前景区域特征而丢弃了包含重要上下文的背景信息。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，而不传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 上下文增强的前景共享方法有效提升了协作感知性能。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Conclusion: MobiAct框架在MAV动作识别中实现了高精度、低能耗和快速推理的平衡，特别适合资源受限的MAV平台。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二元指示器，在推理时优化预训练T2I模型的噪声先验。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升对象计数准确率（如D2D-Small基准提升13.7%），图像质量和计算开销影响很小。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功解决了T2I扩散模型在生成正确对象数量方面的挑战，通过利用检测模型的计数能力实现了显著改进。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled

privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications

Abstract: Mistake analysis in procedural activities is a critical area of research with
applications spanning industrial automation, physical rehabilitation, education
and human-robot collaboration. This paper reviews vision-based methods for
detecting and predicting mistakes in structured tasks, focusing on procedural
and executional errors. By leveraging advancements in computer vision,
including action recognition, anticipation and activity understanding,
vision-based systems can identify deviations in task execution, such as
incorrect sequencing, use of improper techniques, or timing errors. We explore
the challenges posed by intra-class variability, viewpoint differences and
compositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection.
Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets,
evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based
on their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning
strategies. Open challenges, such as distinguishing permissible variations from
true mistakes and modeling error propagation are discussed alongside future

TL;DR: 提出统一的强化与模仿学习(RIL)算法，通过结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，使轻量级视觉语言模型能够模仿大型教师模型的文本生成能力，并提升生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)虽然取得了显著进展，但其大规模特性在资源受限环境中不实用，需要开发高效的训练算法来创建强大的轻量级VLMs。

Method: RIL算法结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，使用基于LLM的判别器区分学生和教师输出，并利用多个大型教师VLM提供多样化指导。

Result: 在多种视觉语言基准测试中，RIL显著缩小了与最先进开源和闭源VLMs的性能差距，并在多个实例中超越了它们。

Conclusion: 统一的强化与模仿学习策略使学生模型获得显著性能提升，使其能够与领先的闭源VLMs竞争。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，能够同时从遥感图像预测水深和海底分类，通过跨任务特征融合和动态任务权重平衡，显著提升了浅水环境测绘的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法将水深估计和海底分类作为独立任务处理，忽视了它们之间的相互作用，限制了深度学习方法在浅水环境测绘中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和像素级海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性权重平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质海岸站点的广泛评估中，相比传统经验模型和机器学习回归方法，RMSE降低高达75%；相比最先进的单任务和多任务基线，水深RMSE降低10-30%，海底分类精度提升高达8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需单独的VAE通路即可实现高质量的图像解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，并添加参数密集的VAE管道来捕捉视觉细节，但这忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富对象信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统的功能层次结构，将来自不同视觉区域（低/高级）的fMRI信号与相应的CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，引入跨重建策略和新的多粒度损失函数。

Result: BrainMCLIP在高级语义指标上达到或超越最先进方法，同时参数数量减少了71.7%，无需VAE管道即可有效捕捉视觉细节。

Conclusion: 通过利用CLIP中间特征，BrainMCLIP在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡，无需单独的VAE管道。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: AegisRF是一种保护NeRF模型知识产权的框架，通过注入对抗性扰动来破坏未经授权的下游应用，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF在3D场景表示和视图合成中的广泛应用，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得至关重要。现有方法避免几何扰动或限制在显式空间中，因为这会严重降低渲染质量。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场和敏感度场。扰动场在NeRF预渲染输出中注入对抗性扰动，敏感度场学习空间变化的敏感度来自适应约束几何扰动，在保持渲染质量的同时破坏未经授权使用。

Result: 实验评估表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有通用适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF成功解决了NeRF知识产权保护问题，通过自适应约束几何扰动，在保持渲染质量的同时有效破坏未经授权的下游应用。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

Motivation: 当前VLM评估主要关注单视角设置，而多摄像头设置已成为机器人平台标准配置，但VLM能否有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 构建包含1.7k手动标注QA项的MV-RoboBench基准，涵盖八个子任务，分为空间理解和机器人执行两大类，评估了包括开源和闭源模型在内的多种VLM。

Result: 最先进模型表现远低于人类性能，发现了两个关键发现：多视角机器人场景中空间智能与机器人任务执行正相关；现有通用单视角空间理解基准的强性能不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: VLM在多视角机器人感知方面面临重大挑战，MV-RoboBench作为开放资源将促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展，提供标准化评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决真实世界IC缺陷分类中的高度不平衡数据问题提供了有效解决方案，提出的数据集和模型在应对类内多样性和类间相似性挑战方面表现出色。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

TL;DR: 提出多条件生成对抗网络框架，生成具有精确控制特性的代表性孔隙尺度图像，解决地下表征中的代表性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取真正代表地层特性的孔隙尺度图像存在挑战，因为自然空间异质性导致提取的子图像与岩心测量值显著偏离，且物理样本仅在稀疏井位可用。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络，在单一统一模型中同时以孔隙度值和深度参数为条件，训练于碳酸盐岩地层的薄片样本。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了优异的孔隙度控制（R^2=0.95），平均绝对误差0.0099-0.0197，生成图像的代表性误差仅为1.9-11.3%，远优于随机提取真实子图像的36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成式AI的MRI加速新范式，从图像重建转向预测性成像，通过生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，显著提升高倍加速下的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间过长限制了临床效率，传统图像重建方法在高倍加速下效果有限，需要新的方法来克服这一瓶颈。

Method: 使用生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，条件输入包括其他对比度图像、历史扫描图像、采集参数和患者信息，然后基于此先验重建高度欠采样的k空间数据。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在x4、x8和x12高加速因子下，该方法显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本性转变，为MRI加速提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

TL;DR: PRGCN是一个新的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过跨序列模式重用和记忆驱动的图卷积来解决深度模糊问题，在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准上达到了新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目3D人体姿态估计中固有的深度模糊问题，现有视频方法仅处理孤立序列，未能利用跨序列中普遍存在的结构规律性和重复运动模式。

Method: 提出模式重用图卷积网络(PRGCN)，包含图记忆库学习姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索，结合双流混合架构融合Mamba状态空间模型的自注意力和局部时间建模。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准上分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，建立了新的最先进水平，并展现出增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动该领域发展至关重要，将范式从每序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提出通过插补和加权重采样方法消除甲烷羽流检测中标签与覆盖率之间的虚假关联，从而提升低覆盖率图像中的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像中由于云层等因素导致的系统性缺失像素（非随机缺失数据）会导致自动化特征提取模型出现表示偏差。在甲烷羽流检测中，标签与缺失值数量之间的虚假关联会使模型将图像覆盖率与标签关联，导致在低覆盖率图像中漏检羽流。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法以消除覆盖率与标签之间的依赖关系，并提出在训练期间使用加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间内强制执行类别平衡来移除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 结果显示重采样和插补都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景下的评估表明，使用这些技术去偏的模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的概率更高。

Conclusion: 通过插补和重采样方法可以有效解决卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提升甲烷羽流检测模型在低覆盖率图像中的性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流方法通过数据增强缓解域差异，但由于域偏移和有限域知识，模型容易陷入伪相关陷阱，过度依赖简单分类特征而非本质的域不变表示。

Method: 提出Cauvis方法：1）交叉注意力提示模块，通过视觉提示与交叉注意力结合减轻伪特征偏差；2）双分支适配器，通过高频特征提取实现域适应，同时分离因果-伪特征。

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上相比现有域泛化方法获得15.9-31.4%的性能提升，在复杂干扰环境中表现出显著鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，通过因果视觉提示实现了更好的域泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致97-99%的token都是视觉token，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像已足够。

Method: 使用紧凑VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应何时收敛到其峰值回答能力，作为离散分类器训练但可在推理时插值连续分辨率。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试中，CARES在保持任务性能的同时，将计算量减少高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择最小足够分辨率，有效解决了VLM中视觉token过多导致的计算效率问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理小重叠或无重叠图像对时效果不佳，视频插值生成的中间帧模糊且选择策略效率低，需要更清晰的中间帧生成和更有效的选择方法。

Method: 使用混合视频生成(HVG)结合视频插值模型和姿态条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中间帧，并设计基于特征对应的特征匹配选择器(FMS)选择适合姿态估计的帧。

Result: 在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上的实验表明，相比现有SOTA方法，PoseCrafter显著提升了姿态估计性能，尤其在小重叠或无重叠情况下。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过改进的中间帧生成和选择策略，有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机姿态估计难题。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现优异，但在视觉推理方面仍存在诸多限制，特别是难以识别关系、理解时间序列和计数物体。本文旨在超越基准评估，深入探究这些失败的根本原因。

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究7个最先进视觉语言模型的计数推理能力，进行分层分析，并通过仅微调输出层进行针对性训练。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感，错误主要源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题。仅微调输出层可使准确率提升高达21%。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的推理失败主要源于输出映射问题，通过针对性微调输出层可显著提升性能，这一发现在真实数据集上得到了验证。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Motivation: 研究大规模视觉语言模型（如CLIP）是否具备时间感知能力，即能否将视觉内容定位到特定时间点，这对于理解模型的多模态表示能力具有重要意义。

Method: 引入TIME10k基准数据集（包含10,000多张带时间标注的图像），评估37个VLM的时间感知能力，并提出从嵌入空间提取显式时间线表示的方法。

Result: 发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中呈低维非线性流形分布，提出的时间线方法在时间推理任务中相比基于提示的基线方法达到竞争性甚至更优的准确率，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型确实具备时间感知能力，时间信息在嵌入空间中有规律可循，提出的时间线表示方法能有效支持时间推理任务。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势（RGB提供高空间分辨率和纹理细节，事件相机提供高时间分辨率和动态范围），但两者存在显著的时空不对称性，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: HAD框架采用分层非对称蒸馏方法，通过分层对齐策略最小化信息损失，同时保持学生网络的计算效率和参数紧凑性。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD持续优于最先进方法，消融研究验证了各设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD成功解决了RGB和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，为多模态目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 随着物体检测模型在自动驾驶汽车等网络物理系统中的部署增加，确保其对抗性威胁的安全性变得至关重要。现有研究主要关注图像域的攻击，而视频域的无盒攻击尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Result: 在五种最先进的物体检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型上评估，攻击成功率100%，揭示了视频感知系统中先前未被探索的漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频感知系统中alpha通道在对抗性环境中的新漏洞，强调了开发考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法，验证了VGD的可扩展性和高保真环视重建能力

Conclusion: VGD框架通过显式几何学习和特征一致性学习，有效解决了环视自动驾驶场景重建中的关键挑战

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法在多焦点图像融合复杂挑战方面取得了重要进展，为处理不同焦点图像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

*Su Ho Han,Jeongseok Hyun,Pilhyeon Lee,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF)方法，通过对比性对象-背景融合和互补视频帧融合机制，将多模态大语言模型的注意力图直接转换为视频分割掩码，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现强大，但其原始注意力图存在噪声且与对象区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来改进这些注意力图以进行视频分割。

Method: 使用rollout机制提取注意力图，通过DecAF的两个机制进行精炼：(1)对比性对象-背景融合抑制无关激活，(2)互补视频帧融合增强对象焦点线索，并结合注意力引导的SAM2提示获得细粒度掩码。

Result: DecAF在参考和推理VOS基准测试中优于无需训练的方法，性能与基于训练的方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需重新训练MLLMs的视频分割，展示了注意力图直接转换为分割掩码的可行性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过条件伯努利扩散模型生成多个多样化的伪造定位图，解决传统方法单一确定性预测的局限性，显著提升图像伪造定位的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像伪造定位方法生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏精确性和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。需要解决伪造区域固有的不确定性和变异性问题。

Method: CBDiff模型：1）使用条件伯努利扩散模型生成多个多样化定位图；2）在扩散过程中引入伯努利噪声以更好反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性；3）提出时间步交叉注意力机制，利用语义特征和时序信息改进篡改检测。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有的最先进方法，显示出在实际部署中的强大潜力。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个多样化定位图有效解决了伪造定位中的不确定性，为高风险应用提供了更可靠和全面的伪造检测解决方案。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准XBench，用于评估胸部X射线中跨模态可解释性，发现当前视觉语言模型在医学图像中的定位能力存在不足，特别是对于小病灶或弥散性病变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解方面表现出色，但其定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未充分探索。在医学领域，可靠的定位对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域在多种病理中的对齐程度，评估了七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体。

Result: 发现：(1)所有VLM变体对于大而明确的病理表现出合理的定位能力，但对于小或弥散性病变性能显著下降；(2)在胸部X射线特定数据集上预训练的模型比通用领域训练的模型具有更好的对齐；(3)模型的整体识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管具有较强的识别能力，但在临床可靠的定位方面仍然不足，强调了在医学实践中部署前需要有针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来抑制高斯噪声，在卡通图像去噪中达到了极小极大渐近界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器在框架中无法充分适应复杂信号规律性，特别是对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2是未知参数时，小波、曲波等框架都是次优的。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来构建去噪估计器。

Result: 数值实验表明，该去噪估计器对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都达到了极小极大渐近界。

Conclusion: 该方法为抑制信号噪声和指定函数几何规律性提供了不同的调和分析方法，并在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Motivation: 解决异构智能体协作中的领域差距问题，现有方法存在破坏语义一致性和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 使用可变形消息提取器提取空间消息，基于条件扩散模型的空间感知特征生成器生成与自我智能体语义空间对齐的特征，通过通道增强器进行特征优化。

Result: 在OPV2V-H、DAIR-V2X和V2X-Real数据集上表现优于现有方法，集成新智能体时计算成本和参数数量减少81%。

Conclusion: GenComm提供了一种高效、可扩展的异构多智能体协作解决方案，显著降低了计算成本并保持了语义一致性。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有时刻检索方法面临的三个关键问题：数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联、相邻事件间的边界模糊、以及细粒度语义区分不足。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义感知；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比之前的最先进方法实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: AMR框架能够在不依赖外部数据的情况下有效解决时刻检索中的边界模糊和语义混淆问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在医学领域表现不佳，主要由于缺乏大规模高质量医学影像数据集和忽视了从粗到细的诊断过程。

Method: 构建CT-RATE-VQA数据集（84K QA对），提出MedReason-R1模型，嵌入放大病灶区域，并引入GRPO强化学习框架。

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过强调全局定位和疾病特异性细节，有效提升了医学诊断性能，无需依赖昂贵的人工标注。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和参数扰动机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的梯度稀释和基元冻结问题，有效消除了过重构伪影，在保持几何细节的同时实现了最先进的视图合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中会出现过重构伪影（局部模糊和针状扭曲），现有方法归因于大规模高斯分裂不足，但本文发现两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和基元冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1) 重要性感知致密化准则，结合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的基元生长；(2) 重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的基元。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重构伪影，在标准新视图合成指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持了精细的几何细节。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS的重新激活机制在其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）中也带来了一致的改进，证明了其广泛的适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法会扭曲细长曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为重要。

Method: CST框架通过增加曲线结构提取模块提供拓扑监督，可无缝集成到现有方法中，已集成到CycleGAN和UNSB两种代表性骨干网络中。

Result: 在光学相干断层扫描血管成像、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影三种成像模态上的评估表明，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CST通过增强学习映射中的几何完整性，为医学影像中曲线结构感知的跨域翻译建立了原则性途径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的活体检测系统多为黑盒模型，决策过程不透明，需要解释性技术来理解系统行为

Method: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，为深度学习人脸活体检测系统提供视觉解释，识别图像中被系统判定为真实或伪造的关键区域

Result: 该方法能够提供详细的视觉解释，帮助理解深度学习活体检测系统的决策依据

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM提高了深度学习人脸活体检测系统的透明度和可信度，有助于更好地理解系统行为

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，有效抑制视觉干扰因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量具有挑战性，因为存在背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等干扰视觉因素。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序Transformer自编码器通过全局注意力聚焦动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并用Lyapunov稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和Transformer基线中具有最低的分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生既准确又物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出ADQ自适应分布感知量化框架，解决激活值分布高度不均匀和权重量化码本不匹配问题，在ImageNet上ResNet-18仅用2.81比特平均位宽达到71.512%准确率

Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法面临两个主要挑战：激活值分布高度不均匀，以及权重量化中使用的静态、不匹配码本

Method: 采用差异化策略的混合精度量化框架，包含三个关键创新：分位数初始化方法、基于指数移动平均的在线码本自适应机制、敏感度指导的混合精度分配策略，以及硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射方案

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18仅用2.81比特平均位宽达到71.512% Top-1准确率，优于同类最先进方法；在CIFAR-10上的消融研究验证了各创新组件的独立贡献

Conclusion: ADQ框架通过自适应权重量化方案和硬件友好的激活值处理，有效解决了量化中的分布不均匀和码本不匹配问题，在保持低比特位宽的同时实现了优异的性能

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X通过统一框架和高质量数据集，在多模态人体运动生成任务中表现出色，为动画制作提供了强大工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练和部署分布不一致时性能会下降，现有测试时适应方法忽视了长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类别混淆问题。

Method: 使用类感知原型缓存模块动态调整每类容量，包含基于测试频率和激活历史的容量分配机制；采用负对比学习机制识别和约束困难视觉-文本负样本；采用非对称优化，仅优化文本原型而固定视觉特征。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC是一个轻量级的测试时适应框架，能有效提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，特别是针对长尾分布和语义相似类别混淆问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

Method: 使用专门的源代码和自然语言数据集，对预训练的编码器专用小型语言模型（RoBERTa和CodeBERTa）进行微调，用于二元分类任务。

Result: 编码器模型在AUROC指标上达到0.97-0.99，宏F1分数达到0.89-0.94，同时延迟降低8-12倍，峰值VRAM减少3-5倍。在跨生成器迁移和对抗性转换下，性能保持原始AUROC的92%以上。

Conclusion: 对于二元分类任务，小型语言模型在显著减少计算资源的同时，性能大幅优于大型语言模型，为机器生成内容检测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [81] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase是一个模型无关框架，利用大语言模型将原始推文重述为更标准化的语言，以提升主题建模在社交媒体短文本分析中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体短文本（如推文）的简洁性、非正式性和噪声阻碍了传统主题建模的有效性，导致主题不连贯、冗余且难以解释。

Method: 开发TM-Rephrase框架，使用两种重述策略（通用重述和口语到正式重述）处理25,027条COVID-19相关推文，并比较多种主题建模方法的效果。

Result: TM-Rephrase提高了主题一致性、独特性和多样性，减少了主题冗余，其中口语到正式重述策略对LDA算法效果提升最显著。

Conclusion: 该研究为公共卫生相关社交媒体分析提供了一种模型无关的方法来增强主题建模，对改善健康危机及其他重要领域的公共话语理解具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

TL;DR: 提出了正交多样性感知选择（ODiS）算法，通过主成分分析将多维度评分解相关，确保预训练数据在质量和多样性上的平衡选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分数的数据选择方法存在偏差，将相关维度压缩导致忽视多样性，直接选择高分数据反而降低性能，需要更平衡的方法。

Method: ODiS算法：1）多维度评估数据质量；2）用PCA解相关评分；3）训练Roberta评分器预测PCA投影分数；4）在各正交维度选择高分数据构建训练集。

Result: ODiS选择的数据维度间重叠小于2%，验证了正交性。使用ODiS数据训练的模型在下游基准测试中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 正交、多样性感知的数据选择对LLM预训练至关重要，ODiS算法能有效平衡数据质量和多样性。

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态可逆的剪枝框架，通过检测上下文感知的神经元激活并应用自适应掩码来调节生成过程中的影响，实现推理时的细粒度偏见缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型内部表示中存在不良行为，影响公平性、一致性，并放大有害内容。现有训练时方法计算成本高且不可逆，静态剪枝方法缺乏适应性。

Method: 使用动态可逆剪枝框架，检测上下文感知的神经元激活，应用自适应掩码来调节生成过程中的神经元影响，实现推理时的偏见控制。

Result: 该方法在单轮和多轮多语言对话中实现了细粒度、内存感知的偏见缓解，同时保持了知识完整性，行为更加一致。

Conclusion: 提出的推理时解决方案能够实现动态公平控制，为实际对话AI系统提供了灵活、可适应的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型正从单模态理解向统一视觉、音频和语言模态的全模态模型发展，但单模态与全模态之间的相关性尚不明确，需要全面评估来推动全模态模型的智能演进。

Method: 构建了包含1880个人工标注样本的基准测试，涵盖44种任务类型，并创新性地引入了多步骤开放式问题类型，以更好地评估复杂推理任务。

Result: 实验结果显示跨模态和单模态性能之间存在组合规律，全模态能力在弱模型上表现为瓶颈效应，而在强模型上则表现出协同促进作用。

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench是一个高质量、多样化的全模态基准测试，能够有效评估单模态和全模态理解能力，揭示了全模态能力在不同模型强度下的不同表现模式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Transformer预训练语言模型的可解释且计算高效的虚假信息检测流水线，通过两阶段微调策略优化RoBERTa和DistilBERT，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台虚假信息的快速传播破坏了用户信任并阻碍明智决策，需要开发高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段微调策略：先冻结主干网络训练分类头，然后逐步解冻主干层并应用分层学习率衰减；集成LIME进行token级解释和SHAP进行全局特征归因。

Result: 在COVID Fake News和FakeNewsNet GossipCop数据集上，DistilBERT达到与RoBERTa相当的准确率，同时显著减少计算资源需求。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型结合原则性微调和可解释性可以成为可扩展、可信赖的虚假信息检测的有效框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在复杂任务中的创意能力通常需要难以扩展的人工评估，需要开发可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析叙事中带符号角色网络（包括密度、聚类、带符号边权重等网络属性）来评估LLM故事生成，比较了四个领先LLM和人类写作语料库的1200多个故事。

Result: LLM生成的故事一致表现出强烈的紧密积极关系偏见，这与之前使用人工评估的研究发现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估当前和未来LLM创意讲故事的局限性和倾向提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

TL;DR: SLIM框架通过分离搜索和浏览工具、定期总结轨迹来解决长轨迹搜索中的上下文限制问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低成本和工具调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理搜索框架在长轨迹搜索中面临上下文限制问题，包括积累冗长嘈杂内容、超出上下文窗口和工具预算、过早停止等。

Method: 引入SLIM框架，将检索分离为独立的搜索和浏览工具，并定期总结轨迹，保持上下文简洁的同时支持更长、更专注的搜索。

Result: 在长时域任务上，SLIM以显著更低的成本和更少的工具调用达到可比性能。使用o3基础模型时，在BrowseComp和HLE上分别达到56%和31%，优于所有开源框架，同时工具调用减少4-6倍。

Conclusion: SLIM展示了更少的幻觉，作者希望分析框架和简单工具设计能为未来长时域代理提供参考。

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估主要局限于数学、编程等容易验证的任务，而现实应用需要评估模型处理专业文档和生成综合报告的能力。

Method: 构建ProfBench基准，包含物理、化学、金融和咨询领域的专家评估数据，并开发经济高效的LLM-Judge评估系统，通过减轻自我增强偏见将评估成本降低2-3个数量级。

Result: ProfBench对最先进的大语言模型构成显著挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5-high模型仅达到65.9%的整体性能，并发现专有模型与开源模型之间存在明显性能差距。

Conclusion: ProfBench为专业领域任务评估提供了公平可访问的基准，揭示了扩展思维在处理复杂专业任务中的重要作用。

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型对良性提示的防御性拒绝问题，以及现有静态基准随时间退化导致数据污染和评估能力下降的问题。

Method: 开发动态生成模型特定挑战性数据集的框架，捕捉新兴防御模式并与每个模型的独特行为对齐。

Result: 构建了OVERBENCH基准，聚合了多样化LLM家族的数据集，提供了对过度敏感性的动态和演化视角。

Conclusion: OVERBENCH能够持续监控模型发展中的防御触发因素，突出静态数据集忽略的脆弱性。

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在人类-AI交互中的广泛应用，评估其在人际语境中的社会推理能力变得至关重要。

Method: 构建了包含1,000个英语和韩语对话的SCRIPTS数据集，源自电影剧本，要求模型推断对话者之间的人际关系，并由母语者标注概率性关系标签。

Result: 评估九个模型发现，专有大语言模型在英语数据集上达到75-80%准确率，但在韩语上降至58-69%。模型在10-25%的响应中选择了不可能的关系。思维模型和思维链提示对社会推理帮助有限，有时还会放大社会偏见。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型的社会推理能力存在显著局限性，需要开发更具社会意识的语言模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在生物医学术语标准化任务中的表现，发现微调效果取决于标识符的流行度和词汇化程度，基因符号表现最佳，而GO和HPO等非词汇化标识符效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据集成依赖于术语标准化，将自然语言术语映射到标准化标识符。大型语言模型在此任务中表现不一，需要评估其在不同术语体系中的记忆和泛化能力。

Method: 使用Llama 3.1 8B模型在多个生物医学本体上进行微调，评估记忆能力（训练术语表现）和泛化能力（验证术语表现），并进行嵌入分析。

Result: GO术语的记忆能力显著提升（准确率提高77%），HPO提升有限；只有基因-蛋白质映射实现了泛化（提升13.9%）。GPT-4o在所有术语上都优于Llama变体。

Conclusion: 微调成功取决于标识符流行度和词汇化程度：流行标识符增强记忆，词汇化标识符（如基因符号）支持语义泛化，而任意标识符（如GO、HPO）限制模型只能死记硬背。

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在参数知识与提示中冲突信息不一致时的行为表现，提出了一个领域无关的框架来构建和解释知识冲突，并在代码生成场景中进行了实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前问答研究，将知识冲突研究扩展到代码生成领域，探索LLMs如何处理参数知识与提示信息之间的冲突。

Method: 提出了领域无关的知识冲突构建框架、新颖的评估方法和针对代码冲突场景的数据集，使用激活级引导技术进行实验。

Result: 实验表明足够大的LLMs在其参数中编码了知识冲突的概念，检测知识冲突的准确率可达80.65%，激活级引导相比随机基线可提升12.6%的引导成功率。

Conclusion: LLMs能够识别知识冲突，激活级引导技术有效但效果取决于模型大小、任务领域和引导方向的平衡。

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

*Valentin Noël*

TL;DR: 提出基于谱分析的框架，通过将transformer层建模为注意力诱导的动态图，利用图信号处理定义诊断指标来检测大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在取得显著成果的同时，区分事实推理与幻觉仍然具有挑战性，需要开发有效的检测方法。

Method: 将transformer层建模为注意力诱导的动态图，以token嵌入作为图上的信号，通过图信号处理定义Dirichlet能量、谱熵和高频能量比等诊断指标。

Result: 实验发现事实陈述呈现一致的"能量山"行为，而不同类型的幻觉表现出不同的谱特征。基于谱特征的简单检测器达到88.75%的准确率，优于基于困惑度的基线方法。

Conclusion: 谱几何能够捕捉推理模式和错误行为，为检测大语言模型中的幻觉提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

TL;DR: 通过图信号处理分析transformer架构的计算指纹，发现不同模型在语音转换任务中展现出独特的连接模式，这些光谱特征与行为差异高度相关，可作为无训练的诊断工具揭示架构偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同transformer架构如何通过不同的连接模式实现相同的语言计算，并检测这些"计算指纹"以理解模型的专业化处理策略。

Method: 使用图信号处理技术分析注意力诱导的token图，在20种语言和3个模型家族中跟踪语音转换下的代数连接性变化，特别关注早期层（2-5层）。

Result: 发现明显的架构特征：Phi-3-Mini在英语中显示显著的早期层中断，Qwen2.5-7B对形态丰富语言有分布式偏移，LLaMA-3.2-1B表现出系统性但较弱响应。光谱特征与行为差异高度相关（Phi-3: r=-0.976）。

Conclusion: 训练重点会在计算中留下可检测的印记，表现为句法转换期间可测量的连接模式。该框架可作为简单无训练的诊断工具，揭示架构偏见并支持模型可靠性分析。

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Motivation: 藏语作为亚洲主要低资源语言，具有独特的语言和社会文化特征，但在AI研究中关注有限，缺乏可访问的数据资源、标准化基准和专用工具。

Method: 系统分类现有数据集和工具，评估不同任务中使用的方法，并在可能的情况下比较性能表现。

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 本文研究大型语言模型能否通过科技公司的招聘评估，发现所有测试的LLMs都无法通过标准化招聘考试，模型答案与公司参考解决方案存在显著不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术发展，科技公司需要大量软件和算法工程师，建立了多阶段筛选流程。鉴于LLMs在编码和推理任务中的出色表现，研究其是否能够通过这些专业招聘评估。

Method: 使用最先进的LLMs对广泛使用的专业评估问卷生成回答，然后评估其表现，并与公司参考解决方案进行比较分析。

Result: 所有评估的LLMs都未能通过招聘评估，模型生成的答案与公司参考解决方案之间存在显著不一致。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在编码和推理任务中表现出色，但它们目前无法通过科技公司的标准化招聘评估，表明在专业工程能力评估方面仍存在差距。

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

TL;DR: TSSS是一个高效的多跳检索增强生成框架，通过模板化推理和基于检索器的终止器来减少令牌使用并提高推理稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的迭代提示方法在复杂推理中效率低下，会重复生成可预测的令牌序列并依赖随机停止，导致令牌使用过多和终止不稳定。

Method: 提出TSSS框架，包含：(i) 基于模板的推理，缓存重复前缀并将子查询锚定到主问题；(ii) 基于检索器的终止器，当额外子查询重复时确定性地停止推理。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHop和MuSiQue数据集上，TSSS实现了最先进的准确性和在RAG-CoT方法中具有竞争力的效率。

Conclusion: TSSS在效率受限场景（如设备端推理）中表现出色，通过分离结构化推理和终止控制实现了更快推理和更可靠答案。

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要基于结构化知识库如Wikidata评估时序知识冲突，但关注广泛覆盖的流行实体，缺乏动态结构来公平评估不同知识截止日期的LLMs。

Method: 从AWS更新、Azure变更和WHO疾病爆发报告三个真实世界时间戳语料库中识别自然发生的知识演化，生成针对不同LLM知识截止日期的问题和黄金答案。

Result: 通过对12个开源和闭源LLMs在3种知识探测格式上的广泛评估，显示在evolveQA上相比静态知识问题性能下降高达31%。

Conclusion: evolveQA基准测试能有效评估LLMs处理时序演化知识的能力，揭示了现有模型在动态知识处理方面的显著不足。

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Motivation: 开发不依赖大型语言模型检索增强生成(RAG)的问答系统，通过知识图谱检索和释义模型实现高效问答，降低计算成本。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段预处理文档生成问答对，第二阶段将问答对转换为知识图谱，使用嵌入和模糊技术进行图检索，通过查询、重排序和释义生成最终答案。

Result: 在CRAG基准测试中使用LLAMA-3.2和GPT-3.5-Turbo分别达到71.9%和54.4%的准确率，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了不依赖LLM-RAG的知识图谱问答系统的可行性，为资源受限环境下的问答任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法捕捉多轮工具增强对话中的关键错误，比如当代理误解工具结果但用户仍感到满意的情况。

Method: 引入TRACE基准（系统合成的工具增强对话）和SCOPE框架（自动发现错误模式和评估标准）。

Result: 实验表明SCOPE显著优于基线方法，特别是在用户满意度信号具有误导性的挑战性案例上。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决工具增强对话AI系统的评估挑战提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

TL;DR: DiSRouter是一种分布式自路由系统，通过LLM代理网络实现查询路由，每个代理基于自身能力判断是否回答或转发查询，相比集中式路由具有更好的灵活性、可扩展性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由系统依赖固定的集中式外部路由器，无法充分理解不同LLM的知识边界，导致性能不佳且缺乏灵活性。需要一种更有效的查询路由方法来平衡性能和成本。

Method: 提出DiSRouter分布式路由范式，采用两阶段自我意识训练流程增强LLM的自我认知能力，让每个LLM代理独立判断自身能力并决定是否回答或路由查询。

Result: 实验表明DiSRouter在各种场景下显著优于现有路由方法，能有效区分简单和困难查询，并在领域外任务上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用LLM内在的自我意识比外部评估更有效，为更模块化和高效的多智能体系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 现有语言知识库（如URIEL+）存在两个关键局限：一刀切的向量表示不适合语言数据的多样结构；缺乏将这些信号聚合为单一综合分数的原则性方法。

Method: 引入类型匹配语言距离框架，为每种距离类型提出新颖的结构感知表示：地理距离使用说话者加权分布，谱系距离使用双曲嵌入，类型学距离使用潜变量模型，并将这些信号统一为稳健的任务无关复合距离。

Result: 在跨语言迁移任务的语言选择中，所提出的表示和复合距离在广泛的NLP任务中持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言研究提供了更原则性和有效的工具包，通过结构感知表示和统一的复合距离改进了跨语言迁移的效果。

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

TL;DR: TheMCPCompany是一个用于评估工具调用代理在真实世界服务交互任务中的基准测试，包含超过18,000个工具。实验表明高级推理模型能有效发现工具，但在复杂企业环境中导航数万工具仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用代理主要依赖网络浏览器与环境交互，而MCP协议使得任务特定工具集数量激增，这些工具比通用工具更易开发维护。需要评估工具调用代理在真实服务交互中的实用性。

Method: 使用各种真实世界服务的REST API创建MCP服务器，提供超过18,000个工具，并为每个任务手动标注真实工具。通过真实工具和工具检索两种方式评估代理性能。

Result: 使用真实工具时，工具调用代理在性能和成本方面都有提升。通过工具检索，所有模型表现相似或优于基于浏览器的代理，但小模型无法充分利用可用工具。GPT-5通过工具检索的性能接近其使用真实工具的性能。

Conclusion: 最先进的推理模型在简单环境中能有效发现工具，但在复杂企业环境中导航数万工具并组合解决复杂问题仍具挑战，需要更好的推理和检索模型。

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

TL;DR: KORE是一种协同方法，通过知识导向增强和约束，向大型多模态模型注入新知识同时保留旧知识，解决知识适应和保留问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型的预训练知识是静态的，无法跟上现实世界发展，现有方法在学习新知识时容易遭受灾难性遗忘。

Method: KORE将知识项自动转换为结构化知识确保准确学习，同时将旧知识存储在协方差矩阵中，通过投影到零空间初始化适配器，最小化对旧知识的干扰。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5-7B、LLaVA-v1.5-13B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B等模型上的实验表明，KORE实现了优越的新知识注入性能并有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: KORE方法能够有效解决大型多模态模型的知识更新问题，在知识适应和保留方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个全面的幻觉分类法（11个类别）和HAD模型，将幻觉检测、跨度识别和修正集成到单一推理过程中，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言生成模型应用的增加，模型输出中存在的幻觉问题（产生看似合理但错误的信息）已成为关键挑战，需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 提出了包含11个类别的幻觉分类法，开发了HAD模型，在约90K合成数据集上训练，将幻觉检测、跨度级识别和修正集成到单一推理流程中。

Result: 在领域内和领域外测试集上的评估显示，HAD模型在HaluEval、FactCHD和FaithBench等基准测试中普遍优于现有基线，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: HAD模型展示了在多种NLG任务中的鲁棒性和多功能性，为幻觉检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超体积优化的强化学习方法（HVO），用于优化文本摘要的多目标问题，在多个数据集上超越了GRPO方法，7B模型性能接近GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本摘要需要同时优化一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性等多个目标，虽然大语言模型表现优异，但很少有研究关注基于LLM的强化学习来优化多目标摘要问题。

Method: 引入超体积优化（HVO）策略，在强化学习的奖励过程中使用超体积方法动态调整组间分数，引导模型逐步逼近帕累托前沿，生成平衡的多目标摘要。

Result: 在多个代表性摘要数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在总体得分上优于GRPO，在不同维度上表现更均衡。7B基础模型增强后性能与GPT-4相当，同时生成长度更短。

Conclusion: HVO方法有效解决了文本摘要的多目标优化问题，在保持模型规模较小的同时实现了与大型模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/ai4business-LiAuto/HVO.git

TL;DR: 将推理能力集成到语音大语言模型中用于端到端槽位填充任务，通过思维链框架分解任务步骤，创建推理数据集并应用监督微调策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受推理大语言模型发展的启发，希望将推理能力整合到语音大语言模型中，以提升槽位填充任务的性能。

Method: 使用思维链框架将槽位填充任务分解为多个推理步骤，创建推理数据集，对语音大语言模型进行监督微调，并区分常规和推理语音大语言模型。

Result: 引入推理步骤能提升性能，但主要用于数学、逻辑和编码领域的推理文本大语言模型作为基础模型可能表现较差。混合语音大语言模型（基于混合文本基础大语言模型并微调以保留直接和推理两种操作模式）比仅使用单一操作模式的模型性能更好。

Conclusion: 将推理能力集成到语音大语言模型中能有效提升槽位填充任务性能，但需要选择合适的基础模型，混合操作模式的模型优于单一模式模型。

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是将心理学中关于群体身份的见解与先进的自然语言处理技术相结合，探索将社会人口属性融入LLMs是否能解决自动仇恨言论检测中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用Google的Gemini和OpenAI的GPT-4.1-mini模型，采用两种身份提示方法：浅层身份提示和基于检索增强生成（RAG）的深度情境化身份开发，以纳入更丰富的身份档案。

Result: 分析了使用组内和组外标注者身份对模型检测性能和跨不同社会群体公平性的影响，揭示了基于身份的方法在减少偏见方面的潜力和局限性。

Conclusion: 基于身份的方法在开发更公平的仇恨言论检测系统方面具有价值，但同时也存在局限性，为构建更公平的检测系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

TL;DR: LOGICAL是一个基于微调GLiNER模型的本地部署PII移除系统，在临床笔记去标识化中表现出色，F1分数达0.980，优于其他方法，且能在标准笔记本电脑上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床笔记PII移除中计算成本高和数据隐私风险的问题，特别是在资源受限环境中。

Method: 使用1515份临床文档，定义9个PII类别，微调modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0模型，并与Azure NER、Presidio、Gemini-Pro-2.5和Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct进行比较。

Result: 微调GLiNER模型F1分数达0.980，显著优于Gemini-Pro-2.5（0.845），95%文档完全净化，在标准笔记本电脑上高效运行。

Conclusion: 微调的专业化transformer模型如GLiNER为临床笔记PII移除提供了准确、计算高效且安全的解决方案，是资源密集型LLMs的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出DnD Gesture++数据集，包含2,663个语义手势标注，通过混合专家框架整合文本、音频和手势来预测对话轮次转换，实验表明语义手势能持续提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对话中，人类使用多模态线索（如语音、手势和注视）来管理轮次转换。虽然语言和声学特征很重要，但手势为建模这些转换提供了补充线索。

Method: 扩展多参与者DnD Gesture语料库为DnD Gesture++，包含2,663个语义手势标注（图标性、隐喻性、指示性和话语性手势），使用混合专家框架整合文本、音频和手势特征进行轮次转换预测。

Result: 实验表明，加入语义引导的手势相比基线模型能获得持续的性能提升，证明手势在多模态轮次转换中的补充作用。

Conclusion: 语义手势在多模态轮次转换预测中发挥重要的补充作用，整合手势特征能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

TL;DR: M3-SLU是一个新的多模态大语言模型基准，用于评估多说话人、多轮对话的口语理解能力，特别关注说话人归属推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在语音和文本理解方面表现良好，但在自然对话中理解谁在何时说了什么（说话人归属推理）方面仍存在困难。

Method: 基于四个开放语料库构建了包含12,000多个验证实例的数据集，包含音频、转录文本和元数据，并设计了两个任务：说话人归属问答和通过话语匹配的说话人归属。

Result: 结果显示模型能够捕捉说了什么内容，但经常无法识别是谁说的，揭示了说话人感知对话理解的关键差距。

Conclusion: M3-SLU作为一个具有挑战性的基准，将推动说话人感知多模态理解的研究进展。

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: AgenticMath是一个用于生成高质量数学问答对的代理流程，通过四个阶段筛选和增强数据质量，显著提升LLM的数学推理能力，使用少量高质量数据即可超越基于大规模低质量数据的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在生成高质量数据集以改进LLM推理方面存在挑战，常常产生低质量/错误答案且信息丰富度有限。

Method: 四阶段代理流程：种子问题筛选→多代理问题重述→答案增强（使用思维链推理）→问答对评估，完全无需人工标注。

Result: 在3B-8B参数LLM上使用仅30-60K数学样本进行微调，在多个数学推理基准测试中表现优于使用400K或2.3M样本的基线模型。

Conclusion: 定向、高质量的数据生成比大规模低质量数据更能有效提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

TL;DR: LoongRL是一种数据驱动的强化学习方法，通过KeyChain技术将短多跳问答转换为高难度长上下文任务，训练模型在16K长度下获得128K长度的推理能力，显著提升长上下文多跳问答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长上下文推理中的挑战，特别是高级思维模式的探索不足和高难度强化学习数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用KeyChain合成方法，通过插入UUID链将短多跳问答转换为长上下文任务，训练模型追踪正确链、识别真实问题、检索相关事实并进行推理。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B和14B上，LoongRL将长上下文多跳问答准确率分别提升23.5%和21.1%，LoongRL-14B达到74.2分，媲美更大规模前沿模型。

Conclusion: LoongRL诱导出计划-检索-推理-复查的推理模式，能泛化到远超训练长度的任务，同时保持短上下文推理能力，并通过所有128K针在干草堆压力测试。

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

TL;DR: MoE-Prism通过将传统MoE模型中的单体专家分解为细粒度子专家，并提供在线调度引擎，实现了MoE模型的弹性服务，显著增加了操作点数量，在严格延迟预算下可提升吞吐量19.9%，在资源受限时可降低延迟10.36%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型采用top-k机制在少数单体专家间路由，导致"质量悬崖"现象，只能提供少量粗粒度操作点，无法适应多样化的服务级别目标，造成资源过度配置。

Method: 1. 离线重构引擎：使用基于元启发式的分区优化求解器将单体专家分解为细粒度子专家，保持功能局部性且无需重新训练；2. 在线调度引擎：实现QoS感知调度，包含最大化云部署吞吐量和内存受限设备延迟优化卸载等策略。

Result: 在三种不同MoE模型上的评估显示，MoE-Prism比基线提供超过4倍的稳定操作点，在严格延迟预算下吞吐量提升19.9%，在资源受限时延迟降低10.36%。

Conclusion: MoE-Prism提供了关键的"控制旋钮"，弥合了模型与系统之间的差距，实现了下一代自适应、高效且QoS感知的AI服务。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的手语翻译方法，使用目标句子的句子嵌入替代传统的手语注释，无需手动标注，在德语和美国手语数据集上表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 传统手语翻译系统依赖手语注释，但这类标注数据通常规模有限且在不同数据集中差异很大，需要一种无需手动标注的监督方法。

Method: 使用目标句子的句子嵌入作为训练时的监督信号，这种方法可以从原始文本数据中学习，无需手动注释，支持多语言应用。

Result: 在德语和美国手语数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于其他无注释方法，在没有额外预训练数据的情况下缩小了无注释与有注释系统之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语翻译提供了一种有效的无注释解决方案，在多语言场景下表现优异，推动了手语翻译技术的发展。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Shakib Yazdani,Cennet Oguz,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出使用语言无关的多模态嵌入来监督手语翻译，实现直接多语言翻译，并通过耦合增强方法解决数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译通常只使用单一语言的文本进行训练，限制了可扩展性和跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 使用在多种语言文本和语音上训练的语言无关多模态嵌入来监督SLT，并提出结合多语言目标增强和视频级扰动的耦合增强方法。

Result: 实验显示相比仅使用文本句子嵌入监督，在BLEURT指标上获得一致提升，在低资源设置下改进更大。

Conclusion: 语言无关嵌入监督结合耦合增强为传统SLT训练提供了可扩展且语义鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

*Victor Morand,Nadi Tomeh,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToMMeR是一个轻量级模型（<30万参数），通过探测早期LLM层实现实体提及检测，在13个NER基准测试中达到93%的零样本召回率，90%以上的精确度，证明了结构化实体表示存在于早期transformer层中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实体提及检测是信息提取的基础，但也是已知的性能瓶颈。研究旨在探索是否可以通过轻量级模型从早期LLM层中高效恢复实体表示。

Method: 引入ToMMeR模型，通过探测早期LLM层来检测实体提及，使用LLM作为判断器验证预测质量，并进行跨模型分析验证不同架构的收敛性。

Result: 在13个NER基准测试中实现93%的零样本召回率，90%以上精确度；跨模型分析显示不同架构（1400万-150亿参数）在提及边界上高度一致（DICE >75%）；扩展分类头后达到接近SOTA的NER性能（80-87% F1）。

Conclusion: 实体提及检测自然地从语言建模中涌现，结构化实体表示存在于早期transformer层中，可以通过最小参数高效恢复。

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

TL;DR: DFKI-MLT提交的WMT-SLT 2022手语翻译系统，从瑞士德语手语视频翻译成德语文本，使用端到端的时空特征学习架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译系统使用通用seq2seq架构，但往往无法充分利用时间特征，需要改进时空特征表示。

Method: 开发了单模型学习时空特征表示和翻译的端到端架构，直接从视频帧提取特征进行翻译。

Result: 在开发集上获得5±1 BLEU分数，但在测试集上性能大幅下降至0.11±0.06 BLEU分数。

Conclusion: 端到端架构有潜力，但存在泛化问题，测试集性能显著低于开发集。

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BLiSS 1.0是一个评估认知启发模型的基准，通过选择性容忍度测试模型是否能区分自然学习者错误与人工错误，验证不同训练目标对模型与人类语言习得模式对齐的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合性能导向基准与认知启发模型评估之间的差距，测试模型是否能识别自然学习者错误比人工错误更合理。

Method: 构建包含280万自然学习者句子的基准，提供136,867个控制三元组（修正、学习者、人工），通过选择性容忍度范式评估模型。

Result: 实验表明选择性容忍度与标准语法性是不同能力，性能按训练范式聚类，验证BLiSS能有效测量训练目标对模型与人类语言习得模式对齐的影响。

Conclusion: BLiSS是衡量不同训练目标如何影响模型与人类语言习得系统模式对齐的稳健工具。

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

TL;DR: MINED是一个评估大型多模态模型时间感知能力的基准测试，包含6个维度和11个任务，涵盖2104个时间敏感知识样本。评估显示大多数开源LMM缺乏时间理解能力，但可以通过知识编辑方法有效更新知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试设计静态，无法充分评估LMMs对时间敏感知识的理解能力，需要构建专门的时间感知评估基准。

Method: 从维基百科构建MINED基准，包含2104个时间敏感知识样本，涵盖6种知识类型，由专业标注者标注。评估15个广泛使用的LMMs，并研究通过知识编辑方法更新时间敏感知识的可行性。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro获得最高平均CEM分数63.07，大多数开源LMMs缺乏时间理解能力。LMMs在组织知识上表现最好，在体育知识上表现最弱。知识编辑方法在单次编辑场景中能有效更新LMMs的知识。

Conclusion: MINED基准揭示了LMMs在时间敏感知识理解方面的局限性，但知识编辑方法为解决这一问题提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MBR解码在语音识别和语音翻译任务中表现优于波束搜索，在大多数实验设置中取得了更高的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于MBR解码在文本生成任务中表现出色，作者期望其在语音转文本任务中同样有效，但目前语音任务仍主要使用波束搜索。

Method: 在英语和日语上使用Whisper及其衍生模型评估MBR解码在ASR和ST任务中的表现。

Result: 在大多数实验设置中，MBR解码的准确率超过了波束搜索。

Conclusion: MBR解码是离线ASR和ST任务中追求高准确率的有前途方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

TL;DR: VideoAgentTrek是一个从公开屏幕录制视频自动挖掘训练数据的可扩展管道，无需手动标注，显著提升了计算机使用代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练计算机使用代理需要大量GUI交互数据，但手动标注成本过高。利用公开的屏幕录制视频作为数据源可以解决这个问题。

Method: 开发了Video2Action逆向动力学模块，包含视频定位模型和动作内容识别器，能够从视频中提取精确的GUI动作和结构化参数。

Result: 从39,000个YouTube教程视频中自动生成了152万交互步骤，在OSWorld-Verified上任务成功率从9.3%提升到15.8%，在AgentNetBench上步骤准确率从64.1%提升到69.3%。

Conclusion: 被动互联网视频可以转化为高质量的训练数据，为计算机使用代理提供可扩展的监督学习替代方案。

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MIA和机器生成文本检测目标不同，但方法都基于语言模型的概率分布信号。两个任务独立研究可能导致忽视对方领域的重要方法和见解。

Method: 理论证明两个任务的最优度量方法相同，并通过大规模实验验证可转移性，包括7种MIA方法和5种机器文本检测器在13个领域和10个生成器上的测试。

Result: 发现跨任务性能存在强等级相关性（rho>0.6），Binoculars方法在MIA基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 两个研究社区需要加强跨任务意识和合作，并开发了统一的评估套件MINT来促进公平评估。

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

*Suchir Salhan,Richard Diehl Martinez,Zébulon Goriely,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在BabyLM预训练中序列长度的影响，发现在固定计算预算下，不同任务和架构需要不同的最优序列长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型通常使用固定长度的上下文窗口，但在BabyLM挑战中许多提交使用更短的序列长度，需要研究序列长度对BabyLM预训练的影响。

Method: 使用100M词训练数据和固定计算预算，比较125M参数的Mamba和OPT模型在不同序列长度下的表现。

Result: 虽然更长的序列通常更好，但最优长度取决于任务和架构：语法泛化任务使用较短序列即可，而形态类比推理任务需要更长上下文。

Conclusion: 在BabyLM训练中，序列长度的选择应根据具体任务和模型架构来确定，没有统一的最优长度。

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead路由框架，通过预测潜在输出来改进LLM路由决策，在多个基准测试中平均性能提升7.7%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由方法仅基于输入查询进行分类，忽略了潜在输出信息，无法捕捉隐含意图和上下文细微差别，导致复杂查询的路由决策不理想

Method: Lookahead框架通过预测模型输出的潜在表示来"预见"可能的输出，使用这些预测指导模型选择，无需完整推理。实现了基于因果和掩码语言模型的两种方法

Result: 在7个公共基准测试（指令遵循、数学推理和代码生成）上的实证评估显示，Lookahead始终优于现有路由基线

Conclusion: Lookahead通过预见潜在输出实现了更明智的路由决策，显著提升了多模型系统的效率

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at
https://github.com/huangcb01/lookahead-routing.

Conclusion: 该工作为语音模型评估提供了概念基础和实践指南，帮助选择合适的评估方法并指导评估体系的扩展。

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言基础模型在特定语言上微调时经常出现灾难性遗忘，降低在未见语言上的性能，但文献对此现象的发生条件存在碎片化结果，需要系统研究来明确触发条件。

Method: 使用机器翻译作为测试平台，在不同模型架构、数据规模和微调方法上进行受控实验，分析遗忘触发条件。

Result: 发现模型与数据规模的相对比例是遗忘的主要决定因素；模型的指令遵循能力对保留多语言知识比架构更重要；参数高效微调相比全参数微调没有明显优势；跨语言对齐可以缓解遗忘并促进对未见目标语言的正面迁移。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐是缓解多语言微调中灾难性遗忘的有效策略，同时还能促进对未见语言的正面知识迁移。

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，确保其与社会规范对齐变得至关重要。现有研究缺乏针对波斯文化背景的社会偏见资源，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过与社会科学专家合作，让250名不同人口统计学背景的个体填写问卷，开发了包含16个文化类别的PBBQ基准数据集，并对多个开源、闭源和波斯语微调模型进行基准测试。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

### [137] [Style Attack Disguise: When Fonts Become a Camouflage for Adversarial Intent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19641)
*Yangshijie Zhang,Xinda Wang,Jialin Liu,Wenqiang Wang,Zhicong Ma,Xingxing Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于风格化文本的攻击方法SAD，利用人类与NLP模型在理解风格化字体和表情符号时的感知差异来攻击各类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的发展，用户使用风格化字体和表情符号来表达个性，这些视觉上吸引人的文本对人类可读，但对NLP模型构成潜在威胁，因为模型将这些字符处理为不同的标记，造成干扰。

Method: 提出了Style Attack Disguise (SAD)攻击方法，设计了两种版本：轻量版用于查询效率，强力版用于更好的攻击性能。

Result: 在情感分类和机器翻译任务上对传统模型、LLM和商业服务进行实验，证明了SAD的强大攻击性能，并展示了其在多模态任务（文本到图像、文本到语音生成）中的潜在威胁。

Conclusion: 风格化文本在人类与模型之间存在的感知差异可被利用来构建有效的攻击，SAD方法在多种任务和模型上都表现出强大的攻击能力。

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

TL;DR: LlavaCode框架通过将代码压缩为紧凑的语义表示，减少检索上下文至几个单令牌向量，在提升代码生成质量的同时显著降低推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成在代码补全中效果显著，但引入上下文会延长序列长度导致推理变慢，这在IDE等交互场景中成为关键限制。

Method: 使用小型投影器模块将代码压缩为紧凑的语义丰富表示，使检索上下文仅需几个压缩的单令牌向量，代码LLM可解释这些表示。

Result: 压缩上下文使行补全任务的首次令牌时间减少20-38%，同时以可忽略的延迟增加显著提升代码模型的EM和ES指标。

Conclusion: LlavaCode框架通过上下文压缩在保持生成质量的同时大幅降低推理延迟，为交互式代码补全提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

<details>

Motivation: 探索开放文本中情感分析的挑战，如上下文模糊性、语言变异性和复杂情感表达解释困难，这些限制使得通用模型直接应用困难

Method: 在三种场景下比较效果：(i)微调预训练模型与使用简单提示的通用LLMs性能；(ii)不同情感提示设计在LLMs中的有效性；(iii)情感分组技术对这些模型的影响

Result: 实验测试显示微调预训练模型在情感识别中达到70%以上指标，LLMs需要结构化提示工程和情感分组来提升性能

Conclusion: 这些进展改进了情感分析、人机交互以及跨领域用户行为的理解

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

TL;DR: DiffAdapt框架通过分析推理轨迹的熵模式，为不同难度的问题选择最优推理策略，在保持准确率的同时显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理大语言模型虽然表现出色，但会产生冗长的思考轨迹，计算效率低下。研究发现模型在简单问题上存在过度思考现象，需要提升推理效率。

Method: 基于熵分析发现U形模式，提出DiffAdapt轻量框架，通过小探针分类模型隐藏状态，为不同难度问题选择固定提示、温度和最大token长度的推理策略。

Result: 在5个模型和8个基准测试中，该方法在保持或提升准确率的同时，将token使用量减少高达22.4%。

Conclusion: DiffAdapt提供了一条实现计算高效推理的实用路径，无需微调基础模型即可显著提升效率。

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在干扰环境中部署大模型时的语义理解、隐私保护和可预测延迟等共同目标的问题。

Method: 包含四个组件：SenseFusion（轻量编码器）、Edge-RAG（本地检索层）、PromptRouter（成本感知策略）和Secure Execution（安全执行路径）。

Result: 在家庭、办公室和诊所部署中，实现亚秒级端到端延迟，减少跨层令牌和带宽成本，通过仅传输离散代码和编辑元数据保护隐私。

Conclusion: 支持边缘优先设计，将语义、隐私和可预测延迟视为在干扰环境中部署大模型的同等重要目标。

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究大型语言模型是否具备动机警觉能力，即能否像人类一样考虑信息来源的动机来评估内容可信度。研究发现LLMs在受控实验中表现出类似人类的动机敏感性，但在真实广告场景中表现不佳，通过简单干预可显著提升其表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类沟通具有动机性，人们会根据信息来源的意图决定信任程度。为了让LLMs在现实世界中有效运作，它们必须能够像人类一样批判性地评估内容，考虑来源的动机和激励因素。

Method: 首先使用认知科学中的受控实验验证LLMs行为是否与理性学习模型一致，然后扩展到赞助在线广告等更自然的信息环境。最后测试简单的干预措施来增强动机显著性。

Result: LLMs在受控实验中成功表现出类似人类的动机警觉，能够有效过滤有偏见来源的信息。但在真实广告场景中，LLMs的推理与理性模型预测差距较大，部分原因是额外信息分散了注意力。通过提升意图和激励显著性的简单干预，可大幅改善LLMs与理性模型的对应关系。

Conclusion: LLMs具备对他人动机的基本敏感性，但要推广到新颖的现实世界场景，还需要对这些模型进行进一步改进。

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Motivation: 研究提示词与语言模型内部表示质量的关系，以揭示预训练嵌入如何支持上下文任务解决，理解语言模型在零样本设置下执行多样化任务的机制。

Method: 对提示词嵌入进行一系列探测实验，分析零样本分类中不同提示词模板组合的效果。

Result: 研究发现提示词会影响表示质量，但这些变化与提示词对目标任务的相关性并不一致相关。

Conclusion: 更相关的提示词不一定能产生更好的表示，挑战了现有假设，并分析了可能导致这种意外行为的因素。

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

Motivation: 解决普通公民难以理解和应用复杂法律信息的问题，尽管欧盟提供了开放的法律资源，但这些资源对非专业人士来说仍然难以探索。

Method: 构建EUDial对话数据集，并提出LexGuide框架，利用检索增强生成和分层主题组织来结构化对话进程。

Result: 结果表明，主动的结构化导航能够缩小法律信息可用性与公民理解之间的差距。

Conclusion: EUDial和LexGuide是推进主动法律对话系统的实用资源，有助于提高公民对法律信息的理解能力。

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

Motivation: 现有方法无法确保LLM按照特定文化规范生成内容，直接微调LoRA权重会引入大量参数。

Method: 提出Zhyper框架，使用因子化超网络从文本描述生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到竞争性性能，参数比最先进基线减少26倍，在文化对齐中表现出更好的泛化能力和细粒度上下文价值捕捉。

Conclusion: Zhyper提供了一个参数高效的解决方案，能够有效实现LLM的文化对齐和语义条件化。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中存在"欠思考"问题，即模型频繁切换思路而缺乏充分探索，这限制了性能和token效率。

Method: SmartSwitch框架包含感知模块和干预模块，使用现成的过程奖励模型评估思路潜力，当检测到高潜力思路被过早放弃时，回溯到切换点并插入"深化提示"来鼓励深入探索。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中，该方法显著提升了不同规模大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: SmartSwitch是一个简单有效的即插即用推理策略，能够有效解决大语言模型在长链推理中的欠思考问题。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法最小化所有token的KL散度，这与推测解码最大化token接受率的目标不一致，导致草稿模型性能不佳。

Method: AdaSPEC引入选择性token过滤，使用参考模型识别并过滤难以拟合的token，只在简单token上蒸馏草稿模型，使其与目标模型更好对齐。

Result: 在算术推理、指令跟随、编码和摘要等任务上，AdaSPEC在31M/1.4B和350M/2.7B参数配置下均优于DistillSpec，接受率最高提升15%。

Conclusion: AdaSPEC通过选择性蒸馏策略有效提高了推测解码的性能，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了token接受率。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过模型合并方法处理代码混合NLP任务，相比传统微调方法在英语-印地语和英语-西班牙语的情感分析和仇恨言论检测任务上取得显著性能提升，并展示了在跨语言对迁移中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模型合并作为代码混合NLP传统适应策略的实用替代方案，旨在更有效地利用未标记数据，提升在代码混合输入上的性能表现。

Method: 从多语言基础模型出发，进行三步操作：(1)在未标记代码混合文本上继续预训练获得适应检查点；(2)将检查点与基础模型合并；(3)在下游任务数据上进行微调。

Result: 合并模型在F1分数上比完全微调高出2-5个点，比CPT->FT高出约1-2个点；在跨语言对迁移中，合并检查点比单语英语基线表现更好（TV/TIES变体达到0.65-0.68 F1 vs 完全微调的0.61-0.63）。

Conclusion: 模型合并能更有效地利用未标记数据，代码混合知识是低资源语言对更可靠的基板，并提供了针对不同数据场景的适应方案。

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有检索模型基于用户查询与工具描述的相似性进行工具排名，但用户请求往往与工具描述语言不匹配，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolDreamer框架，使用LLM生成假设性工具描述，基于这些描述训练检索器模型，使检索器能更好地理解查询意图。

Result: 在ToolRet数据集上应用ToolDreamer，提高了稀疏和密集检索器的性能，无论是否经过训练都表现出改进。

Conclusion: 该框架将部分推理负担转移给检索器，使LLM能够有效处理大量工具而不会超出上下文窗口限制。

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Scaf-GRPO框架，通过渐进式训练和分级提示解决LLM在复杂推理任务中的"学习悬崖"问题，显著提升模型在困难数学问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法面临"学习悬崖"现象：当问题远超模型当前能力时，模型持续失败导致奖励信号为零，优势计算崩溃，学习梯度消失，阻碍进步。

Method: Scaf-GRPO框架：1) 诊断学习停滞；2) 在模型独立学习停滞时提供分级提示干预，从抽象概念到具体步骤，让模型自行构建有效解决方案。

Result: 在挑战性数学基准测试中，Scaf-GRPO将Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型在AIME24基准上的pass@1得分相对GRPO基线提升了44.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架为解锁模型解决超出其当前能力范围问题的能力提供了稳健有效的方法论，是推进LLM自主推理前沿的关键一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hubble是一套用于研究LLM记忆问题的开源大语言模型，包含标准和扰动变体，通过控制插入文本来模拟记忆风险，揭示了训练语料大小和敏感数据出现时机对记忆的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM记忆敏感数据的机制和风险，为理解记忆问题提供可控的实验环境。

Method: 开发标准模型和扰动模型，在训练过程中控制插入文本（如书籍段落、传记、测试集），分析不同参数规模、训练数据量和插入时机对记忆的影响。

Result: 发现记忆风险取决于敏感数据在训练语料中的相对频率，以及敏感数据是否持续暴露；增加训练语料规模可以稀释敏感数据，而让敏感数据在训练早期出现有助于记忆。

Conclusion: 提出了应对记忆风险的最佳实践：通过增大训练语料稀释敏感数据，以及合理安排敏感数据的出现时机；Hubble模型为记忆研究、成员推断和机器遗忘提供了理想的测试平台。

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

### [153] [Test-time Verification via Optimal Transport: Coverage, ROC, & Sub-optimality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18982)
*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Debabrota Basu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析验证式测试时缩放中生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的相互作用，将其建模为传输问题，揭示了次优性-覆盖率曲线的三个区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然带有验证的测试时缩放显示出提升大语言模型性能的潜力，但验证器的作用及其不完善性仍未得到充分探索。现有研究只捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏量化它们相互作用几何特性的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证的测试时缩放框架化为传输问题，通过分析生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的相互作用，提出并分析了顺序和批量两类采样算法。

Result: 理论分析表明次优性-覆盖率曲线存在三个区域：传输区域（次优性随覆盖率增加）、策略改进区域（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器收敛区域）和饱和区域（次优性趋于稳定）。在Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型上的实证结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个统一框架来理解验证式测试时缩放中关键因素的相互作用，揭示了不同区域的行为特征，为设计更有效的采样算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: ACTMED是一个结合贝叶斯实验设计和大型语言模型的临床诊断框架，通过自适应选择最有信息量的测试来优化诊断过程，提高准确性并减少资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习诊断方法依赖静态数据集，无法模拟临床医生在实践中的顺序性、资源感知推理过程。诊断在高压或资源有限环境中仍然复杂且容易出错，需要能够帮助医生做出及时且成本效益高的决策的框架。

Method: ACTMED将贝叶斯实验设计与大型语言模型结合，在每个步骤中选择预期能最大程度减少诊断不确定性的测试。LLMs作为灵活模拟器，生成合理的患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需结构化、任务特定的训练数据。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的评估显示，ACTMED能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源使用效率。

Conclusion: ACTMED代表了向透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统迈出的一步，能够在减少对领域特定数据依赖的情况下跨环境泛化。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PRISM方法，通过学习群体不变核函数来缓解偏好奖励模型中的捷径行为，提高奖励模型的泛化能力和下游策略模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的强化学习中，偏好奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击和泛化能力差的问题，模型会利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）来获得高奖励分数，而不是真正反映人类意图。

Method: 受核视角不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，在封闭形式的学习目标中学习具有特征映射的群体不变核函数，以缓解偏好奖励学习中的捷径行为。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法一致提高了奖励模型在不同分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个鲁棒框架，有效缓解了奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

TL;DR: MUSE基准测试揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在音乐理解方面存在严重缺陷，特别是在关系推理能力上，与人类专家存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对多模态大语言模型的音频理解评估可能掩盖了其在关系推理方面的根本弱点，需要更系统的评估工具。

Method: 开发了MUSE基准测试，包含10个任务来评估基本音乐感知技能，并评估了4个SOTA模型与200人的人类基线。

Result: SOTA模型能力差异很大，与人类专家存在持续差距。Gemini Pro在基本感知上表现良好，但Qwen和Audio Flamingo 3表现接近随机水平。思维链提示效果不稳定且往往有害。

Conclusion: MUSE基准为评估不变音乐表征和开发更鲁棒的AI系统提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医疗领域快速扩展，但其根据CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力尚不明确，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证数据，在三种提示条件下系统比较了两个代表性LLMs。

Result: 模型在不同CONSORT项目和提示类型上表现出明显差异，包括推理风格转变、明确不确定性表达和替代解释方式影响响应模式。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其识别为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，旨在通过零步思考来减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但经常因过度思考导致不必要的计算开销。模式选择和早期退出方法都旨在减轻这种计算负担。

Method: 将模式选择视为早期退出问题的变体，比较了九种基线方法，包括基于提示的方法和利用模型内部信息的方法。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限而经常失败，而利用内部信息的方法在大多数场景下表现更好但稳定性存在问题。

Conclusion: 现有仅依赖模型信息的方法在信息有限的情况下不足以有效解决模式选择问题，凸显了该任务的持续挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页智能体评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中存在的结构多样性。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一加权动作图，对动作进行规范编码，合并重复行为，并应用结构分析包括奖励传播和成功加权边统计。

Result: 在来自六个网页智能体的数千条轨迹上的评估显示，图抽象能够捕捉跨模型规律性，突出冗余和低效，识别被结果指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网页交互构建为图结构数据，WebGraphEval为网页智能体的多路径、跨智能体和效率感知评估建立了通用方法学。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在法律领域的实际表现，特别是其整合知识和推理能力，而非仅与人类表现对比。

Method: 在法律领域进行实验，将ChatGPT与基于正则表达式(Regex)的基线方法进行比较。

Result: ChatGPT无法有效整合必要知识和能力进行推理，无法提供全面解决方案，在法律文本分析任务中存在根本性局限。

Conclusion: 真正的智能仍然是人类独有的特质，至少在法律领域，人工智能缺乏全面理解和推理能力。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

Motivation: 传统先例约束推理假设先例必须一致，而广义推理模型放松了这一假设。目前已有基于传统一致推理模型的论证性解释方法，但缺乏针对广义推理框架的相应解释方法。

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，使其能够解释基于广义推理模型的推理过程。

Conclusion: 成功将DSA框架扩展到广义推理模型，填补了不一致先例推理中论证性解释方法的空白。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型智能体是否能重现人类在线行为的复杂社交动态，包括同质性、互惠性和社会验证等特征，以及什么记忆和学习机制能促成这种动态的出现。

Method: 开发了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过重复互动、相互评估和上下文学习来适应行为，使用捕捉在线参与核心驱动因素的行为奖励函数，包括社交互动、信息寻求、自我呈现、协调和情感支持。

Result: 实验表明，经过指导的LLM智能体发展出稳定的互动模式并形成涌现的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能体如何近似或偏离类人社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有的持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出持续知识适应策略，维护任务特定知识向量池，动态使用历史知识适应新任务；引入自适应知识合并机制，合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL优于最先进方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过持续知识适应和自适应知识合并，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，实现了跨任务的高效知识迁移。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个用于评估LLM智能体在多跳、端到端工具编排能力的大规模基准测试，通过构建'等价功能集'和五级课程体系来系统测试智能体从单工具编排到跨服务器规划的复杂能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往孤立评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估过于乐观。MSC-Bench旨在填补这些空白，提供更客观的评估框架。

Method: 构建基于'等价功能集'的真实基准，采用五级课程体系系统测试智能体能力，从单工具编排到复杂跨服务器规划，并测试对超出范围请求的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明刚性层次结构会阻碍性能，即使最先进的智能体在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点。基准测试能够暴露这些限制并指导开发更强大的工具使用智能体。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架，能够揭示当前智能体的局限性，并为开发更强大、高效的工具使用智能体提供指导。基准测试和资源已公开可用。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at

### [165] [NeSyPr: Neurosymbolic Proceduralization For Efficient Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19429)
*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个神经符号程序化框架，通过将符号规划转化为可组合的程序表示，使语言模型在资源受限的物理系统中实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在动态环境中的实时推理挑战，克服大规模推理引擎或符号规划器在延迟、连接性和资源限制方面的约束。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定规划，然后将这些规划转化为编码隐式产生规则的可组合程序表示，最后将这些程序无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr展示了比大规模推理模型和符号规划器更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化能够将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象为单步语言模型推理，适用于延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统部署。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

*Runpeng Xie,Quanwei Wang,Hao Hu,Zherui Zhou,Ni Mu,Xiyun Li,Yiqin Yang,Shuang Xu,Qianchuan Zhao,Bo XU*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DAIL方法解决语言指令的模糊性问题，通过分布策略和语义对齐增强任务可区分性，在结构化和视觉观察基准上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致语言条件任务中存在大量模糊性，严重降低算法性能，需要解决指令歧义问题。

Method: DAIL方法包含两个关键组件：分布策略和语义对齐模块。分布策略通过价值分布估计机制增强任务可区分性，语义对齐模块捕捉轨迹与语言指令之间的对应关系。

Result: 在结构化和视觉观察基准上的广泛实验结果表明，DAIL能有效解决指令模糊性问题，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL通过分布对齐学习成功解决了语言指令的模糊性问题，为智能代理理解自然语言和遵循人类指令提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电商基准测试，要求代理根据产品描述预测10位HS编码，实验显示现有代理性能远低于人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试忽视了深度搜索代理处理复杂规则（如法律条款、关税规则）的能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐式逻辑关系，需要填补这一评估空白。

Method: 从大规模电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，由多位人类专家标注HS编码，评估多种LLM和代理在分层规则应用上的表现。

Result: 最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%，测试时扩展也无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对现有代理构成重大挑战，需要开发更强大的规则理解和应用能力，HSCodeComp为评估此类能力提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentSense是一个基于多智能体进化系统的混合训练免费框架，将大语言模型集成到参与式城市感知中，通过迭代优化任务分配来适应动态城市条件和异质工作者偏好，同时提供自然语言解释以增强透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市感知系统在多样化城市场景中泛化能力有限，决策过程缺乏可解释性，需要开发能够适应动态环境并提供透明解释的解决方案。

Method: 结合经典规划器生成基线解决方案，然后通过多智能体进化系统迭代优化，利用大语言模型适应动态城市条件和异质工作者偏好，并生成自然语言解释。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性上表现更好，提供更合理透明的解释。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署自适应和可解释城市感知系统的重要进展，为基于网络的城市管理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

TL;DR: 开发基于图的吉他即兴演奏引擎，通过构建和弦音图并计算最优路径，为吉他学生提供和弦音即兴演奏建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 和弦音即兴演奏是爵士吉他理论的基础，但学习和练习难度大，需要工具辅助学生掌握这一重要技能。

Method: 首先生成和弦音琶音，构建加权图（节点代表和弦琶音），计算相邻和弦节点间的最优过渡音权重，寻找最短路径并重构即兴演奏线。

Result: 开发了用户友好的系统，能够处理输入输出，为吉他学生提供可练习的和弦音即兴演奏建议。

Conclusion: 该图基引擎有效支持吉他学生学习和弦音即兴演奏，通过计算最优过渡路径提供实用的练习建议。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解释的电子竞技流式胜率预测分类解决方案，通过滑动窗口控制输入数据来反映游戏变化，准确率超过90%，超越了现有解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子竞技观众和玩家数量增长，加上通信解决方案和云计算技术的发展，推动了在线游戏行业的持续发展。虽然基于AI的电子竞技分析传统上被定义为从相关数据中提取有意义模式并进行可视化以增强决策，但大多数专业胜率预测工作都集中在批处理分类方面，忽视了可视化技术。

Method: 提出了一种可解释的流式胜率预测分类解决方案，通过多个滑动窗口控制输入数据来反映相关游戏变化。

Result: 实验结果显示准确率超过90%，超越了文献中竞争解决方案的性能。

Conclusion: 该系统可被排名和推荐系统利用进行明智决策，得益于可解释性模块，这增强了对结果预测的信任。

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE是一个将大语言模型与概率建模相结合的统一框架，用于学习加权规则集，通过四个阶段实现更可靠的神经符号推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法忽视了规则间的相互作用，且未充分利用LLM与概率规则学习结合进行鲁棒推理的机会。

Method: RLIE包含四个阶段：规则生成（LLM提出并过滤候选规则）、逻辑回归（学习概率权重）、迭代优化（基于预测误差更新规则集）、评估（比较不同推理策略）。

Result: 直接使用学习到的权重应用规则性能更优，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出注入LLM提示反而降低准确性。

Conclusion: LLM擅长语义生成和解释，但在精确概率集成方面可靠性较低，RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，并与经典概率规则组合方法结合实现更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一种基于transformer的架构和训练方法，用于记忆密集型、长视野任务的强化学习。它通过在训练时在模型输入中插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，在网格世界和室内导航任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的具身智能体策略训练中，视觉输入常常超出transformer的上下文限制，而人类能够维护和利用压缩为记忆的终身经验。需要开发能够形成和访问记忆的模型，使智能体在长时间内保持环境上下文。

Method: 提出Memo架构，在训练时在模型输入中交错插入周期性总结标记，实现记忆的创建和检索。该方法结合了transformer的优势，同时解决了长上下文限制问题。

Result: 在网格世界元强化学习基准和逼真室内环境的多目标导航任务中，Memo优于朴素的长上下文transformer基线，同时计算和存储效率更高。Memo在推理时对更长上下文具有更好的泛化能力，在流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memo通过记忆创建和检索机制，有效解决了transformer在长视野任务中的上下文限制问题，为具身智能体在长时间范围内的有效操作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准受限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力。

Method: 将主动性分解为三个能力管道，并应用于评估领先的LLM和智能体框架。

Result: 即使最先进的模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统在自主行动方面的当前局限性，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

Motivation: 当前学习世界模型的方法偏离了目标：训练和评估都锚定在下一帧预测上，成功标准是在相同环境中最大化奖励。需要一种更全面的评估协议。

Method: 提出了WorldTest协议，包含无奖励探索、衍生测试和行为评分。实例化为AutumnBench，包含43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务，涵盖掩码帧预测、规划和因果动态变化预测。

Result: 比较了517名人类参与者和三个前沿模型，发现人类表现优于模型，计算规模扩大只在某些环境中提高性能。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了一个新颖的模板来评估智能体对环境动态的学习，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习的显著提升空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

Abstract: In the present study, Taylor bubble formation in two-phase gas-non-Newtonian
Carreau liquid flowing through a confined co-flow microchannel is investigated.
Systematic analysis are carried out to explore the influences of rheological
properties, inlet velocities, and surface tension on Taylor bubble length,
shape, velocity and liquid film thickness. Aqueous solutions of carboxymethyl
cellulose (CMC) with different mass concentrations are considered as the
non-Newtonian liquids to understand the fundamentals of flow behaviour. With
increasing solution viscosity and liquid phase inlet velocity, Taylor bubble
formation frequency and velocity increased, however, the bubble length was
found to decrease. Velocity profiles inside the Taylor bubble and liquid slug
were analyzed, and distinct velocity distributions were found for different CMC
concentrations. Flow pattern maps are constructed based on inlet velocities for
Carreau liquids in co-flow microchannel. This study essentially provides useful
guidelines in designing non-Newtonian microfluidic system for precise control
and manipulation of Taylor bubbles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程设备的几何设计和优化过程缓慢且缺乏系统性，工程师通常只能对标准形状进行小幅调整，通过原型制作来寻求改进，效率低下。

Method: 开发了紧凑的可编程几何模型，能够复现所有标准叶轮形状，并结合功率控制CFD和进化搜索算法，在23参数的叶轮-挡板空间中进行3000次模拟循环。

Result: 发现了多个优于Rushton/4挡板基准的设计家族，包括扭曲板叶轮和倾斜/弯曲挡板，混合强度提升18-78%，均匀性CoV降低16-64%，并建立了清晰的强度-均匀性帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: HARPPP将模拟器作为目标函数，可推广到任何具有可信物理模型的其他设备设计中，实现了工业设备几何优化的自动化和系统化。

Abstract: Designing and optimising the geometry of industrial process equipment remains
slow and still largely ad hoc: engineers make small tweaks to one standard
shape at a time, build prototypes, and hope for gains. We introduce HARPPP, an
autonomous design loop that couples a compact, programmable geometry model to
power-controlled CFD and evolutionary search. The geometry model is a single
mathematical description that reproduces every standard impeller as a special
case while spanning an unlimited set of manufacturable shapes. Working with
Johnson Matthey on an industrial vessel, HARPPP explored a 23-parameter
impeller-baffle space at constant power (3024 W), executing 3,000 simulation
cycles in 15 days. The search uncovered multiple design families that
outperform a Rushton/4-baffle baseline in both mixing intensity and uniformity,
including twisted-plate impellers and pitched/curved baffles (intensity +18 to
+78 percent; uniformity CoV -16 to -64 percent). A clear intensity-uniformity
Pareto frontier emerged, enabling application-specific choices. Because HARPPP
treats the simulator as the objective, it generalises to other equipment
wherever credible physics models exist.

Abstract: The present research is a theoretical study about the transient friction
created in circular pipe mean flow, whenever an incompressible Newtonian fluid
is accelerated through a monotonously-increased mean-pressure gradient. The
resulting friction stress is the sum of two components, one laminar and the
other purely turbulent, not synchronised between them. Each component is
analysed separately, in a series of theoretical experiments that explore
various possibilities, depending on the degree of asynchrony between them. It
is found that in some cases the transient friction is higher than in equal-Re
steady-sate flow, but in some others it is noticeably lower. This work provides
an analytical explanation for most of the important and interesting phenomena
reported in the literature. To do so, it takes advantage of the Theory of
Underlying Laminar Flow (TULF), already introduced in previous works of same
authors. The TULF predicts quite approximately what is observed in experiments,
including the transient skin-friction coefficient and the presence of
mean-velocity overshoots. Additionally, the role of the time constant in
turbulent mean flow is examined and related to the turbulence's frozen time.
Finally, a study of the logarithmic layer evolution in the transient flow is
accomplished, which results destroyed during the increase of turbulence
occurring along the transient. In summary, the present work unveils new
knowledge about transient friction in unsteady flows.

Abstract: A numerical investigation of flat fan sprays is conducted via Direct
Numerical Simulations (DNS). Diverging liquid sheets are generated using
tailored initial velocity profiles, where the opening angle serves as an
explicit control parameter. The analysis reveals two distinct regimes: at low
Weber numbers, the sheet features thick, retracting rims moving at the
Taylor-Culick velocity, though rim-driven break-up is not observed without
advanced techniques like Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), At high Weber numbers,
aerodynamic instabilities govern disintegration, with hole break-up absent in
all cases. Representing the spray as a triangular sheet, a simplified model is
proposed to predict the axial thickness evolution, showing good agreement with
numerical measurements. The study also quantifies the influence of Weber number
and opening angle on surface wave properties. An existing break-up length model
is successfully applied, incorporating the present initial conditions, offering
a predictive tool for future numerical and experimental studies.

Abstract: Laboratory experiments with rotating tanks remain the premier physical
analogue for atmospheric dynamics. Often, the equipment involved is engineered
to be sufficiently versatile and modular so as to be able to accommodate
experiments that explore a wide range of atmospheric processes. The exercise of
initially configuring the apparatus then involves running experiments that
sweep through parameter space to identify the specific dynamical regimes of
interest. This process is typically considered part of the development and
testing phase of a given project, and these initial experiments are generally
left unreported; while many of these test experiments may not be directly
relevant to the project at hand, they may be useful for other applications or
scientific communities. Here we report on a series of 93 different laboratory
experiments run with the intention of identifying suitable experimental
configurations that excite and sustain standing Rossby waves.

TL;DR: 通过24个理想化实验室实验研究极地放大效应对中纬度动力学的影响，发现极地放大将导致中纬度天气从瞬态风暴转向更持久的事件，但这些持久事件的纬向波长和南北范围会减小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极地放大效应会减少纬度表面温度梯度，但对中纬度动力学的具体影响尚不清楚，需要通过可控实验来独立研究温度梯度、背景纬向流速度和位涡梯度的影响。

Method: 使用能够独立控制纬度温度梯度(ΔT)、背景纬向流速度(Ub)和位涡梯度(β)的理想化实验室装置，进行24个不同的实验，分析这些参数对罗斯贝波和变率分配的影响。

Result: 减小侧壁温差显著减少小尺度高频动力学但不影响大尺度流场特征；减小纬向流速度会减小驻罗斯贝波的长度尺度和振幅；减小位涡梯度则有相反效果；变率分配响应取决于所有三个实验参数。

Conclusion: 极地放大的动力学后果是中纬度天气倾向于从瞬态风暴转向更持久的事件，但这些持久事件的纬向波长和南北范围会减小，可用无量纲项Ubβ/N²来描述变率行为。

Abstract: Polar amplification describes the predicted reduction in the latitudinal
surface temperature gradient, which will have physical implications for
mid-latitude dynamics. The precise nature of these dynamical consequences
remains unclear. Here we explore aspects of polar amplification by way of 24
distinct idealised laboratory experiments. The apparatus employed can
independently prescribe laboratory analogues for the latitudinal temperature
gradient ($\Delta{T}$, which controls the stratification $N$), background zonal
flow speed ($U_{b}$), and strength of the background gradient in potential
vorticity ($\beta$). The ability to control these processes individually is
beneficial as decoupling them from one another enables their influences can be
examined separately. Reducing the sidewall temperature difference substantially
reduces small-scale and high frequency dynamics, but does not affect the large
scale features of the flow, including the north-south amplitude of standing
meanders. Reducing the zonal flow speed does reduces the length-scales and
amplitudes of the standing Rossby waves, while reducing the potential vorticity
gradient has the opposite effect; these responses are well described by the
canonical expression relating the standing Rossby wavelength to
$\sqrt{U_{b}/\beta}$. Variability is partitioned into components that are
standing and transient; the response of this variability partitioning depends
on all 3 experimental parameters, and a non-dimensional term is developed
($U_{b}\beta/N^{2}$) which captures the behaviour of the variability. These
findings suggest that the dynamical consequences of polar amplification is a
tendency for mid-latitude weather to shift away from transient storms towards
more persistent events, however the zonal wavelength and north-south extent of
these persistent events will tend to decrease.

Abstract: Vertical forcing of partially filled horizontal cylindrical tanks can induce
strong sloshing motion, disrupting thermal stratification between the subcooled
liquid and the superheated vapor, and causing significant pressure variations.
While this configuration is critical for cryogenic fuel storage in future
aircraft and ground transport, its thermodynamic consequences remain poorly
characterized. This work presents an experimental investigation of
sloshing-induced heat and mass transfer in a horizontally oriented cylinder
under vertical harmonic excitation. Using a hydrofluoroether fluid (3M Novec
HFE-7000), decoupled isothermal and non-isothermal campaigns are conducted to
characterize the kinematic and thermodynamic responses across various fill
levels and forcing amplitudes, near resonance of the first longitudinal
symmetric mode $(2,0)$. To quantify the underlying heat and mass transfer
processes, a lumped-parameter model is coupled with an Augmented-state Extended
Kalman Filter (AEKF) to infer time-resolved Nusselt numbers from the
experimental data. The results confirm the existence of a critical forcing
threshold, below which the fluid remains quiescent and thermally stratified.
Above this threshold, parametric resonance triggers strong liquid motion,
leading to complete thermal destratification and a rapid pressure drop. At a
50% fill level, the primary jet-like modal response intermittently alternates
with a planar $(1,0)$ mode, indicating subharmonic resonance from non-linear
mode interactions. The AEKF-based inference reveals that the onset of thermal
destratification causes a step-change increase in interfacial and wall Nusselt
numbers by several orders of magnitude. Pressure-rate decomposition shows that
the pressure evolution is dominated by phase change.

Conclusion: MHD方程中存在与剪切流湍流中RSS相对应的结构，这种结构由不稳定性产生，可形成大尺度相干发电机，并可能维持自持续的湍流状态。

Abstract: The roll streak structure (RSS) is ubiquitous in shear flow turbulence and is
fundamental to the dynamics of the self-sustaining process (SSP) maintaining
the turbulent state. The formation and maintenance of the RSS in wall-bounded
shear flow suggest the presence of an underlying instability that has recently
been identified using statistical state dynamics (SSD). Due to the parallelism
between the Navier-Stokes equation and the induction equation, it is reasonable
to inquire whether the RSS in wall-bounded shear flow has a counterpart in the
MHD equations formulated as an SSD. In this work we show that this is the case
and that an analytic solution for the composite velocitymagnetic field RSS in
the MHD SSD also arises from an instability, that this instability equilibrates
to either a fixed point or to a turbulent state, that these turbulent
statistical equilibria may be self sustaining, and that both the fixed point
and the turbulent states may correspond to large scale coherent dynamos.

Motivation: 多孔介质的大表面积特性使其在胶体和界面科学中成为极端案例，但传统的达西定律扩展仅能严格描述毛细管主导流态中的连通路径流动，无法充分描述其他具有移动界面和拓扑变化的流态。缺乏适当描述使得从孔隙尺度到达西尺度的多相流动升尺度成为长期挑战。

Result: 论文综述了多种新概念，这些概念能够更好地描述多孔介质中多相流动的复杂时空动态，包括移动界面和拓扑变化等传统方法无法充分处理的流态。

Conclusion: 基于实验观察和先进成像技术的新概念为多孔介质中多相流动的描述提供了更全面的框架，解决了传统达西定律扩展的局限性，推动了该领域在热力学、统计力学和积分几何学方面的发展。

Abstract: An outstanding characteristic of porous media, desired in many applications,
is the large surface area, which facilitates solid-fluid interactions, making
porous media an extreme case in colloid and interface science. In two-fluid
systems, wetting and the balance of capillary and viscous forces control fluid
displacement processes, leading to a wide range of complex flow regimes with
rich spatio-temporal dynamics. Macroscopic two-phase flow is historically
described through the phenomenological extensions of Darcy's law. Besides many
other shortcomings and inconsistencies, it covers only connected pathway flow
in the capillary-dominated flow regime in a rigorous manner while other flow
regimes with moving interfaces and associated topological changes are entirely
implicit. Given the lack of adequate descriptions, upscaling multiphase flow
from pore to Darcy scale represents a long-standing challenge paving into the
fields of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and integral geometry. In this
review, we compare novel concepts which have been largely motivated by
experimental insights, enabled by significant advances in pore-scale imaging
and modeling over the last decade.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可调权重函数的广义Gauss-Jacobi求积法(GGJQ)，用于离散速度方法(DVM)，能够准确捕捉从近平衡到高度稀薄的各种流态，计算效率优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无限域求积法(如Gauss-Hermite)在强非平衡条件下失效，而有限区间求积法(如Newton-Cotes)在近平衡时效率低下，需要一种能同时处理平衡和非平衡状态的求积方法。

Method: 构建基于可调权重函数的广义Gauss-Jacobi求积框架，将速度空间映射到极坐标或球坐标，实现灵活自适应的离散化。

Result: GGJQ在广泛的Knudsen数范围内始终优于传统的Newton-Cotes和Gauss-Hermite方案，在不牺牲精度的情况下实现了更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: GGJQ为多尺度动力学模拟提供了一种稳健高效的求积策略，能够准确捕捉从近平衡到高度稀薄的各种流态。

Abstract: The discrete velocity method (DVM) is a powerful framework for simulating gas
flows across continuum to rarefied regimes, yet its efficiency remains limited
by existing quadrature rules. Conventional infinite-domain quadratures, such as
Gauss-Hermite, distribute velocity nodes globally and perform well near
equilibrium but fail under strong nonequilibrium conditions. In contrast,
finite-interval quadratures, such as Newton-Cotes, enable local refinement but
lose efficiency near equilibrium. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
generalized Gauss-Jacobi quadrature (GGJQ) for DVM, built upon a new class of
adjustable weight functions. This framework systematically constructs one- to
three-dimensional quadratures and maps the velocity space into polar or
spherical coordinates, enabling flexible and adaptive discretization. The GGJQ
accurately captures both near-equilibrium and highly rarefied regimes, as well
as low- and high-Mach flows, achieving superior computational efficiency
without compromising accuracy. Numerical experiments over a broad range of
Knudsen numbers confirm that GGJQ consistently outperforms traditional
Newton-Cotes and Gauss-Hermite schemes, offering a robust and efficient
quadrature strategy for multiscale kinetic simulations.

Motivation: 研究手性活性流体（由自旋粒子组成）的流体动力学，这类流体由于微观尺度上的能量注入而产生旋转，其粘度张量中存在反对称贡献（奇粘度）。

Method: 推广亥姆霍兹最小耗散定理到奇粘度系统，考虑具有剪切粘度和奇粘度的模型流体，计算点力密度作用下的应力张量，并通过奇点表示法求解平移和旋转球形粒子周围的精确压力场和流场。

Result: 证明了奇粘度影响下的流场耗散更多能量，平移球体在奇粘度存在时耗散增加，而旋转球体则不受影响。

Conclusion: 奇粘度改变了流体的能量耗散特性，对平移运动有显著影响，但对纯旋转运动无影响，这为理解手性活性流体的独特行为提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Chiral active fluids consist of self-spinning particles that rotate as a
result of a continuous injection of energy on the microscopic scale (e.g., by
activity or an external field). The hydrodynamics of such fluids is described
by antisymmetric contributions in the viscosity tensor -called odd viscosity-,
which are allowed by symmetry due to the presence of a non-trivial spin angular
momentum density. By generalising the Helmholtz minimum dissipation theorem to
systems with odd viscosity, we show that incompressible three-dimensional odd
fluids in the presence of sources that induce flow (e.g. surfaces that impose
boundary conditions) admit a unique solution for their steady flow fields at
low Reynolds number. Furthermore, we prove that such flows dissipate more
energy than ordinary Stokes flow, provided that the flow field is affected by
odd viscosity. As an example, we consider a model fluid described by one shear
viscosity and one odd viscosity in the creeping flow regime. We explicitly
compute the stress tensor when such a fluid is subjected to a point force
density. Finally, we compute exact results for the pressure and flow fields
around a translating and rotating spherical particle from their singularity
representations. From these solutions and our extended Helmholtz theorem, we
explain why a translating sphere dissipates more energy when odd viscosity is
present, whereas a rotating sphere does not.

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

Result: 在上下文赌博机中锚定改进WinMass 38-63%，KDE平滑在重尾噪声下达到0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）；在顺序强化学习中锚定改进噪声偏好性能15-29%

Conclusion: 对于干净或中等噪声使用成对锚定Soft-DPO，对于极端污染使用基于KDE的列表ADPO

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了噪声鲁棒的Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)框架，通过显式建模奖励噪声为伯努利噪声，在估计奖励翻转概率后应用噪声校正来去偏学习信号，提供可证明无偏的梯度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的强化学习(RLHF)或可验证奖励(RLVR)对不一致或错误奖励的噪声高度敏感，但此类噪声与广泛使用的基于群体的策略优化方法之间的相互作用研究不足。

Method: 引入GRPO和Dr.GRPO框架，将奖励腐败建模为伯努利噪声，在估计奖励翻转概率后应用噪声校正来去偏学习信号，获得可证明无偏的梯度估计。

Result: 在数学和代码任务中应用噪声校正到标准奖励模型使用时观察到一致的改进，在数学任务中准确率最高提升6.7个百分点，在代码任务中提升1.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 这项工作将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF连接起来，为噪声现实世界部署提供了理论见解和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了三种多尺度学习方法：基于分区统一方法的神经网络分解、奇异值分解提取主导模式、以及稀疏高阶SVD从有限测量重建多尺度动力学，有效捕捉复杂多尺度系统的宏观和微观行为。

Motivation: 解决复杂多尺度系统建模和预测的挑战，包括固有的非线性、初始条件敏感性，以及传统机器学习方法无法捕捉高频行为的问题。

Method: 1. 分区统一方法结合神经网络分解动力学为局部组件；2. 奇异值分解提取主导模式分离宏观和微观尺度动力学；3. 稀疏高阶SVD从有限测量重建多尺度动力学。

Result: 这些方法能够准确捕捉粗粒度和精细尺度动力学，适用于涉及复杂多尺度现象的实际应用，并能适应具有不完整观测的高维系统。

Conclusion: 提出的多尺度学习框架有效解决了复杂多尺度系统的建模挑战，在所有时间尺度上提供近似和解释，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

TL;DR: 本文提出BAPO方法，通过动态调整裁剪边界来解决离线强化学习中策略熵下降、优化不稳定和崩溃的问题，在多个基准测试中取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在语言模型对齐中面临策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃的挑战，主要原因是负优势样本主导策略梯度以及固定裁剪机制阻止熵增加更新。

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则动态调整裁剪边界，自适应地重新平衡正负贡献，保持熵并稳定RL优化。

Result: 在AIME 2024和2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越开源对手，32B BAPO模型在同规模模型中达到最先进水平，甚至优于o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO通过自适应裁剪机制有效解决了离线强化学习的稳定性问题，实现了快速、稳定且数据高效的训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [196] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出许多深度神经网络的后验泛化度量是脆弱的——微小的训练修改会显著改变度量的值、趋势或缩放行为，即使这些修改几乎不影响底层DNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度神经网络的各种泛化度量难以获得紧致边界，但通常认为它们能重现定性泛化趋势。本文旨在揭示这些后验泛化度量的脆弱性。

Method: 通过实验展示微小超参数调整（如学习率调整或SGD变体切换）如何逆转学习曲线斜率，并识别更微妙形式的脆弱性，如PAC-Bayes原点度量无法捕捉数据复杂性差异。

Result: 发现路径范数、谱范数和Frobenius范数、平坦度代理以及确定性PAC-Bayes替代等许多边界都是脆弱的，而基于函数的边际似然PAC-Bayes边界能捕捉数据复杂性差异。

Conclusion: 新度量开发者应明确审计其度量的脆弱性，因为许多后验泛化度量在训练微小变化下表现不稳定。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并引入旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，而选择性原位适应方法能实现精确适应但内存消耗大。需要平衡这种权衡。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数（连接），然后为这些选定的参数引入旁路连接。在微调过程中，只更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实验表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%的可训练参数就能达到最先进的性能，同时将CUDA内存使用量减少高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功解决了参数高效微调中的权衡问题，在保持高内存效率的同时实现了细粒度模型适应，为大规模模型微调提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Motivation: 传统非线性PDE求解器计算成本高，神经算子虽然推理速度快但分布外泛化能力差，需要解决这一关键问题。

Method: 使用可微分谱求解器进行监督，结合PGD风格主动采样在平滑性和能量约束下搜索最坏情况输入来扩展训练集。

Result: 在Burgers和Navier-Stokes系统上的实验表明，对抗蒸馏显著提高了分布外鲁棒性，同时保持了神经算子的低参数成本和快速推理优势。

Conclusion: 对抗蒸馏框架有效解决了神经算子的分布外泛化问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Motivation: 自编码器在无监督时间序列异常检测中应用广泛，但其学习到的表示对训练时间序列中的异常敏感，导致准确性降低。需要提高在污染训练数据下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的编码-分解范式和基于互信息的异常检测方法有效提升了在污染训练数据下的检测性能，具有较好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，需要深层复杂结构来捕捉非线性特征效应，这削弱了模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出SGT框架，每个内部节点对单个特征应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数；开发ShapeCART算法来学习SGT；扩展至双变量形状函数（S²GT）和多路树（SGT_K）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统轴对齐线性树实现了更优的性能和更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: SGT通过引入可学习的形状函数，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了决策树的表达能力，是传统决策树的有效改进。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习后门攻击方法依赖基于规则的关键层选择，未考虑层间相互关系，导致攻击效果不佳且容易被高级防御检测到。

Method: 提出POLAR框架，采用轻量级伯努利采样的强化学习方法，通过策略梯度更新基于后门成功率优化层选择，并引入正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: 实验表明POLAR在对抗6种最先进防御方法时，比最新攻击方法效果提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在联邦学习后门攻击中的有效性，能够动态学习攻击策略并实现高成功率和隐蔽性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模实证研究发现，Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) 的学习率缩放规则仅在训练初期有效，而在实际LLM训练中，权重衰减才是维持内部表示更新动态稳定的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究muP学习率缩放规则在实际神经网络训练中的有效性，特别是在大规模语言模型训练场景下，探索学习率跨模型尺寸迁移的机制。

Method: 进行大规模实证调查，分析muP假设在实际训练过程中的成立情况，比较muP与权重衰减在稳定内部表示更新动态方面的作用。

Result: 发现muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，在后续训练中权重衰减才是稳定更新动态的关键；muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用，可被改进的预热计划替代。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了关于学习率迁移的普遍认知，解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体才能成功实现迁移。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程学习已成为提升大型语言模型推理能力的流行策略，但先前研究使用不同的难度指标和训练设置，留下了基本问题：课程学习何时有效？前向还是反向课程更好？答案是否取决于测量指标？

Method: 采用统一的离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个维度：问题难度、模型惊奇度、置信度边际、预测不确定性和决策变异性。在数学推理基准上对Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B和Gemma3-4B进行受控的后训练实验。

Result: 研究发现：(i) 没有通用的课程策略 - 前向与反向课程学习的相对效果共同取决于模型能力和任务复杂度；(ii) 即使在单一指标内，不同难度级别的样本根据任务需求产生不同的增益；(iii) 任务对齐的课程侧重于塑造模型的最终表示和泛化，而内部状态课程调节内部状态如置信度和不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了通用课程策略的概念，为不同模型和任务机制提供了可操作的指导，某些指标表明优先处理决策不确定样本可以进一步改善学习结果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing

*Matthew Raffel,Adwaith Renjith,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster框架通过元学习器和聚类技术，将KANs的参数压缩80倍而不损失精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用向量权重替代标量权重，提高了表达能力但导致参数和内存的倍增，需要压缩方法

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，通过K-means聚类用共享质心替代每个边的向量，最后微调质心码本

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，MetaCluster实现了参数存储减少高达80倍，且无精度损失

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功解决了KANs参数膨胀问题，通过向量参数特性实现高效压缩

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

*Ahmed Sayeed Faruk,Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在上下文线性赌博机框架下学习同伴影响力概率的问题，揭示了遗憾最小化与估计误差之间的基本权衡，并提出了一种通过调整参数实现该权衡范围内任意配对的不确定性引导探索算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在社交网络中，用户推荐的成功率高度依赖于上下文因素，准确估计这些影响力概率对于理解信息传播过程和改进病毒式营销策略至关重要。然而，从数据中学习这些概率具有挑战性：静态数据只能捕捉相关性而非因果关系，而在线学习算法要么浪费资源进行随机探索，要么偏向探索高影响力概率的空间。

Method: 采用上下文线性赌博机框架，提出了一种不确定性引导探索算法，通过调整参数来平衡遗憾最小化与估计误差之间的权衡。

Result: 在合成网络数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于静态方法和忽略这种权衡的上下文赌博机方法。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了学习同伴影响力概率时遗憾最小化与估计误差之间的基本权衡关系，并提出了能够灵活调整权衡策略的有效算法，为社交网络中的影响力建模和营销策略优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

*Daniel Zhao,Daniel Beaglehole,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Julian McAuley,Zachary Novack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MusicRFM是一个基于递归特征机器(RFMs)的框架，能够在无需重新训练的情况下对预训练音乐模型进行细粒度、可解释的控制，通过直接引导模型内部激活来实现对音符、和弦等音乐属性的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可控音乐生成方法通常需要重新训练模型或会产生可听伪影，因此需要一个能够在不影响生成质量的前提下对冻结预训练模型进行细粒度控制的方法。

Method: 首先训练轻量级RFM探针来发现MusicGen隐藏状态中的'概念方向'(对应音乐属性的激活空间轴)，然后在推理过程中将这些方向注入回模型，通过动态时间变化调度和多属性同时执行机制来实时引导生成过程。

Result: 该方法成功平衡了控制与生成质量之间的权衡：将目标音符生成的准确率从0.23提高到0.82，同时文本提示的依从性保持在未引导基线的约0.02范围内。

Conclusion: MusicRFM展示了RFMs在音乐领域的应用潜力，能够在不显著影响提示保真度的情况下实现有效控制，为可控音乐生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了InvarGC方法，利用跨环境异质性来缓解潜在混杂因素的影响，并在边缘级别粒度上区分干预和非干预环境，从而恢复不变的因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Granger因果关系测试基于线性模型，难以检测非线性因果关系，且现有方法依赖因果充分性和已知干预目标这两个关键假设。现实中时间序列数据通常来自异质环境，缺乏干预的先验知识，且存在潜在混杂因素会引入虚假相关性。

Method: 提出InvarGC方法，利用跨环境异质性来缓解潜在混杂因素的影响，并在边缘级别粒度上区分干预和非干预环境，从而恢复不变的因果关系。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争性性能。

Conclusion: InvarGC方法能够有效解决传统Granger因果关系测试的局限性，在存在潜在混杂因素和未知干预的情况下恢复不变的因果关系。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了潜意识腐败现象，即不良特性通过语义中立数据传播，绕过标准安全检查。通过GPT-2的师生设置实验，发现这种行为会导致行为交叉、在临界阈值发生急剧相变，且腐败机制难以检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型越来越多地在合成数据上进行微调，存在微妙错位通过互连AI系统传播的关键风险。虽然这种现象已被识别，但对其动态的定量理解仍然缺失。

Method: 使用GPT-2构建师生设置，系统研究潜意识腐败的缩放规律、阈值和机制，包括行为分析、临界阈值识别和可解释性分析。

Result: 实验揭示三个关键发现：1）潜意识腐败导致行为交叉，降低模型整体对齐性；2）对齐性在污染数据临界阈值处发生急剧相变；3）腐败机制模仿自然微调过程，难以检测。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了依赖合成数据的AI系统中存在关键漏洞，并强调需要能够考虑潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

TL;DR: 提出了两种在特征空间进行微调的方法LoRFA和VeFA，通过轻量级特征变换补偿下游潜伏变量的影响，在保持预训练知识的同时提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型微调中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当下游领域数据有限或与预训练分布差异较大时。现有参数高效微调方法在权重空间操作，可能导致模型过度专门化，覆盖预训练知识。

Method: 在特征空间进行微调，提出LoRFA（低秩特征适应）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适应）。基于效应等价建模理论，通过轻量级特征级变换补偿下游潜伏变量的影响。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上评估，特征空间适应方法在标准微调指标上取得可比结果，并在鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 特征空间适应能有效保持预训练表示，提高模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，相比权重空间方法具有更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对线性部分监测问题提出了一种基于探索优化的简单算法，在非随机对抗环境下实现了高效的遗憾界限，该界限透明地依赖于游戏结构，在易游戏中达到√T速率，在难游戏中达到T^{2/3}速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性部分监测能够建模无限结果空间，同时在线性结构和观测上施加约束，这是对线性bandits的推广，其中损失和反馈以灵活方式解耦。本文旨在解决该问题的非随机对抗版本。

Method: 采用探索优化方法的简单实例，该实例易于高效实现，推导出更透明依赖游戏结构的遗憾界限。

Result: 得到的遗憾界限包含反映观测与损失对齐程度的实例特定量，在易游戏（局部可观测）中达到标准√T速率，在难游戏（全局可观测）中达到T^{2/3}速率。

Conclusion: 该界限在一系列新旧部分信息设置中实例化，并证明在有趣情况下对游戏结构的依赖可能是紧的。

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Result: 每种方法都能提高分类性能，组合使用时在所有行为类别（包括罕见的冻结和逃跑行为）上都获得了强F1分数。

Conclusion: 该模型支持跨学科研究者通过整合不同时间点和环境中的行为特征，构建能够解决复杂研究问题的综合数据集。

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

*Fangyuan Sun,Ilyas Fatkhullin,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对随机自然梯度变分推断(NGVI)的理论基础进行了深入研究，特别是在非共轭似然情况下。作者提出了确保变分损失满足相对平滑性的充分条件，设计了改进的NGVI算法并证明了其全局收敛性，在某些结构假设下还发现了变分损失的隐藏凸性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NGVI在变分推断中应用广泛且经验成功，但其理论基础仍然有限，特别是在非共轭似然情况下。现有收敛保证仅适用于共轭模型，无法扩展到非共轭设置，其中变分损失变得非凸且难以分析。

Method: 作者关注均值场参数化，首先推导了变分损失相对于合适镜像映射满足相对平滑性的充分条件；然后利用这种结构提出了包含非欧几里得投影的改进NGVI算法；最后在额外结构假设下探索了变分损失的隐藏凸性。

Result: 证明了改进NGVI算法的全局非渐近收敛到驻点；在特定结构假设下建立了NGVI到全局最优解的快速全局收敛；为NGVI在挑战性推断设置中的几何和收敛行为提供了新的理论见解。

Conclusion: 这项工作显著推进了对NGVI的理论理解，特别是在非共轭设置下，为变分推断方法在更广泛场景中的应用提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

TL;DR: 多任务后训练中，不同任务产生的梯度大小存在显著差异，导致优化偏向大梯度任务，但这种梯度差异与学习收益不成正比，需要梯度级别的修正方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务后训练通常假设所有任务贡献相似大小的梯度，但研究发现这个假设在RL后训练中不成立，某些任务会产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏差。

Method: 通过分析不同任务在RL后训练中产生的梯度大小和学习收益之间的关系，研究梯度不平衡现象。

Result: 发现大梯度任务并不一定带来更大的学习收益，梯度不平衡不能通过训练奖励或优势等典型统计量解释，而是源于任务本身的固有差异。

Conclusion: 需要避免简单的数据集混合，未来应开发基于梯度级别的修正方法来处理多任务后训练中的梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Result: 在马尔可夫采样下建立了有限时间收敛分析，样本复杂度为O(ε^-3)，通信复杂度为O(ε^-1τ^-1)，其中τ为局部训练步数。

Conclusion: 该算法在减少通信的同时保持了协调性，数值实验验证了理论结果的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Motivation: 解决当前机器学习在无监督条件下发现类别、检测新颖性和适应新环境方面的挑战，受婴儿认知能力启发。

Method: 使用有限分辨率聚类框架，采用单一分辨率参数和吸引-排斥动态机制，并引入mheatmap评估方法。

Result: 在标准聚类指标上具有竞争力，新颖性检测AUC达到87%，动态类别演化中稳定性提升35%。

Conclusion: 配置框架为早期认知分类提供了原则性计算模型，是迈向大脑启发AI的重要一步。

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

TL;DR: SPOT是一种用于计算决策树策略的新方法，将优化问题表述为混合整数线性规划，通过解耦MDP动态和树结构约束实现高效并行搜索，显著提升运行时间和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可解释强化学习策略对于高风险决策至关重要，但在马尔可夫决策过程中优化决策树策略仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将优化问题表述为混合整数线性规划，采用缩减空间的分支定界方法，解耦MDP动态和树结构约束，实现高效并行搜索。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SPOT实现了显著加速，可扩展到具有更多状态的更大MDP，产生的决策树策略可解释且紧凑，在保持透明度的同时不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，比现有方法快一个数量级地提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SILVER with RL-guided labeling，通过将RL策略自身的动作输出整合到边界点识别中，扩展了SILVER框架到多动作和高维环境，提升了深度强化学习的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能卓越但缺乏可解释性，限制了对其策略行为的信任。现有的SILVER框架仅适用于低维、二元动作领域，需要扩展到更复杂的环境。

Method: 首先从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，进行SHAP特征归因，然后使用RL引导标记生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，结果表明该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将SILVER转化为可扩展且行为感知的框架，推进了可解释强化学习在高维多动作设置中的应用。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类具有按相似性分组对象的内在能力，聚类算法旨在模拟这种认知机制。最近社区检测的进展使得能够在多个分辨率尺度上发现配置（有效的层次聚类），而无需标记数据。

Method: 引入GraMixC，一个即插即用模块，提取配置，使用反向合并/拆分（RMS）技术对齐它们，并通过注意力头融合它们，然后将其转发到任何下游预测器。

Result: 在DSN1 16S rRNA培养介质预测任务中，GraMixC将R2分数从0.6提高到0.9，在多个方法中设定了新的最先进水平。在标准表格基准测试中，它持续优于单分辨率和静态特征基线。

Conclusion: 配置表现出较低的冗余性，并且消除了临时选择的需要。它们可以通过无监督或自监督方法学习，但其选择或组合仍然特定于下游任务和输入。

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对分类任务和表示级去偏，无法充分处理节点级回归任务的连续特性，因此需要专门针对回归任务的公平性框架。

Method: 在三个层次进行干预：结构级边重加权、表示级MMD对齐、预测级基于Sinkhorn的分布匹配归一化。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，FnRGNN能够减少群体差异，同时不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: FnRGNN通过多级策略在复杂图拓扑下实现了稳健的公平性，为GNN节点回归任务提供了有效的公平性解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型虽然比Transformer更具可扩展性，但训练成本高且生态系统不成熟，且与Transformer的结构异质性使得知识蒸馏困难

Method: CAB框架使用轻量级注意力桥接实现token级监督，并采用灵活的层间对齐策略来处理师生模型间的架构差异

Result: 在视觉和语言领域的广泛实验表明，该方法在有限训练数据下持续提升状态空间模型性能，优于标准和跨架构蒸馏方法

Conclusion: 基于注意力的知识可以高效转移到循环模型中，有助于快速利用Transformer专业知识来构建更强的SSM社区

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为高斯蒸馏的新方法，通过深度隐因子模型将教师集成压缩为学生分布，而不是学生集成，以解决知识蒸馏中不确定性保留不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度集成虽然能提供最先进的不确定性量化，但计算和内存需求大，难以部署到实际应用中。现有的知识蒸馏技术难以有效保留不确定性，因为减小DNN尺寸通常会导致变异减少。

Method: 使用深度隐因子模型（DLF）将教师集成视为某个随机过程的实现，通过期望最大化（EM）算法稳定估计DLF模型的均值和协方差函数，实现从教师集成到学生分布的压缩。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，高斯蒸馏方法优于现有基线方法，并且在语言模型微调和分布偏移问题上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏是一种有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够成功压缩教师集成并保留不确定性，在多种应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

TL;DR: 提出QiMeng-SALV方法，通过利用功能正确的输出信号代码段来优化Verilog代码生成的强化学习训练，实现从模块级到信号级的细粒度优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在Verilog代码生成方面取得显著进展，但缺乏有意义的功能奖励阻碍了基于强化学习的偏好优化，无法生成功能正确的Verilog代码。

Method: 通过比较生成模块与参考模块的信号功能正确性，使用抽象语法树识别信号感知代码段，引入信号感知DPO在正确的信号级代码段上进行优化。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM上实现最先进性能，7B参数模型性能与DeepSeek v3 671B模型相当，显著优于在同一数据集上训练的开源模型CodeV。

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV标志着Verilog代码生成从传统模块级优化向细粒度信号级优化的范式转变，解决了功能奖励不足的问题。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Loopholing机制解决离散扩散模型采样时的信息丢失问题，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，显著提升文本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在并行解码时存在采样墙问题：一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息就会坍缩为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤信息受限。

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，结合自条件策略高效训练，构建Loopholing离散扩散模型(LDDMs)。

Result: 生成困惑度比基线降低高达61%，接近甚至超过自回归模型性能，生成文本更连贯，在Countdown和Game of 24等算术推理任务上表现提升。

Conclusion: Loopholing机制缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的高质量路径。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的预测形式对实际应用价值的影响，指出虽然这些模型在预测精度上表现良好，但预测形式（点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成）决定了其能支持的操作任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TSFMs主要关注预测精度，但忽略了预测形式对实际应用价值的关键影响。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测来保持时间依赖性，而大多数TSFMs只产生点预测或参数预测。

Method: 通过调查近期TSFMs，分析不同预测类型之间的转换可能性，证明边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并将六种基本预测任务映射到最小充分预测类型。

Result: 研究发现三分之二的TSFMs只产生点预测或参数预测，而轨迹集成可以转换为更简单的形式，但反向转换需要额外假设。建立了任务对齐的评估框架。

Conclusion: 预测类型而非精度决定了实际效用，需要根据具体操作任务选择合适的预测形式，轨迹集成对于需要时间依赖性的任务至关重要。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Result: 成功生成了与原始样本显著不同但模型输出相同的负对抗样本，发现这类样本广泛分布在样本空间中，而不仅限于原始样本邻域。

Conclusion: 负对抗样本揭示了模型决策边界的更完整特性，表明对抗样本不仅存在于原始样本附近，而是广泛分布在样本空间中，这对理解模型安全性和鲁棒性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Motivation: 分支定界求解器的性能关键取决于变量选择启发式方法，现有研究尝试将RL算法应用于B&B设置来学习最优分支策略，但需要更原则性的MDP公式。

Method: 提出了BBMDP——一种用于B&B变量选择的标准MDP公式，允许利用广泛的RL算法来学习最优B&B启发式策略。

Result: 计算实验验证了该模型的有效性，提出的分支智能体在四个标准MILP基准测试中超越了先前最先进的RL智能体。

Conclusion: BBMDP提供了一个原则性的MDP框架，能够有效学习最优分支策略，在MILP问题求解中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的可扩展LinUCB算法显著降低了计算和内存需求，同时保持了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Method: 使用ConvXformer混合架构，融合ConvNeXt块和Transformer编码器；提出自适应梯度裁剪和梯度对齐噪声注入的差分隐私机制；利用截断奇异值分解进行梯度处理。

Result: 在OxIOD、RIDI、RoNIN基准数据集上，ConvXformer超越现有方法，定位精度提升超过40%，同时确保(ε,δ)-差分隐私保证；在KAIST机械工程大楼收集的Mech-IO数据集上验证了在严重环境干扰下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架在恶劣环境干扰下表现出鲁棒性，适用于网络物理系统中的安全智能导航。

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种从多变量时间序列中提取系统"年龄"代理特征的方法，通过优化公式的单调性来发现能代表系统老化过程的潜在特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据可能无法直接提供"年龄"信息。需要从现有数据中发现能代表系统老化过程的代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化公式与时间之间的Spearman秩相关系数的绝对值来评估单调性，选择最单调的特征作为年龄代理。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法能将单调性较低的单传感器特征组合成单调性高的潜在特征。在InfraWatch结构健康监测项目中，两个Spearman ρ值分别为0.13和0.09的特征被组合成ρ值为0.95的代理特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能够找到可解释的公式作为系统"年龄"的有效代理，即使单个传感器的单调性很低，也能通过组合发现高质量的年龄代理特征。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态、质量感知的图文本对齐框架，通过实时评估监督质量，在表达性多对多和保守一对一目标之间动态调整，解决了现有图文本对齐方法在处理多对多关系和噪声监督时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP风格的图文本对齐方法面临两个关键限制：假设节点和文本之间存在严格的一对一对应关系，忽略了现实世界图中固有的多对多关系；依赖静态对齐目标无法适应变化的数据质量，在噪声监督下变得脆弱。

Method: ADAligner框架实时估计批次级别的对齐可靠性，并根据监督质量动态调整优化策略：当监督干净时促进软性、子图级别的多对多对齐，在噪声情况下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上持续优于先前的图文本对齐方法，在噪声监督下保持强鲁棒性，相比多模态基线加速预训练约2到3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为现实世界网络环境中的图文本表示学习建立了一个可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态质量感知机制解决了图文本对齐中的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

TL;DR: 提出CPSVD方法，通过智能分割参数矩阵来改进基于SVD的LLM压缩，直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差列应用SVD，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD方法将整个参数矩阵统一处理，忽视了SVD近似误差在不同矩阵部分存在显著差异，导致压缩效果不理想。

Method: CPSVD方法识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差列应用SVD，同时自适应地为LLM中不同模块分配非均匀压缩率。

Result: 大量实验表明CPSVD在零样本任务上持续优于最先进的基于SVD的LLM压缩方法，实现了更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，显著提升了SVD在LLM压缩中的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应秩分配方法（ARA），用于解决大语言模型SVD压缩中不同线性模块的秩分配问题，通过专用掩码设计和额外损失函数实现全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法存在局限性：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以有效捕捉奇异值谱与可训练参数的关系，且忽略了增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优。

Method: ARA方法包含两个关键设计：(1)专用掩码设计，实现保留秩与可训练参数之间的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数，引导参数选择朝向全局最优解。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型上，80%压缩比下，WikiText2困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: ARA方法在SVD基LLM压缩中实现了最先进的秩分配性能，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

Result: 在经典基准问题上，该方法在性能上优于最先进算法，并在整个频域上显示出改进的逼近能力。

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN通过傅里叶特征增强有效克服了频谱偏差，能够准确逼近高频率PDE，且迭代训练方案具有收敛性保证。

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

Method: 集成偏置检测器与条件低秩适应(LoRA)，使用对比损失函数训练LoRA模块以减少不同敏感群体间的类内表示差异。

Result: 理论分析表明在偏置检测器中等TPR/FPR下，FairNet能提升最差群体性能而不降低整体性能，甚至可能带来轻微性能提升。

Conclusion: FairNet框架能灵活处理完整、部分或完全缺失的敏感属性标签场景，在多种视觉和语言基准测试中验证了有效性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

Conclusion: 该自举框架通过直接针对挤压效应，解决了现有遗忘学习方法中的虚假遗忘问题，为语言模型的安全部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定的dropout率，有效处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，为多任务少样本学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Motivation: 重新检验Jones等人(2022)提出的修正普适性假设，该假设认为针对特定任务的对抗鲁棒训练模型具有高度相似性，测试该假设的普适性。

Method: 在不同数据集上验证表示相似性，分析预测行为随鲁棒性的变化趋势，识别预测分歧的来源，并通过重新训练分类器来测试预测行为的可统一性。

Result: 在特定设置下验证了Jones的主要主张，即高度表示相似性，但结果在不同数据集间不一致；预测行为不会随鲁棒性增加而收敛；预测分歧主要来自分类层；通过重新训练分类器可以实现更普遍的预测行为。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下具有部分普适性，但远离严格普适性的概念，支持部分普适性的观点。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict

TL;DR: g-DPO通过序列空间聚类和分组近似方法解决了DPO训练时间随数据集规模二次增长的问题，在保持性能的同时显著加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO方法在蛋白质语言模型对齐中面临可扩展性瓶颈，训练对数量随标记序列数呈二次增长，导致训练时间过长。

Method: 使用序列空间聚类修剪冗余训练对，并通过分组近似方法分摊似然计算成本。

Result: 在三个蛋白质工程任务中，g-DPO保持与标准DPO相当的体外和计算机性能，同时收敛速度快1.8到3.7倍。

Conclusion: g-DPO是DPO的高效替代方案，尤其适用于大规模数据集，能够显著减少训练时间而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Result: 系统性地识别了思维链监控面临的主要威胁类型，并提出了相应的应对策略和技术评估框架。

Conclusion: 思维链监控可能支持控制和可信度安全案例，为高能力AI系统提供可行的安全防护路径。

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Conclusion: INPO框架成功解决了图遗忘过程中模型效用下降的问题，在保持遗忘质量的同时维持了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELUTQ是一个高效的量化框架，通过引入分层线性量化(HLQ)格式，在CPU边缘设备上实现低比特量化，消除反量化开销，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPU边缘设备上部署大型语言模型面临内存和计算资源有限的挑战，现有硬件友好的均匀量化方法无法很好地适应权重分布，且在低比特宽度下反量化开销较高。

Method: 提出ELUTQ框架，引入分层线性量化(HLQ)格式，在不增加位串行查找表GEMM操作计算成本的情况下更好地捕捉权重统计特征，消除反量化开销，并提供优化的CPU内核进行端到端推理。

Result: 对于LLaMA3-8B，HLQ在3位精度下降低困惑度约8%，在2位精度下降低85%，量化过程在1小时内完成。通过高效微调，2位性能在2小时内进一步提升。在Apple M2芯片上，2位LLaMA2-7B实现超过25 tokens/s的推理速度。

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架通过HLQ量化格式有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，在保持低比特精度的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

TL;DR: SpikeQuant是一种结合脉冲神经网络和混合精度量化的方法，通过将显著激活值重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，实现动态混合存储，并将量化尺度嵌入IF机制阈值，避免显式反量化，在W4A4量化下达到接近FP16的困惑度，同时能耗降低4.6倍。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在边缘设备部署中的三个关键挑战：MAC操作能耗高、反量化引入额外开销、均匀位宽量化会裁剪显著值。受脉冲神经网络二进制脉冲表示和IF机制的启发，利用其天然支持混合精度存储和高效计算的特点。

Method: 选择性对显著激活值应用混合精度量化，将其重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，实现不同位宽的动态混合存储。将量化尺度嵌入IF机制的阈值中，在权重和激活上执行高效线性变换，避免显式反量化操作。

Result: 在W4A4量化设置下，SpikeQuant能够持续达到接近FP16的困惑度表现，同时相比现有方法将能耗降低了最高4.6倍。

Conclusion: SpikeQuant证明了结合脉冲神经网络特性和混合精度量化的有效性，为大语言模型在能量受限硬件上的准确且高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

Motivation: 单模型一致性方法在LLM幻觉检测和缓解方面已有先进成果，但受限于训练数据的不完善（包括偏见和信息不足），需要进一步改进。

Method: 扩展单模型一致性方法，将来自多个不同LLM的响应进行组合，形成联盟一致性方法，探索不同LLM组合的条件。

Result: 多模型一致性方法在幻觉检测和缓解能力上相比单模型一致性方法有显著提升，且通常伴随推理成本的降低。

Conclusion: 联盟一致性方法通过利用多个LLM的多样性，在提升性能的同时解决了单模型一致性方法推理成本高的缺点。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出Bi-level Decision-Focused Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL)方法，解决在线平台营销中的预测-决策不匹配和偏差-方差权衡问题，通过双层优化框架联合利用观察数据和实验数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台需要优化营销策略以提升用户留存和收入，传统两阶段方法存在预测-决策不匹配问题，且观察数据存在偏差而实验数据稀缺，导致偏差-方差困境。

Method: 开发基于实验数据的无偏OR决策质量估计器，通过代理损失函数连接离散优化梯度；建立双层优化框架，通过隐式微分联合利用观察和实验数据，校正学习方向。

Result: 在公共基准测试、工业营销数据集和大规模在线A/B测试中验证了Bi-DFCL的有效性，相比现有方法取得统计显著改进，已在美团平台部署。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL成功解决了营销优化中的核心挑战，实现了预测与决策的协同优化，在真实工业场景中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化方法存在显著的单步偏差，容易收敛到局部最优，在复杂或高维任务中表现不佳。

Method: 将高斯过程用于局部指导，能量基模型捕获全局结构信息，将每次贝叶斯优化迭代定义为马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO算法进行自适应多步前瞻。

Conclusion: REBMBO通过结合局部和全局信息，以及自适应多步前瞻策略，有效克服了传统贝叶斯优化的局限性，在各种任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: MED-LQ展示了在大规模马尔可夫决策过程中更广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Conclusion: 联邦聚类方法在分子数据多样性分析中具有潜力，但需要结合领域知识和化学感知评估指标来获得更准确的结果。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Method: 基于XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM的集成模型，结合高分辨率特征学习和长程时间依赖捕获机制，通过自回归模块训练气候控制的滞后关系，使用随机推理返回概率区间。

Result: 在34个美国州份的评估中，ForecastNet-XCL可靠地优于统计基线、单个神经网络和传统集成方法，在州内和跨州场景中均保持准确性，特别是在具有不规则或两年期RSV模式的地区表现更好。

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL的效率、性能和不确定性感知设计使其成为在气候压力加剧和监测资源受限情况下的可部署早期预警工具。

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

TL;DR: DiffEvac是一种基于生成模型的新方法，通过学习建筑疏散模式实现高效疏散模拟，相比传统方法建模负担更小、速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细化建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段进行快速迭代，需要更高效的方法来支持建筑设计安全优化。

Method: 首先建立399个不同功能布局和对应疏散热力图的数据集，提出解耦特征表示来嵌入物理特征，然后基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比使用条件GAN和RGB表示的现有研究，DiffEvac在SSIM上提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度快16倍，模拟时间缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了快速设计迭代效率，为智能建筑设计中的安全优化提供了新的技术路径，能够降低建模负担并支持大规模假设探索。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体缺乏明确区分任务相关信息与残差信息的机制，限制了在下游任务中的表现。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习两个不同的潜在空间，通过新颖的证据下界公式促进潜在空间之间的因子分解，一个空间专门用于任务显著特征，另一个用于残差信息。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA始终优于标准LoRA。虚假相关性评估证实FVAE-LoRA能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过明确分离任务相关特征和残差信息，显著提升了LoRA的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的重叠加权正交元学习器，用于在时间变化设置中估计异质性治疗效果，解决了现有方法在治疗重叠不足时的方差爆炸问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间变化环境中估计异质性治疗效果时，由于观察某些治疗序列的概率随预测时间范围呈指数下降，导致数据支持不足，产生严重的重叠问题。现有元学习器假设充分治疗重叠，在重叠不足时会出现估计方差爆炸。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的重叠加权正交元学习器，通过目标化观察数据中高概率接受干预治疗序列的区域，采用数据驱动方法抵消现有元学习器的不稳定性。方法包括开发Neyman正交总体风险函数，最小化重叠加权的oracle风险。

Result: WO学习器具有Neyman正交性的有利特性，对干扰函数错误设定具有鲁棒性。该学习器完全模型无关，可应用于任何机器学习模型。通过使用transformer和LSTM骨干网络的广泛实验证明了其优势。

Conclusion: 提出的重叠加权正交元学习器能够有效解决时间变化环境中治疗重叠不足的问题，提供更可靠的异质性治疗效果估计，具有模型无关性和对错误设定的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究带弃权机制的政策学习，允许政策在不确定时选择安全默认选项，并提出了两阶段学习方法和双重稳健目标，在已知和未知倾向得分情况下都获得了快速收敛的遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统政策学习方法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中存在风险。需要开发能够弃权的政策学习算法，允许在不确定时选择安全选项。

Method: 提出两阶段学习方法：首先识别一组近似最优政策，然后基于它们的分歧构建弃权规则。使用双重稳健目标处理未知倾向得分情况。

Result: 在已知倾向得分时获得O(1/n)型快速遗憾保证，在未知倾向得分时通过双重稳健目标扩展这些保证。弃权机制还能改善边际条件下的性能，连接分布鲁棒政策学习，并支持安全政策改进。

Conclusion: 弃权是政策学习中的多功能工具，能处理预测不确定性，改善性能保证，连接鲁棒学习，并确保安全改进，为高风险决策提供更可靠的框架。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

Motivation: 随着模型规模增大而部署环境资源受限，内存高效的深度神经网络训练变得日益重要。

Method: 提出动态通道选择方法，在预选层中随机重采样通道，结合架构相关的先验层重要性确定。

Result: 在多种下游任务和架构上达到最先进性能，实现99%激活稀疏度、95%权重导数稀疏度和97%权重导数计算FLOPs减少。

Conclusion: TraDy在保持严格内存约束的同时，实现了高效的深度学习训练，为大规模模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict
resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme
leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is
architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict
memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight
derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative
computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了分层推测解码（HSD）算法，通过将多个不同大小的草稿模型堆叠成层次结构来加速Transformer语言模型推理，相比最佳单草稿模型基线可带来最高1.2倍的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法通常只使用单个草稿模型，但实际上存在一系列从快速但不准确到缓慢但可靠的潜在草稿模型。为了进一步降低推理延迟，需要利用多个草稿模型的层次结构来优化性能。

Method: HSD算法将多个草稿模型堆叠成层次结构，每个模型生成token，下一个更大的模型在单次前向传播中验证这些token，最终由目标模型验证所有token。算法推导了任意层次结构的期望延迟表达式，并证明可以在多项式时间内选择延迟最优的层次结构。

Result: 实验表明，HSD相比最佳单草稿模型基线可带来最高1.2倍的加速效果，证明了该算法在减少生成延迟方面的实用性。

Conclusion: 分层推测解码通过利用多个草稿模型的层次结构，能够有效降低Transformer语言模型的推理延迟，超越了之前的技术限制。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

TL;DR: SEMPO是一个轻量级时间序列基础模型，通过能量感知频谱分解和混合提示Transformer，在减少预训练数据规模和模型大小的同时，实现了强大的时序预测泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型需要大规模预训练数据和庞大网络架构，难以在资源受限环境中部署，需要在通用性和可负担性之间找到平衡。

Method: 1) 能量感知频谱分解模块：同时建模高能量和低能量频率信号；2) 混合提示Transformer：通过数据集特定提示学习异构时序模式，自适应路由到基于提示的专家进行参数高效适配。

Result: 在包含16个数据集的两个大规模基准测试中，SEMPO在零样本和少样本预测场景下均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: SEMPO显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小，同时实现了强大的泛化能力，为资源受限环境下的时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Enhanced TimeAutoDiff框架，利用合成ICU时间序列数据来训练和评估预测模型，显著减少了真实-合成数据评估差距，并在细粒度人口亚组中提供更准确的性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗AI中模型评估的挑战，特别是在保护患者隐私的同时，需要在细粒度人口亚组中进行可靠的性能分析，避免暴露敏感的电子健康记录数据。

Method: 基于先前的扩散和VAE生成器（TimeDiff、HealthGen、TimeAutoDiff），引入Enhanced TimeAutoDiff，在潜在扩散目标中增加了分布对齐惩罚项。

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实-合成数据评估差距减少了70%以上，达到ΔTRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC，同时保持训练实用性（ΔTSTR ≈ 0.01）。在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差减少了50%，并在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 这项工作为重症监护中可信赖、细粒度的模型评估提供了实用的隐私保护路线图，能够在不同患者群体中进行稳健可靠的性能分析，有助于提升医疗AI的整体可信度。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Motivation: 在高风险应用中部署SGD需要严格量化其固有不确定性，现有方法计算成本高且维度扩展受限。

Method: 使用在线SGD方法，开发在线方差估计器，并建立该估计器的高概率偏差界。

Result: 当迭代次数增长为t ≳ d^{1+δ}时，SGD迭代满足CLT，运行时间为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，优于协方差逆方法的O(td² + d³)。

Conclusion: 提出了第一个完全在线和数据驱动的框架，在接近最优的缩放机制t ≳ d^{1+δ}下为SGD迭代构建置信区间。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

Method: 使用简化的解耦Transformer架构，理论分析L层模型能解决直径不超过3^L的图连通性问题，相当于计算邻接矩阵的幂次。分析训练动态，研究训练数据是否在模型容量范围内对学习策略的影响。

Result: 理论证明L层模型能解决直径不超过3^L的图连通性问题。实证表明：当训练数据在模型容量内时，模型学习正确的算法；当超出容量时，模型学习基于节点度的简单启发式方法。限制训练数据在容量范围内可使标准和解耦Transformer都学习精确算法。

Conclusion: Transformer学习算法还是启发式方法取决于训练数据是否在模型容量范围内。在容量内学习正确算法，超出容量则学习简单启发式。通过限制训练数据在模型容量内，可以促进Transformer学习通用算法而非脆弱的启发式方法。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽略预测不确定性，缺乏将不确定性纳入的机制和形式化保证，可能导致解释不可靠。

Method: 结合共形预测和混合整数线性规划，通过离线树基输入空间分区开发局部化CP程序，实现高效MILP编码。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上优于现有方法，产生更鲁棒和合理的解释。

Conclusion: CONFEX方法能够生成具有严格预测不确定性和最优性保证的反事实解释，解决了CFX生成违反可交换性的问题。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Conclusion: 该方法为评估模型隐私风险提供了一种高效实用的替代方案，特别是在大型语言模型风险评估方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

Motivation: 稀疏微调技术的效果依赖于最优选择要微调的模型参数，现有方法在参数选择上仍有改进空间。

Method: GaLLoP仅微调那些在下游任务上梯度幅度最大且预训练幅度最小的参数，优先选择任务相关性强但对预训练知识破坏最小的参数。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上持续优于或匹配其他参数高效微调技术（如LoRA、DoRA、SAFT），并能减轻灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题。

Conclusion: GaLLoP通过保持重要预训练参数不变，稳定了性能表现，并在大多数随机种子下展现出鲁棒的泛化能力。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

TL;DR: DynaInfer是一种无需环境标签即可推断环境规范的新方法，通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来实现环境分配，在无标签场景下有效解决交替优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法依赖I.I.D.数据假设，环境差异处理技术需要环境标签，但实际中由于数据采集挑战、隐私问题和环境变异性，环境标签往往在训练时不可得。

Method: 提出DynaInfer方法，通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，直接从数据中实现环境分配。

Result: 实验表明DynaInfer优于现有环境分配技术，能快速收敛到真实标签，甚至在环境标签可用时也能获得更优性能。

Conclusion: DynaInfer为处理无环境标签的动态系统分析提供了有效解决方案，在多种动态系统中表现出色。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种检测模型衍生使用的方法，通过分析训练数据顺序与模型输出的相关性来证明Bob是否使用了Alice的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何证明他人使用了基于自己开源模型开发的衍生模型的问题，无论是通过查询衍生模型还是仅从输出文本中检测。

Method: 将问题建模为独立性测试，利用语言模型对训练后期数据记忆更强的特性，通过测试统计量检测Bob模型或文本与Alice训练数据顺序的相关性。

Result: 在查询设置中，通过提示估计衍生模型对训练示例和顺序的似然度，在40多个微调模型上获得了p值≤1e-8的显著结果；在观察设置中，通过两种方法成功从几百个token中可靠地区分Bob的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测模型衍生使用，为模型所有权验证提供了统计上可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

*Roey Magen,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论上证明，通过梯度下降训练的简化Transformer架构可以在线性分类设置中作为接近最优的元学习器，仅需少量上下文示例就能泛化到新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer展示了出色的上下文学习能力，但现有理论分析大多未涉及正式的元学习设置。本文旨在从理论上研究Transformer是否能在元学习框架下，通过少量上下文示例高效适应新任务。

Method: 使用简化的Transformer架构，在类别条件高斯混合模型的任务族上进行训练，其中均值向量位于共享的k维子空间中。通过梯度下降训练模型，使其能够利用任务间的共享结构。

Result: 训练后的Transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，这几乎与知道共享子空间的最优学习器性能匹配，且显著优于仅依赖上下文数据的学习器（后者需要Ω(d/R^4)个示例）。

Conclusion: Transformer确实可以作为有效的元学习器，利用任务间的共享结构实现高效学习，所需训练任务和每任务示例数量与高维环境维度d无关。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了全球南北之间的结构性不对称，需要研究中等收入国家在硬件受限条件下建立可持续AI能力的可行性。

Method: 采用双轴设计，比较不同加速器（H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），评估10万亿token模型的算力需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置都低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，H100方案总成本为8-14百万美元，A100方案为19-32百万美元，硬件效率决定财政可行性。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间应作为缓解硬件约束的政策工具，使中等收入国家能够在不参与全球前沿竞争的情况下，生产可用、可审计且本地对齐的模型。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

Result: 该方法在开放端机器人任务上实现了策略改进，相比基于重建的世界模型范式获得了显著的泛化提升。

Conclusion: 语义世界模型能够继承预训练视觉语言模型的泛化和鲁棒性特性，为机器人决策规划提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

Motivation: 构建高血压数字孪生，提供比传统0D模型更详细的心室变形和应力评估，实现实时高血压控制。

Method: 采用0D RLC电路模型（有/无毛细血管变体）和3D-0D机电模型耦合方法，进行单参数和多参数敏感性分析，开发参数校准策略。

Result: 3D-0D模型能准确表示高血压下的心血管循环动态，提供比纯0D模型更精细的临床见解。

Conclusion: 3D-0D模型是实现高血压实时控制数字孪生的重要进展，超越0D模型的临床价值。

Abstract: In this work, we develop patient-specific cardiocirculatory models with the
aim of building Digital Twins for hypertension. In particular, in our
pathophysiology-based framework, we consider both 0D cardiocirculatory models
and a 3D-0D electromechanical model. The 0D model, which consists of an RLC
circuit, is studied in two variants, with and without capillaries. The 3D-0D
model consists of a three-dimensional electromechanical model of the left
ventricle, coupled with a 0D model for the external blood circulation: this
representation enables the assessment of additional quantities related to
ventricular deformation and stress, and offers a more detailed representation
compared to a fully 0D model. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the 0D
model, with both a mono- and a multi-parametric approach, in order to identify
the parameters that most influence the model outputs and guide the calibration
process. We studied three different scenarios, corresponding to systemic,
pulmonary and renovascular hypertension, each in three nuances of severity. To
maintain a fair comparison among the models, a parameter calibration strategy
is developed; the outputs of the 0D model with capillaries are utilized to
enhance the 3D-0D model. The results demonstrate that the 3D-0D model yields an
accurate representation of cardiocirculatory dynamics in the presence of
hypertension; this model represents a powerful step toward digital twins for
real-time hypertension control, providing refined and clinically meaningful
insights beyond those achievable with 0D models alone.

Motivation: 虽然数值实验显示GFSI算法在多组分BEC中计算基态时具有能量耗散特性，但严格的数学证明一直是个开放性问题。

Method: 通过引入拉格朗日乘子，将GFSI重新表述为等价形式，从而在具有Josephson结和旋转项的双组分BEC模型中证明能量耗散。

Result: 成功证明了GFSI在双组分BEC中的能量耗散性质，并建立了向稳态的全局收敛性。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: GFSI算法在双组分BEC中确实具有能量耗散特性，且保证能量耗散的时间步长上限与粒子相互作用强度相关。

Abstract: The gradient flow with semi-implicit discretization (GFSI) is the most widely
used algorithm for computing the ground state of Gross-Pitaevskii energy
functional. Numerous numerical experiments have shown that the energy
dissipation holds when calculating the ground states of multicomponent
Bose-Einstein condensates (MBECs) with GFSI, while rigorous proof remains an
open challenge. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, we reformulate the GFSI
into an equivalent form and thereby prove the energy dissipation for GFSI in
two-component scenario with Josephson junction and rotating term, which is one
of the most important and topical model in MBECs. Based on this, we further
establish the global convergence to stationary states. Also, the numerical
results of energy dissipation in practical experiments corroborate our rigorous
mathematical proof, and we numerically verified the upper bound of time step
that guarantees energy dissipation is indeed related to the strength of
particle interactions.

Conclusion: DLRA-DEIM框架为大规模非线性矩阵微分方程提供了高效的计算方法，在保持精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) is a widely used paradigm for solving
large-scale matrix differential equations, as they arise, for example, from the
discretization of time-dependent partial differential equations on tensorized
domains. Through orthogonally projecting the dynamics onto the tangent space of
a low-dimensional manifold, DLRA achieves a significant reduction of the
storage required to represent the solution. However, the need for evaluating
the velocity field can make it challenging to attain a corresponding reduction
of computational cost in the presence of nonlinearities. In this work, we
address this challenge by replacing orthogonal tangent space projections with
oblique, data-sparse projections selected by a discrete empirical interpolation
method (DEIM). At the continuous-time level, this leads to DLRA-DEIM, a
well-posed differential inclusion (in the Filippov sense) that captures the
discontinuities induced by changes in the indices selected by DEIM. We
establish an existence result, exactness property and error bound for DLRA-DEIM
that match existing results for DLRA. For the particular case of QDEIM, a
popular variant of DEIM, we provide an explicit convex-polytope
characterization of the differential inclusion. Building on DLRA-DEIM, we
propose a new class of projected integrators, called PRK-DEIM, that combines
explicit Runge--Kutta methods with DEIM-based projections. We analyze the
convergence order of PRK-DEIM and show that it matches the accuracy of
previously proposed projected Runge-Kutta methods, while being significantly
cheaper. Extensions to exponential Runge--Kutta methods and low-order tensor
differential equations demonstrate the versatility of our framework.

Conclusion: 提出的NSSDA框架成功地将物理结构信息同时融入预测和数据同化阶段，在高度约束环境下仅使用单一噪声轨迹就能实现准确的状态估计。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) methods combine model predictions with observational
data to improve state estimation in dynamical systems, inspiring their
increasingly prominent role in geophysical and climate applications. Classical
DA methods assume that the governing equations modeling the dynamics are known,
which is unlikely for most real world applications. Machine learning (ML)
provides a flexible alternative by learning surrogate models directly from
data, but standard ML methods struggle in noisy and data-scarce environments,
where meaningful extrapolation requires incorporating physical constraints.
Recent advances in structure-preserving ML architectures, such as the
development of the entropy-stable conservative flux form network (ESCFN),
highlight the critical role of physical structure in improving learning
stability and accuracy for unknown systems of conservation laws. Structural
information has also been shown to improve DA performance. Gradient-based
measures of spatial variability, in particular, can help refine ensemble
updates in discontinuous systems. Motivated by both of these recent
innovations, this investigation proposes a new non-intrusive,
structure-preserving sequential data assimilation (NSSDA) framework that
leverages structure at both the forecast and analysis stages. We use the ESCFN
to construct a surrogate model to preserve physical laws during forecasting,
and a structurally informed ensemble transform Kalman filter (SETKF) to embed
local statistical structure into the assimilation step. Our method operates in
a highly constrained environment, using only a single noisy trajectory for both
training and assimilation. Numerical experiments where the unknown dynamics
correspond respectively to the shallow water and Euler equations demonstrate
significantly improved predictive accuracy.

Abstract: A central goal in many brain studies is the identification of those brain
regions that are activated during an observation window that may correspond to
a motor task, a stimulus, or simply a resting state. While functional MRI is
currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on
the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of
their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are
directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the
hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating
the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL)
algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space
into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the
Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries
necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small
randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed
and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using
the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one
comprising dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, and
the second one performing dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary built on
the output of the first phase, both steps relying on Bayesian sparsity
promoting computations. For assessing the performance, we give a probabilistic
interpretation of the confusion matrix, and consider different impurity
measures for a multi-class classifier.

Abstract: We develop a positivity-preserving (PP) PAMPA (Point-Average-Moment
PolynomiAl-interpreted) scheme that enforces a discrete divergence-free (DDF)
magnetic field for ideal MHD on Cartesian grids. Extending our 1D
invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) PAMPA framework (Abgrall, Jiao, Liu, Wu, SIAM
J. Sci. Comput., to appear) to multidimensional, multiwave MHD, the method
combines a limiter-free PP update of interface point values via a new
nonconservative reformulation with a local DDF projection. Cell averages are
provably PP under a mild a~priori positivity condition on one cell-centered
state, using: (i) DDF-constrained interface values, (ii) a PP limiter only at
the cell center, (iii) a PP flux with appropriate wave-speed bounds, and (iv) a
suitable discretization of the Godunov--Powell source term. The PP proof
employs geometric quasi-linearization (GQL; Wu & Shu, SIAM Review, 2023), which
linearizes the pressure constraint. The scheme avoids explicit polynomial
reconstructions, is compatible with arbitrarily high-order
strong-stability-preserving (SSP) time integration, and is simple to implement.
Robustness and resolution are enhanced by a problem-independent Lax-type
entropy troubled-cell indicator using only two characteristic speeds and a
convex oscillation elimination (COE) mechanism with a new intercell-difference
norm. Tests -- including a blast wave with plasma $\beta \approx 2.51\times
10^{-6}$ and jets up to Mach $10^{4}$ -- show high-order accuracy, sharp
MHD-structure resolution, and strong-shock robustness. To our knowledge, this
is the first active-flux-type ideal-MHD method rigorously PP for both cell
averages and interface point values while maintaining DDF throughout.
