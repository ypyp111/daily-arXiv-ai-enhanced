The algorithm, based on the\nrecently developed WaveHoltz scheme, solves a related time-dependent wave\nequation as part of an iteration.

As the iteration progresses, the filtered\nsolution generally contains relatively larger and larger proportions of\neigenmodes whose eigenvalues are near a chosen target frequency (target\neigenvalue). The ability to choose an arbitrary target frequency enables the\ncomputation of eigenvalues anywhere in the spectrum, without the need to invert\nan indefinite matrix, as is common with other approaches.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based\nadaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of\n87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off\nrelative to our original early-stopping method."}

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior.

This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities."}

The framework\naddresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights\nprotection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.\nDefinitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts\nbetween competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic\nnature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis\nof AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and\nmulti-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we\nprovide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In\nparticular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the\ninteraction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,\nincorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments\nabout the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach\nallows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and\nGeneral Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the\nlatter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to\nenhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical\napplications to support responsible AI governance."}

When analyzed\non 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more\ndiverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.\nMoreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot\ndesign tasks.

Most open-source models are trained on datasets\nconsisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn\nand respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes.

Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was\napplied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to\nanalyze the difference in this uniformity between \\textit{Demodex}-negative and\n\\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a\nsignificant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,\nwith an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of\n0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework\nin curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for\nquantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics."}

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy.

In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector\nagainst LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\".

We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep\nlearning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow\npredictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal\ngraph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model\nmulti-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across\nurban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:\npretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and\nreinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS\nrecords from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,\nUrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban\nforecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities."}

This setting\nnaturally raises fundamental questions: {\\it What kinds of additional\nsupervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\\it how do they contribute to\nimproved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a\ntheoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision\nas probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine\ncombination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of\nadditional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,\nbut rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled\nclasses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through\ngeneralization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional\nsupervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and\nasymptotic value of the error bound.

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,\nGoogle Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating\nsynthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a\nmoderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream\nNLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the\nreal documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming\nsparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind\ngenerating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to\ncheck for the existence of any sensitive information.

To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and\nincludes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As\nreference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail\nanalysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic\nsegmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual\ncontrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By\nproviding high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for\nmodel evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will\nfacilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for\nmore accurate climate impact understanding and assessments."}

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\narchitecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).\nTIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent\nirregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention\nmechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence\ninformation. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show\nthat TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%\nreduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below\n0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for\nbroader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series\ndata."}

Although numerous physically based and machine\nlearning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and\ncomputational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major\nchallenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological\nPrediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that\nleverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first\napplies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 \"uncalibrated\" catchment-based\nconceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear\nregression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that\nensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the\nrequired BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged\nbasins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from\n87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta\nEfficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)\nbut required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%\nof basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower\nuncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).\nThese results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not\nnecessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is\nassembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER\nprovides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge\nprediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide\nrange of regions."}

Complementing this, our block\nclustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large\n(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data\norganization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.\nTogether, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable\nto environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by\napproximately 30\\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like\nDELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution\nusing 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational\nefficiency."}

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs.

Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that\nsimply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop\nintrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety\n`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of\n$46.54\\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks\nwithout compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety\nperformance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude\nOpus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct\ninference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,\nenforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop\nSafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and\nSafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and\ncapability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of\nour framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI."}
